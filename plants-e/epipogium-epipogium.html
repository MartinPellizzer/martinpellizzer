<p>Epipogium epipogium, commonly known as the fairy slipper, is a rare and fascinating orchid that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, pouch-like flower that is typically white or pink with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
