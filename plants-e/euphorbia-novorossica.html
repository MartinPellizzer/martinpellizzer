<p>Euphorbia novorossica, commonly known as the Novorossiysk spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia novorossica is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
