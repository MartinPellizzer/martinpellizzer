                    <h1>Equisetum multiforme var. tenue</h1>
<p>Equisetum multiforme var. tenue, commonly known as slender field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies or in wetlands. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems are covered in a silica-rich cuticle that makes them abrasive.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
