<p>Echium argenteum, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking spikes of purple or blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Echium argenteum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
