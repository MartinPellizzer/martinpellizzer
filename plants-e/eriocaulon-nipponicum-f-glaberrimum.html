<p>Eriocaulon nipponicum f. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous spike-rush, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a dense spike of small, pale flowers. This fern-like plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a vulnerable or endangered species in its native range.</p>
