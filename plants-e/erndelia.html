<p>Erndelia, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green and float on the surface of the water. Its flowers are showy, with vibrant purple petals that bloom above the water. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative propagation, often forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments, impacting water ecosystems.</p>
