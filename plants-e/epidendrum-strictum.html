                    <h1>Epidendrum strictum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum strictum, commonly known as the rigid epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum strictum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
