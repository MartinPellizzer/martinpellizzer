<p>Eriosema bogdanii, commonly known as the mountain eriosema, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Eriosema bogdanii is often found in rocky outcrops and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
