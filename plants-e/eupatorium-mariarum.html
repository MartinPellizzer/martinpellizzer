<p>Eupatorium mariarum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eupatorium mariarum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
