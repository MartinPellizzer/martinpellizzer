                    <h1>Eriocnema hirsuta</h1>
<p>Eriocnema hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses a distinctive appearance with its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Eriocnema hirsuta plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing sustenance for wildlife.</p>
