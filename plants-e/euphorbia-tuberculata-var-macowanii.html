<p>Euphorbia tuberculata var. macowanii, commonly known as the Macowan's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
