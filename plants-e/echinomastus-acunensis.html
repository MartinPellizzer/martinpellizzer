                    <h1>Echinomastus acunensis</h1>
<p>Echinomastus acunensis, commonly known as the Andean spineflower, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for minimizing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Echinomastus acunensis is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
