<p>Epilobium erectum, commonly known as narrow-leaf willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist habitats such as streambanks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes, with pink to reddish-purple petals that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Epilobium erectum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators.</p>
