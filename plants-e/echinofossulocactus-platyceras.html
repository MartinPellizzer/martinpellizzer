<p>Echinofossulocactus platyceras, commonly known as the Mexican lion's mouth cactus, is a species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>

Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Echinofossulocactus platyceras is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
