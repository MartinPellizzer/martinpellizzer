                    <h1>Encephalartos</h1>
<p>Encephalartos, commonly known as the cycad, is a genus of plants native to Africa, characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>These plants are gymnosperms, meaning they produce seeds but do not flower, and they have a unique ability to store water in their thick, fleshy stems. Encephalartos species typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Their leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and they can live for many decades, sometimes even centuries.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils, offering insights into early plant evolution.</p>
