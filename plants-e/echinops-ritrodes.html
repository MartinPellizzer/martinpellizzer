                    <h1>Echinops ritrodes</h1>
<p>Echinops ritrodes, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed pods. Echinops ritrodes is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
