                    <h1>Elaphoglossum gracilifolium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum gracilifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the late spring and summer months. Elaphoglossum gracilifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and taxonomic contexts.</p>
