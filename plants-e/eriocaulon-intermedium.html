                    <h1>Eriocaulon intermedium</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon intermedium, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescence, which consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon intermedium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas effectively.</p>
