<p>Elatine lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindberg's waterwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Elatine lindbergii is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and water quality.</p>
