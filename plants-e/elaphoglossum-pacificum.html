<p>Elaphoglossum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum pacificum plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
