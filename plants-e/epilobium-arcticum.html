                    <h1>Epilobium arcticum</h1>
<p>Epilobium arcticum, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in freezing conditions.</p>
<p>Epilobium arcticum plays an important role in the Arctic ecosystem, providing food for herbivores and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
