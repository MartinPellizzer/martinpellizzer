                    <h1>Ekebergia welwitschii</h1>
<p>Ekebergia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater in the arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of the Namib Desert's harsh yet beautiful landscape.</p>
