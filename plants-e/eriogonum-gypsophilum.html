                    <h1>Eriogonum gypsophilum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum pricklygrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its jointed stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in gypsum soils, which are rich in calcium sulfate, and thrives in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom in late spring and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
