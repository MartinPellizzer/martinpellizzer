<p>Epidendrum anoglossum, commonly known as the "Lipstick Orchid," is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, lip-like flowers that are often red or orange in color. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive, elongated lip that is usually a different color from the rest of the flower.</p>
<p>Epidendrum anoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
