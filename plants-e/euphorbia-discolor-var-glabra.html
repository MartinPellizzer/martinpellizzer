                    <h1>Euphorbia discolor var. glabra</h1>
<p>Euphorbia discolor var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a smooth, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stem.</p>
<p>This variant is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
