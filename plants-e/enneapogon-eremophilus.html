<p>Enneapogon eremophilus, commonly known as the sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a hardy species in drought-prone areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
