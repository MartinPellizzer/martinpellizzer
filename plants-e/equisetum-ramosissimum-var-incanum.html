                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. incanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. incanum, commonly known as the silver fir or slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in small, scale-like structures that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ancient morphology reflects its status as one of the oldest groups of vascular plants.</p>
