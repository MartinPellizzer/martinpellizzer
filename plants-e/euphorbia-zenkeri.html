                    <h1>Euphorbia zenkeri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia zenkeri, commonly known as the Zanzibar spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it contains toxic milky sap that requires careful handling.</p>
