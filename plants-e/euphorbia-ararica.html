<p>Euphorbia ararica, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ararica contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
