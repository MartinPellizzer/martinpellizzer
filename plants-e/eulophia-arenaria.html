                    <h1>Eulophia arenaria</h1>
<p>Eulophia arenaria, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and bears clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in low-nutrient environments. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is typical for many orchid species.</p>
<p>Eulophia arenaria is often found in open habitats such as sand dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
