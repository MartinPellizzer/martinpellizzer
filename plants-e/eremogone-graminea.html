<p>Eremogone graminea, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, demonstrating high adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremogone graminea is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in dryland ecosystems.</p>
