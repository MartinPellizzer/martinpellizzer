<p>Euphorbia × jubaeaphylla, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
