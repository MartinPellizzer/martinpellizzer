                    <h1>Eria monophylla</h1>
<p>Eria monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its single, elongated leaf that serves as both a photosynthetic organ and a water-storing structure. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eria monophylla is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
