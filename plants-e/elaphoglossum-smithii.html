<p>Elaphoglossum smithii, commonly known as the Smith's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
