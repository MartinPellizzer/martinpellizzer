<p>Euploca uninervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined euploca, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a single prominent vein. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Euploca uninervis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical flora and plant morphology.</p>
