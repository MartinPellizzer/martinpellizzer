                    <h1>Espeletia glandulosa var. scaberrima</h1>
<p>Espeletia glandulosa var. scaberrima, commonly known as the rough-hairy espeletia, is a species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its foliage, giving it a rough and sometimes fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, where it forms part of the unique vegetation of the p√°ramo ecosystem. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are often small and clustered, contribute to its role as a pollinator attractant in its native habitat.</p>
