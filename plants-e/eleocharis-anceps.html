<p>Eleocharis anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny brown seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Eleocharis anceps plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
