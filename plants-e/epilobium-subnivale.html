                    <h1>Epilobium subnivale</h1>
<p>Epilobium subnivale, commonly known as snowbank willow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cold, moist environments such as snowbanks and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Epilobium subnivale is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions, with its growth cycle synchronized with the thawing of snow.</p>
