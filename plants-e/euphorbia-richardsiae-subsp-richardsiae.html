<p>Euphorbia richardsiae subsp.</p>
<p>richardsiae, commonly known as the Richards' spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a branching structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
