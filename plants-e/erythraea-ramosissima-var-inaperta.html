                    <h1>Erythraea ramosissima var. inaperta</h1>
<p>Erythraea ramosissima var. inaperta, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and dense, aromatic wood, which has historically been highly valued for its use in furniture and incense. The plant exhibits a unique branching pattern and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to the extreme climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
