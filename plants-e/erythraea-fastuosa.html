                    <h1>Erythraea fastuosa</h1>
<p>Erythraea fastuosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in lowland forests or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Erythraea fastuosa is now considered an endangered species in many areas.</p>
