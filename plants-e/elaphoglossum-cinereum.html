<p>Elaphoglossum cinereum, commonly known as the dark holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
