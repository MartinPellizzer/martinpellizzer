                    <h1>Elaeosticta alaica</h1>
<p>Elaeosticta alaica, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Elaeosticta alaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
