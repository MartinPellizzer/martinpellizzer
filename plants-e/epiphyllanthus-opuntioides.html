                    <h1>Epiphyllanthus opuntioides</h1>
<p>Epiphyllanthus opuntioides, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, a characteristic adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky soils and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
