                    <h1>Ehretia dissita</h1>
<p>Ehretia dissita, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches itself to host trees through its roots, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains one or two seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals.</p>
