                    <h1>Echinocactus longihamatus var. brevispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus longihamatus var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in short, pale spines, distinguishing it from other varieties of echinocactus. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
