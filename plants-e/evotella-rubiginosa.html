                    <h1>Evotella rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Evotella rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals with a dark purple hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Evotella rubiginosa is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
