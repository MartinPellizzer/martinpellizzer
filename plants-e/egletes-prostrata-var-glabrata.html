                    <h1>Egletes prostrata var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Egletes prostrata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, prostrate growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The leaves are narrow, oblanceolate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pale green or yellow and appear in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions with limited rainfall.</p>
