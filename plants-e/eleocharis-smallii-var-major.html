<p>Eleocharis smallii var. major, commonly known as the giant spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
