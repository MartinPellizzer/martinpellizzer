                    <h1>Euphorbia bartolomei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bartolomei, commonly known as the Bartolomei's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, which are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bartolomei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
