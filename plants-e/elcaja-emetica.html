<p>Elcaja emetica, commonly known as the emetic lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The name "emetica" refers to its historical use in inducing vomiting, though it is now primarily appreciated for its ornamental value.</p>
