<p>Epidendrum francisci, commonly known as the Saint Helena Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short, stocky rhizome and a few pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its island habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
