                    <h1>Elaphoglossum russelliae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum russelliae, commonly known as Russell's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
