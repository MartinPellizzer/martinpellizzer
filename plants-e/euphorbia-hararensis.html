                    <h1>Euphorbia hararensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hararensis, commonly known as the Harare euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hararensis is often found in rocky outcrops and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
