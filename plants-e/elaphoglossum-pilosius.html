<p>Elaphoglossum pilosius, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum pilosius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
