<p>Entolasia imbricata, commonly known as the rock wallaby or the rock wallaby lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a leathery texture and a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on limestone and sandstone surfaces, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
