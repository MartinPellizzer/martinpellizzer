<p>Euphorbia heldreichii var. roeseri, commonly known as the Balkan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
