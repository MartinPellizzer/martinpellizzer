<p>Euphorbia mcvaughiana, commonly known as the McVaugh's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its spiny stems and toxic sap serve as natural defenses against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia mcvaughiana is often found in rocky soils and is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
