                    <h1>Elacholoma hornii</h1>
<p>Elacholoma hornii, commonly known as the horned elacholoma, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Elacholomataceae, which is a small and less-studied group of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems, which are thought to play a role in its ecological interactions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elacholoma hornii is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
