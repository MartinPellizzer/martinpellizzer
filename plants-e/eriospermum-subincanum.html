<p>Eriospermum subincanum, commonly known as the silverleaf eriosperm, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Eriospermum subincanum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
