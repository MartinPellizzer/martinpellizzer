<p>Erica trimera subsp.</p>
<p>elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon heath, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly in the Aberdare and Mount Elgon areas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
