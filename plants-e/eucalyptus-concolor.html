                    <h1>Eucalyptus concolor</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus concolor, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-blue hue, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
