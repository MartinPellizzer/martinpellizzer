                    <h1>Echites procumbens</h1>
<p>Echites procumbens, commonly known as the creeping echites, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Echites procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
