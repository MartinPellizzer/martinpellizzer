                    <h1>Euphorbia velligera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia velligera, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia velligera is also known for its latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
