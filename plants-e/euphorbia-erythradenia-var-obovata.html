                    <h1>Euphorbia erythradenia var. obovata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia erythradenia var. obovata, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
