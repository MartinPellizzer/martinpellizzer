<p>Encephalartos villosus var. umbeluziensis, commonly known as the Umbeluzi cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of pale, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging higher up. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to humid, subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
