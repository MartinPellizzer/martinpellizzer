<p>Elymus glaber, commonly known as stiff false wheat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Elymus glaber is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
