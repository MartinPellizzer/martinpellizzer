<p>Euphorbia caeladenia, commonly known as the golden crown euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, surrounded by colorful bracts that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia caeladenia is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
