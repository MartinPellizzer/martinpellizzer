                    <h1>Euphorbia abortiva</h1>
<p>Euphorbia abortiva, commonly known as the aborted spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces toxic latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Euphorbia abortiva is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though its use requires caution due to its toxic compounds.</p>
