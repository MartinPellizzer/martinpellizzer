<p>Epithecia bryophila, commonly known as the mossy cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, leafy thalli on tree trunks and branches.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often white or pale yellow lower surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal mycelium.</p>
<p>Epithecia bryophila plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
