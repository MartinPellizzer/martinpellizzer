                    <h1>Eriosyce algarrobensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce algarrobensis, commonly known as the Algarrob√≥n cholla, is a species of cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in its natural habitat.</p>
