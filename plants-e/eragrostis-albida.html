                    <h1>Eragrostis albida</h1>
<p>Eragrostis albida, commonly known as white lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, white to pale green flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Eragrostis albida plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by providing food and habitat.</p>
