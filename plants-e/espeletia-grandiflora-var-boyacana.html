                    <h1>Espeletia grandiflora var. boyacana</h1>
<p>Espeletia grandiflora var. boyacana, commonly known as the "Boyacan Snowplant," is a striking alpine plant native to the Andes mountains of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces large, showy white or pale purple flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a symbol of the Andean cloud forests.</p>
