                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. ramosissimum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in soft, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of its primitive evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
