                    <h1>Elictotrichon</h1>
<p>Elictotrichon, commonly known as the bluegrass, is a genus of grasses native to North America.</p>
<p>These plants typically have fine, wiry leaves that are often bluish-green in color, which helps distinguish them from other grass species. Elictotrichon species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to form dense, sod-forming turf. They are often found in moist, well-drained soils and are common in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
