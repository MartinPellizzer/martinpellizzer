<p>Euphorbia remyi var. lydgatei, commonly known as the Lydgate's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences composed of modified leaves and flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
