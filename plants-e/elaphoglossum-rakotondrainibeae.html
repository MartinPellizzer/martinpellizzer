<p>[WRONG START] Elaphoglossum rakotondrainibeabe, commonly known as the Madagascar holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
