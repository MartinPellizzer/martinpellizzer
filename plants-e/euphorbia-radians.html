                    <h1>Euphorbia radians</h1>
<p>Euphorbia radians, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
