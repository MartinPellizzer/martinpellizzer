                    <h1>Epiclinastrum hirsutum</h1>
<p>Epiclinastrum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy epilithic plant, is a rare and specialized species adapted to grow on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact, mat-like growth form with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant's leaves are small, leathery, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which provide protection against intense sunlight and desiccation. It is typically found in rocky crevices and dry, sunny habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
