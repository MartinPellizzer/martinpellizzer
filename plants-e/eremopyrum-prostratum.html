                    <h1>Eremopyrum prostratum</h1>
<p>Eremopyrum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate wild oat, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum prostratum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
