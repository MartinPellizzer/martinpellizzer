                    <h1>Eminium carsaamii</h1>
<p>Eminium carsaamii, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowering period occurs during the brief rainy season, making it a short-lived but visually striking species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eminium carsaamii is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
