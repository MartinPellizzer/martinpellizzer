                    <h1>Eucarya spicata</h1>
<p>Eucarya spicata, commonly known as the spiky eucarya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that are typically green or purple in color. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Eucarya spicata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
