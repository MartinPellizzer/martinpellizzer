                            <h1>Eutassa Rulei</h1>
<p>Eutassa rulei, scientifically known as Eutassa rulei, is a rare and intriguing plant species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. This unique flowering plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Despite its beauty, Eutassa rulei is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this species for future generations. Its survival highlights the importance of preserving biodiversity in isolated ecosystems.</p>
