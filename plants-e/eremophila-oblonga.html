                    <h1>Eremophila oblonga</h1>
<p>Eremophila oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Eremophila oblonga is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
