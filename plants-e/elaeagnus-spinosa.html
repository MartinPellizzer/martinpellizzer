<p>Elaeagnus spinosa, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas, making it a hardy and adaptable species.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus spinosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
