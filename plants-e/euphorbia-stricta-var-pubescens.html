                    <h1>Euphorbia stricta var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stricta var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters, and it blooms in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed.</p>
