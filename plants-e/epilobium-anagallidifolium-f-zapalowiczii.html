<p>Epilobium anagallidifolium f. zapalowiczii, commonly known as the Zapalowiczii form of the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is typically found in specific alpine or subalpine habitats. The leaves are narrow and often have a distinct serration pattern compared to the typical species. This form is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
