<p>Euphorbia hypoleuca, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a waxy coating, aiding in water conservation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hypoleuca is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with low precipitation.</p>
