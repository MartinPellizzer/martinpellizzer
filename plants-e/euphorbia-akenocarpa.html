<p>Euphorbia akenocarpa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, spiny, club-shaped structures called cyathia, which are modified inflorescences. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its stem and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
<p>Euphorbia akenocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
