                    <h1>Euphorbia meloformis f. falsa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia meloformis f. falsa, commonly known as the false melon euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny stem that serves as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
