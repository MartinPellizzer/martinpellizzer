                    <h1>Echinocactus jussieui var. cristatus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus jussieui var. cristatus, commonly known as the Cristate Echinocactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crown-like growth pattern, which results from the proliferation of stem tissue. The plant features thick, ribbed stems covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
