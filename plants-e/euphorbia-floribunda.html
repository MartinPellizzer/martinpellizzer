<p>Euphorbia floribunda, commonly known as the flowering spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive reddish hue when exposed to full sun.</p>
<p>Euphorbia floribunda is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
