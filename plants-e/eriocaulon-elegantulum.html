                    <h1>Eriocaulon elegantulum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon elegantulum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often hidden beneath the water surface. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its seeds are dispersed by water currents.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon elegantulum plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
