                    <h1>Euphorbia nyikae var. nyikae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nyikae var. nyikae, commonly known as the Nyika euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Nyika Plateau in Malawi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
