<p>Elaeagnus incana, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus incana is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in poor soils.</p>
