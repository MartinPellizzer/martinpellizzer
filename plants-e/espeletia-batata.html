<p>Espeletia batata, commonly known as the batata espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant is known for its rosette-like growth habit, with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to high-altitude, arid environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>Espeletia batata is often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems, where it plays a role in local biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>
