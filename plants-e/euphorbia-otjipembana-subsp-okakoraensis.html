<p>Euphorbia otjipembana subsp.</p>
<p>okakoraensis, commonly known as the Okakoraena euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Namibia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
