                    <h1>Equisetum funstonii f. nudum</h1>
<p>Equisetum funstonii f. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a rare fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, featuring instead a jointed, segmented stem covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its primitive morphology, resembling ancient plant forms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
