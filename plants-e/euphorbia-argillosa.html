                    <h1>Euphorbia argillosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia argillosa, commonly known as the clay euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia argillosa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
