                    <h1>Epigenia integerrima</h1>
<p>Epigenia integerrima, commonly known as the golden torch or flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epigenia integerrima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
