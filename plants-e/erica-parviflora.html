                    <h1>Erica parviflora</h1>
<p>Erica parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica parviflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardiness.</p>
