<p>Echinopsis obrepanda subsp.</p>
<p>tapecuana, commonly known as the Tapecuana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
