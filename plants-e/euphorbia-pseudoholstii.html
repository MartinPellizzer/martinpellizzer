                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudoholstii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudoholstii, commonly known as the Holst's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pseudoholstii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
