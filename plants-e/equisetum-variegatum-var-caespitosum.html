                    <h1>Equisetum variegatum var. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum variegatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green with a slight reddish tint. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
