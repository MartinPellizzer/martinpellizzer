                    <h1>Euphorbia fortissima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fortissima, commonly known as the hardy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, care should be taken when handling the plant.</p>
