<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Ephedra pedunculata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems and reduce transpiration.</p>
