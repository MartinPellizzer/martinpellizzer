<p>Escobaria sandbergii, commonly known as Sandberg's liveforever, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is typically found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Escobaria sandbergii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
