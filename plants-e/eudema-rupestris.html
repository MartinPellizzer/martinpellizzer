                    <h1>Eudema rupestris</h1>
<p>Eudema rupestris, commonly known as the rock eudema, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Eudema rupestris is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in well-drained soils.</p>
