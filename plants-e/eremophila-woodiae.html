<p>Eremophila woodiae, commonly known as the Wood's emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for dryland gardens.</p>
<p>Eremophila woodiae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping.</p>
