                            <h1>Eugenia Mutabilis</h1>
<p>Purple beautyberry, scientifically known as Eugenia mutabilis, is a strikingly colorful shrub native to the southeastern United States. This plant is renowned for its vibrant, almost otherworldly purple berries that appear in late summer and persist through the winter. Despite its name, the flowers of the purple beautyberry are small and inconspicuous, often overlooked in favor of its showy fruit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is a favorite among birds and other wildlife. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a standout addition to native gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
