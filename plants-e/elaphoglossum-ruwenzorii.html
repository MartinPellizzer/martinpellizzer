                    <h1>Elaphoglossum ruwenzorii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum ruwenzorii, commonly known as the Ruwenzori holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctively holly-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum ruwenzorii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
