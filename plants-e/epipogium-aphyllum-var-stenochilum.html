                    <h1>Epipogium aphyllum var. stenochilum</h1>
<p>Epipogium aphyllum var. stenochilum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ghost orchid, is a rare and mycorrhizal orchid that lacks visible leaves and chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient acquisition, making it a unique example of myco-heterotrophy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip that sets it apart from other epipogium species. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest floors in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
