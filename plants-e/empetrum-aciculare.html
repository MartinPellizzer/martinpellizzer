                    <h1>Empetrum aciculare</h1>
<p>Empetrum aciculare, commonly known as snowberry or dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in harsh environments with poor soil and full sun exposure, making it a hardy species adapted to extreme climates.</p>
<p>Empetrum aciculare plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
