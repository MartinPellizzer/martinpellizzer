                    <h1>Euphorbia rhytisperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rhytisperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can be irritating, it requires careful handling.</p>
