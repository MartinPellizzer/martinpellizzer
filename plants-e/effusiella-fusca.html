<p>Effusiella fusca, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Effusiella fusca is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
