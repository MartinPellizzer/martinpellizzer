                    <h1>Erica dichromata</h1>
<p>Erica dichromata, commonly known as the two-colored heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms.</p>
<p>Erica dichromata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
