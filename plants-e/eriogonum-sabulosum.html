<p>Eriogonum sabulosum, commonly known as the sandburs or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of spiny, bur-like fruits. Its root system is adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eriogonum sabulosum is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a characteristic species of coastal sage scrub and desert scrub habitats.</p>
