                    <h1>Euphorbia dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dasycarpa, commonly known as the thick-shelled spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dasycarpa is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
