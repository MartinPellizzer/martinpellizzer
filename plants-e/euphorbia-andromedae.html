<p>Euphorbia andromedae, commonly known as the Andromeda spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
