                    <h1>Euphorbia sericocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sericocarpa, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
