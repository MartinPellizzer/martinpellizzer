<p>Ephedra minor, commonly known as the small ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Ephedra minor is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems.</p>
