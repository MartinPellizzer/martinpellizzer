                    <h1>Echinolobium alpinum</h1>
<p>Echinolobium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine echinolobium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Echinolobium alpinum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
