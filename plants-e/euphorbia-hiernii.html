                    <h1>Euphorbia hiernii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hiernii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may be spiny, contributing to its defensive adaptations.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hiernii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
