<p>Eragrostis whitneyi, commonly known as Whitney's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Whitney's lovegrass is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
