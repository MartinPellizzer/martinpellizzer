                    <h1>Euphorbia pilosa var. cornigera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilosa var. cornigera, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
