<p>Encelia virginiensis subsp.</p>
<p>actoni, commonly known as the coastal yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</p>
<p>The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a characteristic component of coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
