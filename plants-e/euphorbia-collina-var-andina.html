<p>Euphorbia collina var. andina, commonly known as the Andean spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
