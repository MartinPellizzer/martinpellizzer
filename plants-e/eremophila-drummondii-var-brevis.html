                    <h1>Eremophila drummondii var. brevis</h1>
<p>Eremophila drummondii var. brevis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pink to red tubular flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions.</p>
