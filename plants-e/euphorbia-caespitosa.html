                    <h1>Euphorbia caespitosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Euphorbia caespitosa is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
