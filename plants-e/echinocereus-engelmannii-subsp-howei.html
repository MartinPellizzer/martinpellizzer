<p>Echinocereus engelmannii subsp.</p>
<p>howei, commonly known as the Howei prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and bats. Its fruit, a fleshy pear-shaped structure, is edible and contains a high concentration of sugars and acids.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
