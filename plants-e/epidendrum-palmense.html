<p>Epidendrum palmense, commonly known as the Palmleaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, often resembling a palm frond. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
