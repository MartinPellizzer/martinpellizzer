                            <h1>Erica Glomerata</h1>
<p>Erica glomerata, commonly known as the heather or dwarf heather, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. With its dense, compact growth and clusters of small, fragrant flowers, it adds both beauty and resilience to any garden setting. This plant is particularly valued for its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions and low maintenance requirements. Erica glomerata is not only an ornamental plant but also plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
