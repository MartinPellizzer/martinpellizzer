                    <h1>Euphorbia reflexa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among many euphorbias. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils or in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Euphorbia reflexa is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
