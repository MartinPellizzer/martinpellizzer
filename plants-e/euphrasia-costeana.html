                    <h1>Euphrasia costeana</h1>
<p>Euphrasia costeana, commonly known as the coastal eyebright, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphrasia costeana is often found in dune ecosystems and is considered an indicator species for coastal habitats.</p>
