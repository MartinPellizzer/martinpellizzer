<p>Eleocharis bonariensis, commonly known as the Brazilian flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Eleocharis bonariensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
