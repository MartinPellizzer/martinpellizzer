<p>Epidendrum dendromacroophorum, commonly known as the tree epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Epidendrum dendromacroophorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth.</p>
