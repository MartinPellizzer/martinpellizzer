<p>Epipactis latifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red spots. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This orchid is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
