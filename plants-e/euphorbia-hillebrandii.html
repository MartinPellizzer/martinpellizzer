<p>Euphorbia hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
