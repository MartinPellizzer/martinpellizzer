                    <h1>Erica flagellaris</h1>
<p>Erica flagellaris, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Erica flagellaris plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
