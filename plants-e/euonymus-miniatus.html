                    <h1>Euonymus miniatus</h1>
<p>Euonymus miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Euonymus miniatus is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
