                    <h1>Euphoria setosa</h1>
<p>Euphoria setosa, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy, sticky coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which further aid in water conservation.</p>
<p>Euphoria setosa is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
