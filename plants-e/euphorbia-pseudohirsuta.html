<p>Euphorbia pseudohirsuta, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pseudohirsuta is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
