<p>Enneapogon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy muhly, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Enneapogon pubescens plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals, through its flowering and seed production.</p>
