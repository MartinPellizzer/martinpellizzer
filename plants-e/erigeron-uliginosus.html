                    <h1>Erigeron uliginosus</h1>
<p>Erigeron uliginosus, commonly known as swamp fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often disturbed soils, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disc florets. It blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Swamp fleabane is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide ecological benefits.</p>
