                    <h1>Ectasis demissa</h1>
<p>Ectasis demissa, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It lacks true leaves and instead has whorled clusters of small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>Ectasis demissa is a carnivorous plant that relies on its specialized trapping mechanism for nutrient acquisition.</p>
