                    <h1>Elaphoglossum petiolatum var. minus</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum petiolatum var. minus, commonly known as the small-stemmed holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, translucent indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a valuable species for studying fern biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
