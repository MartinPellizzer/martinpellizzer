                    <h1>Equisetum campanulatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum campanulatum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant is typically found in moist, often calcareous soils in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>Equisetum campanulatum is often considered a primitive plant due to its lack of true leaves and its retention of primitive vascular structures.</p>
