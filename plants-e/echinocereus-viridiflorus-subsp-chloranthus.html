<p>Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>chloranthus, commonly known as the green-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of bright green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
