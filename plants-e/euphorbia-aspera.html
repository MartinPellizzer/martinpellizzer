                    <h1>Euphorbia aspera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia aspera, commonly known as the rough spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care.</p>
<p>Euphorbia aspera is often used in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxic properties.</p>
