<p>Elymus farctus subsp.</p>
<p>rechingeri, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its robust growth and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble needles, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
