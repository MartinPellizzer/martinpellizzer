                    <h1>Erica schumannii</h1>
<p>Erica schumannii, commonly known as the Schumacher's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact form and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help it to retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica schumannii is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
