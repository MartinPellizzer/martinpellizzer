                    <h1>Ecbolium debile</h1>
<p>Ecbolium debile, commonly known as the weak ecbolium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Ecbolium debile is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
