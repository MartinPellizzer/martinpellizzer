<p>Echinopsis maximiliana subsp.</p>
<p>westii, commonly known as the Western Moon Cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem covered in white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking night-blooming flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening after sunset. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other Echinopsis species but is distinguished by its unique floral characteristics and growth habits.</p>
