                    <h1>Eleocharis starczenkoae</h1>
<p>Eleocharis starczenkoae, commonly known as the Starczenko sedge, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in water-saturated soils and is often found in marshy or seasonally flooded areas. Its morphology is adapted to its aquatic environment, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
