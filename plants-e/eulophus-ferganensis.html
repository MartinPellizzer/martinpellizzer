                    <h1>Eulophus ferganensis</h1>
<p>Eulophus ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Tephritidae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Asia, particularly the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan. The plant associated with this species is the wild carrot, Daucus carota, which serves as its primary host. Eulophus ferganensis feeds on the leaves and flowers of the host plant, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and herbivory.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in entomology due to its specific host plant relationship and geographic distribution.</p>
