<p>Eriosyce pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>calderana, commonly known as the Caldeana rock cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
