<p>Eliokarmos pruinosus, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its scientific name reflects its sticky texture, with "pruinosus" referring to the waxy, glandular coating on its surfaces.</p>
<p>Eliokarmos pruinosus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
