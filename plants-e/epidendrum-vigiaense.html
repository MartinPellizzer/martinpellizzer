                    <h1>Epidendrum vigiaense</h1>
<p>Epidendrum vigiaense, commonly known as the Vigia orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum vigiaense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
