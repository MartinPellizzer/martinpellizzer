                    <h1>Euphorbia papillata var. laevicaulis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia papillata var. laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
