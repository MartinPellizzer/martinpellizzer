                    <h1>Euphorbia culminicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia culminicola, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
