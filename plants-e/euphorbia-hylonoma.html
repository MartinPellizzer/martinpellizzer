<p>Euphorbia hylonoma, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hylonoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
