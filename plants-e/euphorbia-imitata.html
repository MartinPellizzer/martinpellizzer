                    <h1>Euphorbia imitata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia imitata, commonly known as the mimic euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
