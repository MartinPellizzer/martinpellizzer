                    <h1>Erodium laciniatum var. involucratum</h1>
<p>Erodium laciniatum var. involucratum, commonly known as the clustered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a puffy, woolly structure called an involucre, which aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and habitat restoration.</p>
