                    <h1>Euphorbia pilosa var. illirica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilosa var. illirica, commonly known as the Illyrian spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in short, spiny hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters surrounded by leaf-like structures. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
