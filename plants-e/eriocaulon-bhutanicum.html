<p>Eriocaulon bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese spikegrass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the margins of slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its tiny, clustered inflorescences produce small, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
