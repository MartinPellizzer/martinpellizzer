<p>Evaiezoa biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in pairs, hence its scientific name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Evaiezoa biflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
