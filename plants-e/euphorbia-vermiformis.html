                    <h1>Euphorbia vermiformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vermiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
