                    <h1>Encephalartos miquelii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
