                    <h1>Euphorbia vahliana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vahliana, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually spiny and alternate along the stem, providing additional protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vahliana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
