                    <h1>Echinothamnus</h1>
<p>Echinothamnus, commonly known as the coastal wrens, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal regions of southern Australia, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. Echinothamnus species are adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators.</p>
