<p>Epilobium nerterioides var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pinkish-red petals, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
