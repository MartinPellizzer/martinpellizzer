                    <h1>Echinopsis glauca</h1>
<p>Echinopsis glauca, commonly known as the blue moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers during the warmer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Echinopsis glauca is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
