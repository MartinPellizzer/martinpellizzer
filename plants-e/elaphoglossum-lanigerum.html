                    <h1>Elaphoglossum lanigerum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum lanigerum, commonly known as the silky hawksbeard, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to their hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum lanigerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
