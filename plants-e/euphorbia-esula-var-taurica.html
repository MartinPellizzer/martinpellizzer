                    <h1>Euphorbia esula var. taurica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia esula var. taurica, commonly known as the taurica spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, berry-like structures called cyathia, which contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red perianth. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
