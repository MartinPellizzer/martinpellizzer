<p>Euphorbia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia umbrosa is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
