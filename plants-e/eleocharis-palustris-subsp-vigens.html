<p>Eleocharis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>vigens, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale brown flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
