                    <h1>Ericoides flexicaule</h1>
<p>Ericoides flexicaule, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides flexicaule thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
