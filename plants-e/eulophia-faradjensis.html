<p>Eulophia faradjensis, commonly known as the Faradj's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and linear leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
