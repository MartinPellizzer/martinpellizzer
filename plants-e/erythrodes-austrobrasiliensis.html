                    <h1>Erythrodes austrobrasiliensis</h1>
<p>Erythrodes austrobrasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian redwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub characterized by its deep red bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is now found in very limited areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
