                    <h1>Euphorbia podocarpifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia podocarpifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia podocarpifolia is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
