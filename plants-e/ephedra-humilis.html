                    <h1>Ephedra humilis</h1>
<p>Ephedra humilis, commonly known as the low ephedra, is a small shrub native to arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are usually reduced or absent. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra humilis is a member of the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the gymnosperms.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to its classification as a controlled substance in many countries due to its psychoactive properties.</p>
