                            <h1>Epilobium Paniculatum Var. Tracyi</h1>
<p>Tracy's willowherb, scientifically known as Epilobium paniculatum var. tracyi, is a rare and striking plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its unique foliage and floral structure, making it a standout in its ecological niche. Found primarily in moist, sunny habitats such as streambanks and meadows, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tracy's willowherb is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
