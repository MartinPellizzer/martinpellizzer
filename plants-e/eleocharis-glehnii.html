                    <h1>Eleocharis glehnii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis glehnii, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis glehnii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
