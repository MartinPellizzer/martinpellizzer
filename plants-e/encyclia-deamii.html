<p>Encyclia deamii, commonly known as the Deamâ€™s spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance with long, thin petals and a prominent, recurved lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Encyclia deamii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
