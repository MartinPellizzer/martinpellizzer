                    <h1>Eriocaulon tenuifolium f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon tenuifolium f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous flatleaf sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This particular form is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive trait where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant reproduction and adaptation.</p>
