<p>Euphorbia deltobracteata, commonly known as the delta bract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
