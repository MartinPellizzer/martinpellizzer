<p>Elaphoglossum erinaceum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in small, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum erinaceum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
