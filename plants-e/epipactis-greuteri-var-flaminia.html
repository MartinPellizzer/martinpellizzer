                    <h1>Epipactis greuteri var. flaminia</h1>
<p>Epipactis greuteri var. flaminia, commonly known as the Flaminian helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It has a short flowering period in late spring and is pollinated by flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
