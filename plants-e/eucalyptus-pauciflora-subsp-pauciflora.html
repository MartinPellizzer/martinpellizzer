<p>Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflora, commonly known as the snow gum, is a hardy evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, revealing a pale greenish-white underlayer.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
