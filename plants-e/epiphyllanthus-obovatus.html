                    <h1>Epiphyllanthus obovatus</h1>
<p>Epiphyllanthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate epiphyllanthus, is a rare and intriguing plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, ovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
