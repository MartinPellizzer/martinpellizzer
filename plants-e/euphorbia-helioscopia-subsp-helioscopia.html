<p>Euphorbia helioscopia subsp.</p>
<p>helioscopia, commonly known as sun spurge, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features a sprawling stem with opposite, oblanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is considered somewhat toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
