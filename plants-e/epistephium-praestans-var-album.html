                    <h1>Epistephium praestans var. album</h1>
<p>Epistephium praestans var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered epistephium, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful cultivation, as it is sensitive to overwatering and prefers well-draining soil.</p>
