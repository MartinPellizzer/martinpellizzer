                    <h1>Euphorbia longicornuta var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia longicornuta var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, spiny stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>This hardy species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal regions.</p>
