<p>Eriophorum angustifolium subsp.</p>
<p>triste, commonly known as slender cotton-grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and fluffy, white or pale pink flower heads that resemble cotton.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The subspecies triste is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Eriophorum angustifolium.</p>
