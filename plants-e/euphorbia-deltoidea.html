                    <h1>Euphorbia deltoidea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often lobed or triangular in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic latex, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
