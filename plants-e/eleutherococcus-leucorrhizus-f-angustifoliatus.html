                    <h1>Eleutherococcus leucorrhizus f. angustifoliatus</h1>
<p>Eleutherococcus leucorrhizus f. angustifoliatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Siberian ginseng, is a rare variant of the eleutherococcus genus native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of the parent species, with potential adaptogenic benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in its native range.</p>
