                    <h1>Euphorbia officinarum var. columnaris</h1>
<p>Euphorbia officinarum var. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy, greenish-white cuticle.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its ability to store water in its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
