                    <h1>Erica petraea</h1>
<p>Erica petraea, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Erica petraea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
