                    <h1>Elymus glaucus var. breviaristatus</h1>
<p>Elymus glaucus var. breviaristatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical Elymus glaucus. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
