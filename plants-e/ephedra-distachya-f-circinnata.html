                    <h1>Ephedra distachya f. circinnata</h1>
<p>Ephedra distachya f. circinnata, commonly known as the curled-stem ephedra, is a unique variant of the ephedra plant characterized by its distinct, spirally twisted stems.</p>
<p>This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its small, scale-like leaves are typically reduced to minute structures, and it produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>It is also of interest in botanical studies for its morphological adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
