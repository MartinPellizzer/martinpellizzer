<p>Ebnerella baumii, commonly known as the baumii fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically丛生 (clumped) in growth. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which is a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Ebnerella baumii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
