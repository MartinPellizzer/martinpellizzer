                    <h1>Erica capillaris var. poliotes</h1>
<p>Erica capillaris var. poliotes, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
