                    <h1>Ebnerella dioica</h1>
<p>Ebnerella dioica, commonly known as the two-flowered waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, and has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, with separate male and female flowers on different inflorescences, a characteristic of its dioecious nature. Its roots are often submerged, helping to stabilize the sediment and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Ebnerella dioica plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
