                    <h1>Euphorbia pachyrrhiza</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pachyrrhiza is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
