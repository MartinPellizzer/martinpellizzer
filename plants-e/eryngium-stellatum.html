                    <h1>Eryngium stellatum</h1>
<p>Eryngium stellatum, commonly known as the star thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a star, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Eryngium stellatum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
