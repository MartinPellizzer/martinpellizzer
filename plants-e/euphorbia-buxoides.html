                    <h1>Euphorbia buxoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia buxoides, commonly known as the dwarf African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care.</p>
