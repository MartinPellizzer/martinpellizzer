<p>Echeveria ingens, commonly known as the giant echeveria, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter, often with a bluish or grayish hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant purple or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its size and dramatic appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
