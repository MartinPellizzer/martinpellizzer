                    <h1>Euphorbia ledienii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ledienii, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a succulent plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare succulents.</p>
