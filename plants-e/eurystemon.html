                    <h1>Eurystemon</h1>
<p>Eurystemon, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Eurystemon species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
