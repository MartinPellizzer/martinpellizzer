                    <h1>Ecballium elaterium var. monoicum</h1>
<p>Ecballium elaterium var. monoicum, commonly known as the one-seeded cucumber, is a variant of the common cocklebur.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, one-seeded fruit that is enclosed in a spiky, ribbed husk. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fruit contains a single, large seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible pericarp.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to disperse seeds through mechanical means, as the husk can explosively release the seed when touched.</p>
