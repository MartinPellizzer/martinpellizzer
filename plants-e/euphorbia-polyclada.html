<p>Euphorbia polyclada, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Euphorbia polyclada is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
