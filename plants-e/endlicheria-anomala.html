                    <h1>Endlicheria anomala</h1>
<p>Endlicheria anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a spongy, white tissue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in the canopy of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
