<p>Eremostachys boissieriana, commonly known as the desert gentian, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and bluish-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eremostachys boissieriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>
