                    <h1>Epithecia coriacea</h1>
<p>Epithecia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skin lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery thallus that gives it a coriaceous texture, hence its scientific name. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It is a secondary symbiont, formed by a mutualistic relationship between a green alga and a fungus.</p>
<p>Its morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
