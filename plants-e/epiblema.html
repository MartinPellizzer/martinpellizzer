                    <h1>Epiblema</h1>
<p>Epiblema, commonly known as the root hair cell layer, is a specialized tissue found in the root epidermis of many vascular plants.</p>
<p>It consists of elongated, unicellular structures that protrude from the root surface, enhancing the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. These root hairs are primarily composed of cell walls rich in cellulose and pectin, which provide structural support and facilitate water uptake. The epiblema plays a crucial role in the plant's interaction with its environment, particularly in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its development is influenced by environmental factors such as soil moisture and nutrient availability.</p>
