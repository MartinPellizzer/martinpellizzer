<p>Elaphoglossum wettsteinii var. palustre, commonly known as the swamp holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to wet, shaded environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, leathery, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and preference for consistently damp conditions.</p>
