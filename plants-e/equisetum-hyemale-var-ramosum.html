                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. ramosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. ramosum, commonly known as the Scouring Rush, is a primitive fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stiff, needle-like leaves and a tall, spore-bearing stem that emerges in early spring. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves and its reliance on spores for reproduction, a feature common to ancient plant lineages. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use in cleaning metal surfaces has given it the common name "Scouring Rush.".</p>
