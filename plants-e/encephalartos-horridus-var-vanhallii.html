                    <h1>Encephalartos horridus var. vanhallii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos horridus var. vanhallii, commonly known as the Van Hallâ€™s cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a short, stout trunk with a dense crown of feathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its unique morphology includes a spiky, hairy appearance on the trunk and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
