<p>Eriophorum vaginatum subsp.</p>
<p>spissum, commonly known as tussock cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the production of fluffy, white seed heads that are typical of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant forms tussocks, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually short and stiff, and the flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of tundra and wetland ecosystems.</p>
