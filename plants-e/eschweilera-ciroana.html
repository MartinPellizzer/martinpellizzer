<p>Eschweilera ciroana, commonly known as the Ciroana wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eschweilera ciroana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
