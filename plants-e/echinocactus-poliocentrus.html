<p>Echinocactus poliocentrus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
