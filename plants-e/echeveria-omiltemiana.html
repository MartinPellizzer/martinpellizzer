<p>Echeveria omiltemiana, commonly known as the Blue Elf or Blue Moon, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branching stems with showy violet or blue-pink flowers during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
