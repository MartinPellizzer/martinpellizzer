                    <h1>Equisetum arboreum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arboreum, commonly known as the tree fern, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the order Equisetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that is often covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations at the top of the stem. Equisetum arboreum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
