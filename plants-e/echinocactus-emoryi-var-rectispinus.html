                    <h1>Echinocactus emoryi var. rectispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus emoryi var. rectispinus, commonly known as the Emory's hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
