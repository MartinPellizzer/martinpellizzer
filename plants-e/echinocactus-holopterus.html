<p>Echinocactus holopterus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny exterior, which provides protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that allows it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the plant during the growing season.</p>
<p>Echinocactus holopterus is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
