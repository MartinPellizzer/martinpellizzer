                    <h1>Eleocharis glabella</h1>
<p>Eleocharis glabella, commonly known as the flat-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that typically bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis glabella plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
