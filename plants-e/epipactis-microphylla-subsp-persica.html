<p>Epipactis microphylla subsp.</p>
<p>persica, commonly known as the Persian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces a showy inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
