                    <h1>Erigeron alpinus var. atticus</h1>
<p>Erigeron alpinus var. atticus, commonly known as the Alpine Blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base, supporting a profusion of small, daisy-like flowers. The flowers consist of white ray florets surrounding a central cluster of yellow disk florets, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
