<p>Eriogonum depauperatum, commonly known as the barrenleaf buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sparse foliage and showy, clustered pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eriogonum depauperatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common sight in desert and foothill ecosystems.</p>
