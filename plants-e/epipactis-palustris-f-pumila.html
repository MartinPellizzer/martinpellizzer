<p>Epipactis palustris f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish leaves and its unique, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. This orchid thrives in peat bogs and other moist, acidic environments, often growing close to the ground. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
