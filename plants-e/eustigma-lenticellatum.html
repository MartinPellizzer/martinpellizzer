                    <h1>Eustigma lenticellatum</h1>
<p>Eustigma lenticellatum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lichen, is a unique fungal-lichen composite that exhibits specific botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives on bark and stone surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to perform photosynthesis. Its surface is typically smooth and lacks distinct leaf-like structures, distinguishing it from typical vascular plants.</p>
<p>The lichen's ability to retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions makes it an important indicator species in ecological studies.</p>
