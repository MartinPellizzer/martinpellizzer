                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. edulis</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. edulis, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and widely introduced to other regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in many ecosystems.</p>
<p>The seeds are small, wind-dispersed, and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
