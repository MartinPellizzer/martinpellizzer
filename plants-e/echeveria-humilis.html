                    <h1>Echeveria humilis</h1>
<p>Echeveria humilis, commonly known as the Mexican snowflake, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant color.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
