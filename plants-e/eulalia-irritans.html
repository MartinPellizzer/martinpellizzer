<p>Eulalia irritans, commonly known as the irritant grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can produce a strong, irritating odor. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
<p>The irritant properties of the plant are attributed to the presence of certain volatile compounds in its tissues.</p>
