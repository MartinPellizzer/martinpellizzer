<p>Echinopsis oxygona f. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The variety 'grandiflora' is distinguished by its particularly large and abundant blooms compared to the typical species.</p>
