                    <h1>Echeveria rusbyi</h1>
<p>Echeveria rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces showy, violet-pink flowers on tall stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its compact form.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
