                    <h1>Euphorbia deflexa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia deflexa, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation, requiring caution when handling.</p>
