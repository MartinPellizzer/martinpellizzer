                    <h1>Eleocharis acicularis var. elongata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis acicularis var. elongata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow spikes of small, greenish flowers that emerge from dense clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense vegetation in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears numerous tiny, spikelet-like flower clusters.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
