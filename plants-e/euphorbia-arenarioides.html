                    <h1>Euphorbia arenarioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arenarioides, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and gray-green, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative succulent.</p>
