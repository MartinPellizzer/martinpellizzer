                    <h1>Enchysia secunda</h1>
<p>Enchysia secunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal environments.</p>
<p>Enchysia secunda plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
