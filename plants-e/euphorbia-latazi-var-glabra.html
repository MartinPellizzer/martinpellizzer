<p>Euphorbia latazi var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow花朵, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it is known for its ability to form a dense, rounded shape.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in rock gardens and xeriscapes for its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
