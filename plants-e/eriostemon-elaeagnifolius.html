                    <h1>Eriostemon elaeagnifolius</h1>
<p>Eriostemon elaeagnifolius, commonly known as silverleaf eriostemon, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the stems are often woody and branched.</p>
<p>Eriostemon elaeagnifolius is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with limited rainfall.</p>
