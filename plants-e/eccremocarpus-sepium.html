<p>Eccremocarpus sepium, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in salty, coastal environments.</p>
<p>Eccremocarpus sepium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types.</p>
