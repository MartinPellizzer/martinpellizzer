                            <h1>Elatinoides Commutata</h1>
<p>Common evening primrose, scientifically known as Elatinoides commutata, is a hardy annual plant native to the arid regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, and its ability to withstand drought conditions. Its common name reflects the timing of its bloom, which occurs during the late afternoon and into the night. Despite its modest appearance, the evening primrose plays an important role in supporting nocturnal pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
