                    <h1>Echinops schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Echinops schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, which give it its genus name "Echinops.". The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, appearing in early spring before the seed heads develop.</p>
<p>Echinops schweinfurthii is adapted to survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
