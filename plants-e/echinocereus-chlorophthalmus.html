                    <h1>Echinocereus chlorophthalmus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus chlorophthalmus, commonly known as the pale-eyed hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and small, pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in sandy soils. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
