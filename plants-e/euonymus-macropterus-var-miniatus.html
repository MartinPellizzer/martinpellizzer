                    <h1>Euonymus macropterus var. miniatus</h1>
<p>Euonymus macropterus var. miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf burning bush, is a compact shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
