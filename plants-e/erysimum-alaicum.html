The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erysimum alaicum is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
