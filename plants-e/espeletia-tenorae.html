                    <h1>Espeletia tenorae</h1>
<p>Espeletia tenorae, commonly known as the "Páramo Giant," is a striking plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, rosette-forming leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps it retain moisture in the cold, high-altitude environment. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Espeletia tenorae is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand strong winds and intense UV radiation.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the biodiversity of the Andean region.</p>
