<p>Elachopappus, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plants typically have slender stems and are often found in dry, rocky habitats across the western United States. Elachopappus species are known for their delicate, feathery pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of their seeds.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in supporting local pollinators and contribute to the ecological diversity of arid landscapes.</p>
