                    <h1>Exadenus alatus</h1>
<p>Exadenus alatus, commonly known as the winged milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, contains cardiac glycosides.</p>
<p>Exadenus alatus plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for specialized insects like the pipevine swallowtail butterfly.</p>
