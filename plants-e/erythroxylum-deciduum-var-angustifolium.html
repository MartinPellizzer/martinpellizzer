                    <h1>Erythroxylum deciduum var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum deciduum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wild coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding leaves seasonally in response to environmental conditions. The plant features lanceolate, narrow leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside, which is a notable botanical trait. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This species is closely related to other coca species and has been of interest for both its ecological role and traditional uses.</p>
