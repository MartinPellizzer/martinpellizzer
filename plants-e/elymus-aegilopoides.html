<p>Elymus aegilopoides, commonly known as the wheatgrass or wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage, often forming clumps or tussocks. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, with lemmas and paleas that are often hairy. Its fibrous roots make it a hardy species capable of thriving in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Elymus aegilopoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife.</p>
