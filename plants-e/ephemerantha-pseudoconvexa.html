<p>Ephemerantha pseudoconvexa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded habitats, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the wetlands and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
