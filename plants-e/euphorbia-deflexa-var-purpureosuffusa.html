<p>Euphorbia deflexa var. purpureosuffusa, commonly known as the purple-veined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with purple or red hues. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
