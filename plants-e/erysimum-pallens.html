<p>Erysimum pallens, commonly known as the pale wallflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, four-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Erysimum pallens is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
