                    <h1>Eichhornia martiusiana</h1>
<p>Eichhornia martiusiana, commonly known as the red water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a waxy layer, which helps it float on water surfaces. The plant produces striking purple or pink flowers with showy bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can rapidly spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
