<p>Eugenia malaccensis f. cericarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited eugenia, is a rare and unique variant of the Eugenia genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, red or purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
