                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. malabaricum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar horse-tail, is a species of horsetail that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Its leaves are reduced to small, sterile structures called bracts.</p>
<p>This variety is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
