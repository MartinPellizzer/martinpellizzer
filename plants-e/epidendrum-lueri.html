                    <h1>Epidendrum lueri</h1>
<p>Epidendrum lueri, commonly known as the Luer's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in racemes. Its leaves are elongated and革质, providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Epidendrum lueri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
