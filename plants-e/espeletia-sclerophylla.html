<p>Espeletia sclerophylla, commonly known as the Santa Marta pineapple plant, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in the dry season. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Espeletia sclerophylla is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its ecological importance in cloud forest ecosystems.</p>
