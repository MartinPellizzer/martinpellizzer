<p>Eucalyptus scias subsp.</p>
<p>apoda, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits.</p>
