<p>Epilobium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are typically tubular and have five stamens, which are characteristic of the Onagraceae family.</p>
<p>Epilobium pauciflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
