                    <h1>Euphorbia halophila</h1>
<p>Euphorbia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, which further minimize water evaporation.</p>
<p>Euphorbia halophila is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
