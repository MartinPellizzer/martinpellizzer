<p>Eleocharis obtusa var. jejuna, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse via water or wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
