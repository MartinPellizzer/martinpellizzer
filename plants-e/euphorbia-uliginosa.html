                    <h1>Euphorbia uliginosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in a milky, toxic sap. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia uliginosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
