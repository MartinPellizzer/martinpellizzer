<p>Escobaria alversonii, commonly known as Alverson's liveforever, is a low-growing succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
