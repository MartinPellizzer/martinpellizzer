<p>Eleocharis mexicana, commonly known as Mexican spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Eleocharis mexicana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
