                    <h1>Elionurus tripsacoides subvar. brevidentatus</h1>
<p>Elionurus tripsacoides subvar. brevidentatus, commonly known as the short-toothed wild barley, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, contributing to its spread across various habitats.</p>
<p>This subvariety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
