<p>Elaeagnus obovata, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its opposite, obovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by reddish-brown, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus obovata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
