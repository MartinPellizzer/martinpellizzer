                    <h1>Euphorbia porcata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia porcata, commonly known as the "pork plant," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, spiky leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
