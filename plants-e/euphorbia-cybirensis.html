                    <h1>Euphorbia cybirensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cybirensis, commonly known as the Cybirensis spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, short stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cybirensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
