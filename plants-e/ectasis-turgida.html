                    <h1>Ectasis turgida</h1>
<p>Ectasis turgida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like sacs, which are used to capture prey through a rapid closing mechanism. These bladders are typically green or reddish in color and can inflate to several times their original size.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, where it can efficiently capture and digest its prey.</p>
