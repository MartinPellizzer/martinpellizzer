                    <h1>Echinaria pumila</h1>
<p>Echinaria pumila, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and a deep root system for accessing moisture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Echinaria pumila plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
