                            <h1>Equisetum Arvense Var. Boreale</h1>
<p>Field horsetail, scientifically known as Equisetum arvense var. boreale, is a resilient plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments. It is characterized by its distinctive whorls of needle-like leaves and its ability to reproduce through spores rather than seeds. This ancient plant has existed for over 300 million years and is often found in disturbed soils near roadsides or in wetlands. Its tall, slender stems can reach heights of up to two meters, making it a striking presence in the landscape. Despite its primitive appearance, field horsetail plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms.</p>
