The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its adaptability and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
