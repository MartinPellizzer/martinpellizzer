<p>Echinocactus smithii, commonly known as the Smith's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny, tuberculate areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus smithii is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
