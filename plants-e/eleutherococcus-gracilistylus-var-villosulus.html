                    <h1>Eleutherococcus gracilistylus var. villosulus</h1>
<p>Eleutherococcus gracilistylus var. villosulus, commonly known as the hairy-styled eleutherococcus, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the eleutherococcus genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in parts of China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red berries, typical of the genus.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution.</p>
