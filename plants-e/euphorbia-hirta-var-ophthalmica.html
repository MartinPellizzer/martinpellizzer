<p>Euphorbia hirta var. ophthalmica, commonly known as the stinging nettle euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant contains latex-like sap that can cause a burning sensation when touched, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential irritant.</p>
