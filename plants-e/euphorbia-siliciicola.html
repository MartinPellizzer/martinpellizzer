                    <h1>Euphorbia siliciicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia siliciicola, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia siliciicola is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
