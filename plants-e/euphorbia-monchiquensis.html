<p>Euphorbia monchiquensis, commonly known as the Monchique spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia monchiquensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
