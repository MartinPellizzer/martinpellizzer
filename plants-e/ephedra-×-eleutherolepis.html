                    <h1>Ephedra × eleutherolepis</h1>
<p>Ephedra × eleutherolepis, commonly known as the hybrid Ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential for abuse and toxicity, it is now regulated in many regions.</p>
