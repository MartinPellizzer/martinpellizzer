                    <h1>Euphorbia hirsuta var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hirsuta var. subglabra, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
