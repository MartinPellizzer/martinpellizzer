                            <h1>Echinocodon Primulifolius</h1>
<p>Echinocodon coralroot, scientifically known as Echinocodon primulifolius, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family found in specific habitats across North America. This unique plant is named for its coral-like roots and its delicate, primrose-shaped leaves that give it a striking appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi that are essential to its survival. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern. Despite its subtle beauty, Echinocodon coralroot plays a vital role in its ecosystem and remains a subject of scientific interest and protection efforts.</p>
