                    <h1>Ectrosia</h1>
<p>Ectrosia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving it a ghostly appearance. Ectrosia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plants have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize new areas gradually.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
