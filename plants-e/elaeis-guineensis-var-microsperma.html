<p>Elaeis guineensis var. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller fruit size and reduced seed mass compared to the standard Elaeis guineensis. The plant produces an oil-rich fruit, which is used for both culinary and industrial purposes. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size, it is often cultivated in smaller spaces and is valued for its productivity in limited areas.</p>
