<p>Echinocactus ellemeetii, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, bristle-like spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
