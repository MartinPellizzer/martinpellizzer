                    <h1>Echites succulentus</h1>
<p>Echites succulentus, commonly known as the desert star or star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with distinctive star-shaped spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, allowing it to store water efficiently in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echites succulentus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
