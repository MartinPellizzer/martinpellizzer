                    <h1>Echyrospermum</h1>
<p>Echyrospermum, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their silver or gray-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are typically yellow with a central disk, and they produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Echyrospermum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
