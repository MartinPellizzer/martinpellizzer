                    <h1>Euphorbia litticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia litticola, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping.</p>
