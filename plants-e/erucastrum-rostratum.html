<p>Erucastrum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Erucastrum rostratum is an example of a carnivorous plant that has adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
