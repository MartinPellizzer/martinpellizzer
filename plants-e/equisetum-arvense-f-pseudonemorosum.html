<p>Equisetum arvense f. pseudonemorosum, commonly known as the false fern, is a variant of the field horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
