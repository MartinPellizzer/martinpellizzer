                    <h1>Euphorbia cuneneana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cuneneana, commonly known as the Cunene spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
