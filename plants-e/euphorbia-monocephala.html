                    <h1>Euphorbia monocephala</h1>
<p>Euphorbia monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are covered in a thick layer of pale green to grayish-white bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
