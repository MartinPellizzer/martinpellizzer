<p>Encephalartos mackenziei, commonly known as the Mackenzie cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
