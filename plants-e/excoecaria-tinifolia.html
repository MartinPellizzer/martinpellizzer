                    <h1>Excoecaria tinifolia</h1>
<p>Excoecaria tinifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive prop root system that helps stabilize the soil and allows for gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. The plant produces small, reddish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange-colored fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which reduces water loss in the humid, coastal climate.</p>
<p>Excoecaria tinifolia plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
