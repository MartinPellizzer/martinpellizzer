                    <h1>Euphorbia dispersa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dispersa, commonly known as the wandering spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to survive in dry conditions by storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dispersa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
