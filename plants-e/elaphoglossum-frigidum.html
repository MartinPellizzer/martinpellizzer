<p>Elaphoglossum frigidum, commonly known as the cold fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricately divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Elaphoglossum frigidum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
