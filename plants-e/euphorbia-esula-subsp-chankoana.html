<p>Euphorbia esula subsp.</p>
<p>chankoana, commonly known as the Chanko euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution.</p>
