                    <h1>Eragrostis rotifer</h1>
<p>Eragrostis rotifer, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Eragrostis rotifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
