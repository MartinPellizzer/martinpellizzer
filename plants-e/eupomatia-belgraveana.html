<p>Eupomatia belgraveana, commonly known as the Belgravean eupomatia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eupomatia belgraveana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
