                    <h1>Echinocactus minax</h1>
<p>Echinocactus minax, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
