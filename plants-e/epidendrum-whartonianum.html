                    <h1>Epidendrum whartonianum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum whartonianum, commonly known as the Mexican Flame Orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
