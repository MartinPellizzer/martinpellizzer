<p>Eriocaulon stupeum, commonly known as the stunted flat sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon stupeum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
