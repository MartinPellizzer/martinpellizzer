                    <h1>Euphorbia hirta var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hirta var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with fleshy, somewhat hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>
