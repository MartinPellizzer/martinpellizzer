<p>Ebnerella posseltiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, unbranched stem and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
