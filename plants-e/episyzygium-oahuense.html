<p>Episyzygium oahuense, commonly known as the Oahu sandalwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and is typically found in coastal sand dune habitats. The plant has a unique ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its wood was historically valued for its aromatic properties, though its use has been significantly reduced in modern times.</p>
