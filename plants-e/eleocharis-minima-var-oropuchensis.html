                    <h1>Eleocharis minima var. oropuchensis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis minima var. oropuchensis, commonly known as the Oropuche sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and tiny, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with high humidity and limited sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
