                    <h1>Eragrostis fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis fluviatilis, commonly known as rivergrass or river oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along rivers, streams, and lakeshores, often forming dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for grazing animals.</p>
