<p>Equisetum hyemale var. texanum, commonly known as Texas horsetail, is a perennial plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
