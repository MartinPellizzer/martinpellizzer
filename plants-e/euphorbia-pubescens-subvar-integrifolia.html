                    <h1>Euphorbia pubescens subvar. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pubescens subvar. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may be present during the growing season before shedding in winter.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
