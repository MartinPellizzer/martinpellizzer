<p>Eremostachys labiosissima, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with dense, gray-green foliage adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremostachys labiosissima is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
