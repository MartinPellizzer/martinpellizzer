<p>Eria kamlangensis, commonly known as the Kamlang orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical structure includes long, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it adapt to its natural habitat.</p>
