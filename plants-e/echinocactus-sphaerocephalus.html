<p>Echinocactus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spiny exterior provides protection from herbivores and helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus sphaerocephalus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
