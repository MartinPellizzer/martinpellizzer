                    <h1>Echinochloa oplismenoides</h1>
<p>Echinochloa oplismenoides, commonly known as foxtail millet, is an annual grass native to warm temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel venation. Its seeds are small, hard, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other millet species.</p>
