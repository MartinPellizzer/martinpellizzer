<p>Echinopsis spiniflora, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often spirals as it grows, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinopsis spiniflora is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
