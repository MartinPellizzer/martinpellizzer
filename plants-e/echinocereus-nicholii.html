                    <h1>Echinocereus nicholii</h1>
<p>Echinocereus nicholii, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiky structure. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
