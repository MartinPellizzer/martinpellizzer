<p>Eremophila oldfieldii, commonly known as Oldfield's emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water environments. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eremophila oldfieldii is often used in native gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
