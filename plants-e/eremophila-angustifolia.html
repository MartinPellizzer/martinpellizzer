<p>Eremophila angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremophila angustifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native gardens and landscaping.</p>
