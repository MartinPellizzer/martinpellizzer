                    <h1>Eleusine reniformis</h1>
<p>Eleusine reniformis, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often ribbed and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
