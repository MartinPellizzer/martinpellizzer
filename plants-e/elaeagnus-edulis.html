<p>Elaeagnus edulis, commonly known as silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-brown berries that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus edulis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil remediation and as a pioneer species in degraded areas.</p>
