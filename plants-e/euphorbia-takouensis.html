                    <h1>Euphorbia takouensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia takouensis, commonly known as the Takou spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting it to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia takouensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
