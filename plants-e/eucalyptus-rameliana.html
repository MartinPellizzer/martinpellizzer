<p>Eucalyptus rameliana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically yellow or cream in color, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus rameliana thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
