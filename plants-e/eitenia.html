<p>Eitenia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in salty conditions.</p>
<p>Eitenia plays a vital role in supporting marine and coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
