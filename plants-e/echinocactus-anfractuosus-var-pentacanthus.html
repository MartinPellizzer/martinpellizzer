                    <h1>Echinocactus anfractuosus var. pentacanthus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus anfractuosus var. pentacanthus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing cactus with a distinctive star-shaped appearance due to its ribbed, spiny structure. The plant features a short, thick stem with prominent, spiny tubercles that give it a unique and rugged appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its striking form and ability to withstand harsh desert conditions.</p>
