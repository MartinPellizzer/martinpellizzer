<p>Espeletia tillettii, commonly known as the Tiltlet's heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as p√°ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Espeletia tillettii is also noted for its ability to form clonal colonies, contributing to its resilience in mountainous regions.</p>
