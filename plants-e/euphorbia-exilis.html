<p>Euphorbia exilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or red in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
