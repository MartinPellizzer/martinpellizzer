<p>Euphorbia tanquahuete, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
