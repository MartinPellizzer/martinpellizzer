                    <h1>Echinops paradoxus</h1>
<p>Echinops paradoxus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiky seed heads that resemble a crown, which are covered in small, bristly structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinops paradoxus is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable plant for stabilizing sandy or eroded landscapes.</p>
