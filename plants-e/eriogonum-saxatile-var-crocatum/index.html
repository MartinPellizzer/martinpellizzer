                            <h1>Eriogonum Saxatile Var. Crocatum</h1>
<p>Crocodile's tail, scientifically known as Eriogonum saxatile var. crocatum, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. Its most distinctive feature is its long, curling leaves that resemble the tail of a crocodile, giving it its common name. This hardy species thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in desert environments where water is scarce. Despite its tough exterior, it produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
