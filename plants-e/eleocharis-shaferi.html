<p>Eleocharis shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis shaferi is also a food source for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
