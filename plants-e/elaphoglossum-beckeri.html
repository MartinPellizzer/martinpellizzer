<p>Elaphoglossum beckeri, commonly known as the Becker's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum beckeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
