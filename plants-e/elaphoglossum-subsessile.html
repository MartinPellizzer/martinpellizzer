                    <h1>Elaphoglossum subsessile</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum subsessile, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, characteristic of the Elaphoglossum genus. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct patterns.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability to rocky substrates makes it an important component of its ecological niche.</p>
