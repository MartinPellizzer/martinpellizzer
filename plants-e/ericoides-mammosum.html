                    <h1>Ericoides mammosum</h1>
<p>Ericoides mammosum, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is adapted to prevent soil erosion and stabilize rocky terrain.</p>
<p>Ericoides mammosum is often found in alpine meadows and is well-suited to cold, dry climates.</p>
