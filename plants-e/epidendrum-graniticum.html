                    <h1>Epidendrum graniticum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum graniticum, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, making it well-suited to its rocky, humid habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum graniticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
