                    <h1>Emex × acuta</h1>
<p>Emex × acuta, commonly known as the hybrid tumbleweed, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the production of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant's seeds are enclosed in papery, wind-dispersed pods, which contribute to its ability to spread across open landscapes. Emex × acuta thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
