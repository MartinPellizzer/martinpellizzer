<p>Erinus alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus, commonly known as the alpine erinus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
