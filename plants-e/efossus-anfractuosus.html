<p>Efossus anfractuosus, commonly known as the wrinkled fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its intricate, undulating fronds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically a deep green, with a textured surface that gives the plant its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is slow, requiring careful cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Efossus anfractuosus is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in conservation efforts.</p>
