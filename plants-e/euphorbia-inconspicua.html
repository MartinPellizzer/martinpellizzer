                    <h1>Euphorbia inconspicua</h1>
<p>Euphorbia inconspicua, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for desert landscaping.</p>
