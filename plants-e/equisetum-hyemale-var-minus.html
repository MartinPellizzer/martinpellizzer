                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. minus</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. minus, commonly known as the lesser scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called strobili, are clustered at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Equisetum hyemale, with shorter stems and a more compact growth habit.</p>
