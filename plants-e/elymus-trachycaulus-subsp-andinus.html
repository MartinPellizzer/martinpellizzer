<p>andinus, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a rough, sandpapery texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with awns that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological systems in the Andes.</p>
