                    <h1>Elephantopus arenarius</h1>
<p>Elephantopus arenarius, commonly known as the sand elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique appearance, with its swollen base and hairy foliage, makes it a striking addition to rock gardens or xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is popular among gardeners in dry climates.</p>
