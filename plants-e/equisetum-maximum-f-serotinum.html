                    <h1>Equisetum maximum f. serotinum</h1>
<p>Equisetum maximum f. serotinum, commonly known as the late spore form of the scouring rush, is a fern ally characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant produces spores in terminal cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of its primitive reproductive system. Its stems are often used for their abrasive qualities, hence the common name "scouring rush.".</p>
<p>This form is typically found in moist, acidic soils in shaded environments.</p>
