                    <h1>Eleocharis rothiana var. nuda</h1>
<p>Eleocharis rothiana var. nuda, commonly known as the naked spike rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant produces tiny, white or pale brown flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are often difficult to distinguish from the sterile spikelets. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates in aquatic environments.</p>
