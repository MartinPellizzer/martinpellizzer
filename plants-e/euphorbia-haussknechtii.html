                    <h1>Euphorbia haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's spurges, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
