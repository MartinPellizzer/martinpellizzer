<p>Echeveria hyalina, commonly known as the glassy echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure composed of fleshy, translucent leaves that range from pale green to white. The leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
