<p>Erigeron pratensis, commonly known as the meadow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall.</p>
<p>Erigeron pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and support pollinator populations.</p>
