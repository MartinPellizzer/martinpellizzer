<p>Ehrhartia, commonly known as goatgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their slender, tufted growth habit. Ehrhartia species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. They are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings due to their rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species that are of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
