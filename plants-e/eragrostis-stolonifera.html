                    <h1>Eragrostis stolonifera</h1>
<p>Eragrostis stolonifera, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf.</p>
<p>Buffalo grass is often used in drought-tolerant landscaping due to its minimal water requirements.</p>
