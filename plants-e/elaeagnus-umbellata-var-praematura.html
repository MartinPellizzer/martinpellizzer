The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen earlier than those of the typical Elaeagnus umbellata. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment.</p>
