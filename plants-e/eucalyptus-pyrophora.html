<p>Eucalyptus pyrophora, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a vibrant red or orange color beneath. The tree produces striking clusters of bright red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus pyrophora is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its base after bushfires.</p>
