<p>Eriosyce curvispina subsp.</p>
<p>mutabilis, commonly known as the variable cactus or the variable eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
