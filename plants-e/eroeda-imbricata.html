<p>Eroeda imbricata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in crevices and on cliffs, where it can withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Eroeda imbricata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its native range.</p>
