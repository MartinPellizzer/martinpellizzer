                    <h1>Euphorbia pergracilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pergracilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, green, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures, often mistaken for flowers. It has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a characteristic common among many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pergracilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
