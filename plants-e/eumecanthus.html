                    <h1>Eumecanthus</h1>
<p>Eumecanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Eumecanthus thrives in swampy, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on the roots of trees or in shallow water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
