                    <h1>Eremostachys labiosa var. subvillosa</h1>
<p>Eremostachys labiosa var. subvillosa, commonly known as the silky eremostachys, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered pink or red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
