                    <h1>Epipactis viridans var. obtusa</h1>
<p>Epipactis viridans var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is considered rare in some regions due to habitat loss.</p>
