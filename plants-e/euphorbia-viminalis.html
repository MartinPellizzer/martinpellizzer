<p>Euphorbia viminalis, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Euphorbia viminalis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
