<p>Epipactis helleborine, commonly known as the helleborine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Epipactis helleborine is known for its ability to mimic the appearance of surrounding vegetation, which helps it avoid herbivory.</p>
