                    <h1>Eriostemon buxifolius var. obovatus</h1>
<p>Eriostemon buxifolius var. obovatus, commonly known as the glossy boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its leaves are elliptical to obovate in shape, giving it a neat, boxwood-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a topiary plant due to its slow growth and tolerance of pruning.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
