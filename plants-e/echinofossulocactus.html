<p>Echinofossulocactus, commonly known as the "spiny ribbed cactus," is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Echinofossulocactus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
