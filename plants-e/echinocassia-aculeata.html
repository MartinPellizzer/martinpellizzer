                    <h1>Echinocassia aculeata</h1>
<p>Echinocassia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and prominent spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Echinocassia aculeata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures for medicinal purposes.</p>
