<p>Erysimum cheiranthoides var. aquaticum, commonly known as water wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are bright yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
