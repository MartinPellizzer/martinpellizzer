                    <h1>Espeletia alternifolia</h1>
<p>Espeletia alternifolia, commonly known as the cloud forest heather, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact, rounded growth habit, which helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are typically alternate and narrow, covered in a thick layer of fine hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Espeletia alternifolia is often found in cloud forests, where it thrives in the humid, misty conditions typical of these ecosystems.</p>
