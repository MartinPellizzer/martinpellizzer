                    <h1>Epilobium lechleri var. antarcticum</h1>
<p>Epilobium lechleri var. antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic willow, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a low-growing habit that helps it survive in high-altitude and arid regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
