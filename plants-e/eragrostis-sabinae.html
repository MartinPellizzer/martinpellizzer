                    <h1>Eragrostis sabinae</h1>
<p>Eragrostis sabinae, commonly known as the desert lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant in dry regions.</p>
