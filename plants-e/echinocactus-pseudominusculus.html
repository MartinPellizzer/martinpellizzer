                    <h1>Echinocactus pseudominusculus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus pseudominusculus, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height. Its most distinguishing feature is its dense covering of short, spiny areoles, which give it a spiky, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged exterior.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments such as greenhouses or as a potted plant.</p>
