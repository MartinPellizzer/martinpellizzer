                    <h1>Eritrichium boreale</h1>
<p>Eritrichium boreale, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which reduces water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eritrichium boreale is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common sight in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
