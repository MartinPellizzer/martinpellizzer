<p>Eritrichium debile, commonly known as the slender alpine bellflower, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Eritrichium debile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
