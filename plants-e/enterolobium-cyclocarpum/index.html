                            <h1>Enterolobium Cyclocarpum</h1>
<p>Enterolobium cyclocarpum is a striking tropical tree known for its unique pod-like fruits and feathery foliage. Native to South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas. The plant is also called the "bottle tree" due to its thick, bulbous trunk that stores water. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a sweet, edible fruit that is popular in local cuisines. This versatile plant has been used for both ornamental and practical purposes throughout its native regions.</p>
