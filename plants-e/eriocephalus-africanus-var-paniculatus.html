                    <h1>Eriocephalus africanus var. paniculatus</h1>
<p>Eriocephalus africanus var. paniculatus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It possesses small, elliptical leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, giving it its specific epithet. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both host trees and avian populations.</p>
