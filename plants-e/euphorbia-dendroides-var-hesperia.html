<p>Euphorbia dendroides var. hesperia, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its waxy, gray-green foliage is adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dendroides var. hesperia is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to flourish.</p>
