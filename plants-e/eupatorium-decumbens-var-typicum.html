                    <h1>Eupatorium decumbens var. typicum</h1>
<p>Eupatorium decumbens var. typicum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often lie flat on the ground, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems.</p>
