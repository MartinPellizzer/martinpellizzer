<p>Euphorbia ammannioides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem with a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, giving it a distinctive, spiky appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ammannioides is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance.</p>
