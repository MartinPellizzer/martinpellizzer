<p>Eragrostis pilgeri subsp.</p>
<p>pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
