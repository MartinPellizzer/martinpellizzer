<p>Erucastrum varium f. tenuirostre, commonly known as the narrow-beaked erucoid, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions, often in woodland or streamside habitats. Its unique morphology, including the narrow beak-like structure of its fruit, distinguishes it from other members of the genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
