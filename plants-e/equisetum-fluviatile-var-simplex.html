                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile var. simplex</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile var. simplex, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it lacks true leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and paleobotanical importance.</p>
