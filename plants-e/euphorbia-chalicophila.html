<p>Euphorbia chalicophila, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
