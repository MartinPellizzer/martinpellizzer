                    <h1>Eleocharis nodulosa var. humilis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis nodulosa var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a flowering plant species native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and marsh ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, enhancing its ecological resilience.</p>
