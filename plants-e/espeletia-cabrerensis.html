<p>Espeletia cabrerensis, commonly known as the Cabrerensis heather, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and p√°ramo ecosystems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink, arranged in a rounded inflorescence. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help it withstand cold and dry conditions.</p>
<p>Espeletia cabrerensis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays an important role in its native ecosystem.</p>
