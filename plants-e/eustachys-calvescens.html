                    <h1>Eustachys calvescens</h1>
<p>Eustachys calvescens, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its tolerance for salt and wind.</p>
<p>Eustachys calvescens plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
