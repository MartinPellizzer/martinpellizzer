<p>Euphorbia crassinodis, commonly known as the thick-noded spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with distinctive, swollen nodes that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia crassinodis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
