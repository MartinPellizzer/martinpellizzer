<p>Euphorbia esula subsp.</p>
<p>esula, commonly known as leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions of North America.</p>
