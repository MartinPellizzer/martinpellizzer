                    <h1>Erigeron alpinus var. multicaulis</h1>
<p>Erigeron alpinus var. multicaulis, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its variability in stem structure, with multiple stems arising from the base, is a distinguishing characteristic of the varietal form.</p>
