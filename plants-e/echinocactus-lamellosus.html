<p>Echinocactus lamellosus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus lamellosus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
