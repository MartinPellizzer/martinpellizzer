                    <h1>Ephemerum bicolor</h1>
<p>Ephemerum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ephemeral, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking bi-coloration, with leaves that transition from green to red as the plant matures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom briefly during the summer months. Due to its short lifespan and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
