<p>Ephemerantha interjecta, commonly known as the "transient flower," is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often only flowering for a short time before withering, which contributes to its common name. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ephemerantha interjecta is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
