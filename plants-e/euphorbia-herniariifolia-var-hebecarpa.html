<p>Euphorbia herniariifolia var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative succulent.</p>
