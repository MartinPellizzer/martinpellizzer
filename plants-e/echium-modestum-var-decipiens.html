                    <h1>Echium modestum var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Echium modestum var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its deceptive appearance, as the flowers open at night, misleading diurnal observers into thinking it is not in bloom during the day.</p>
