<p>Eria lindleyi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
