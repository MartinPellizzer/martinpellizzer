The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the summer months. It thrives in moist, often disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it a notable example of a living fossil.</p>
