<p>Epipogium taiwanense, commonly known as the Taiwan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are often hidden within the dense foliage of its forest habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
