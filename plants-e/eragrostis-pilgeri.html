                    <h1>Eragrostis pilgeri</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pilgeri, commonly known as Pilger's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis pilgeri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
