<p>Epipactis provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial helleborine, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
