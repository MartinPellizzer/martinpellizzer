                    <h1>Euphorbia pusilla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
