<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
