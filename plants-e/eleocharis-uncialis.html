<p>Eleocharis uncialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis uncialis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
