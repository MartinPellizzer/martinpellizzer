                    <h1>Eucalyptus nitida</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus nitida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus nitida is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native Australian ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticultural studies.</p>
