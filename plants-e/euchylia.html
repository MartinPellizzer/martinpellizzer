<p>Euchylia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by triangular, woody fruits. Euchylia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
