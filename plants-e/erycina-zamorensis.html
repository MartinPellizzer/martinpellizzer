<p>Erycina zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white blooms with intricate patterns, often resembling those of other orchid genera. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erycina zamorensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
