                            <h1>Elymus Debilis</h1>
<p>Elymus debilis is a delicate grass species commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen along coastal dunes and dry slopes. This plant is known for its low growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Despite its small size, Elymus debilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its resilience makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
