<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red蒴果 that split open to reveal seeds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and unique fruiting structures.</p>
<p>Euonymus echinatus is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
