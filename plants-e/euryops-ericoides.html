                    <h1>Euryops ericoides</h1>
<p>Euryops ericoides, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Euryops ericoides is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dune systems.</p>
