<p>Euphorbia bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bolusii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
