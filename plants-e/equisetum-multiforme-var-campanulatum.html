                    <h1>Equisetum multiforme var. campanulatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum multiforme var. campanulatum, commonly known as the campanulatum horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a tall, spore-bearing stem that emerges in early spring. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in wetlands or along stream banks. It lacks true leaves and instead has microphylls, which are small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The species is known for its primitive morphology and is often used in ecological studies to understand ancient plant evolution.</p>
