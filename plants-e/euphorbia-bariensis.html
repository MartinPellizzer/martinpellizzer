                    <h1>Euphorbia bariensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bariensis, commonly known as the Bari euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
