<p>Euterpe catinga var. roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima palm, is a rare and endemic species found in the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of high-altitude rock formations, adapting to the unique environmental conditions of these isolated ecosystems. Its fruits are small, yellow berries that contain edible seeds, making it a valuable resource for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, the species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
