<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Blodgett's spurge is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
