                    <h1>Eriosyce fulva</h1>
<p>Eriosyce fulva, commonly known as the yellow pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a cushion-like structure, which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Eriosyce fulva is adapted to extreme desert conditions with a slow growth rate and thick, waxy skin to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is a popular specimen for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
