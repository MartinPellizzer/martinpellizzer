                    <h1>Echinopaepale</h1>
<p>Echinopaepale, commonly known as the spiny pale orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spiky floral structure. The plant produces small, pale-colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between late autumn and early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand the harsh, high-altitude climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echinopaepale is considered a conservation concern.</p>
