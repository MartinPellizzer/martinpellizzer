<p>Ervum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a small annual legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters, featuring slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
