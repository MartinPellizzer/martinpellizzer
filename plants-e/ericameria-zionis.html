<p>Ericameria zionis, commonly known as the Zion goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in Utah and Nevada.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high elevations. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a unique visual texture.</p>
<p>Ericameria zionis is also valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
