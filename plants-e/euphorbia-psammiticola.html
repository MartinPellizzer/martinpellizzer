                    <h1>Euphorbia psammiticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia psammiticola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
