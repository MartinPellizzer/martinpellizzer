                    <h1>Eritrichium fruticosum</h1>
<p>Eritrichium fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping eritrichium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eritrichium fruticosum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
