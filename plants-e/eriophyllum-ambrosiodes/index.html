                            <h1>Eriophyllum Ambrosiodes</h1>
<p>Ambrosia, scientifically known as Eriophyllum ambrosiodes, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. This annual plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting a variety of pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, Ambrosia is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing food and habitat for wildlife.</p>
