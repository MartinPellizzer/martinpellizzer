<p>Epidendrum xipheres, commonly known as the Crimson Spikes Vanda, is a hybrid orchid that combines traits from the Vanda and Epidendrum genera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in dense spikes, making it a visually stunning plant. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It requires bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive, typical of many tropical orchids.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of broad, glossy leaves that help in photosynthesis and water retention.</p>
