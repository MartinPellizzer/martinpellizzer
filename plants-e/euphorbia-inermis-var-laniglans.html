<p>Euphorbia inermis var. laniglans, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant.</p>
