                    <h1>Echinocactus polyacanthus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus polyacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
