                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus guerraianus</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus guerraianus, commonly known as the Guerraianus cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are produced at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
