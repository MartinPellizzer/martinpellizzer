                    <h1>Exodiclis angustifolia</h1>
<p>Exodiclis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy habitats, contributing to its ecological importance.</p>
<p>Exodiclis angustifolia is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
