                    <h1>Elionurus adustus var. calvescens</h1>
<p>Elionurus adustus var. calvescens, commonly known as the desert sungrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession within disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
