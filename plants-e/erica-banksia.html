                <h1>Erica banksia</h1>
<p>Erica banksia, commonly known as the banksia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae, native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>These shrubs or trees are characterized by their distinctive cylindrical or spikelike inflorescences, which are often brightly colored and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in the dry, nutrient-poor soils of their native habitat. Erica banksia species are also known for their hard, woody cones that persist on the plant for many years, providing a unique feature in the landscape.</p>
<p>The genus is particularly important in the ecological systems of Australia, supporting a wide range of wildlife.</p>
