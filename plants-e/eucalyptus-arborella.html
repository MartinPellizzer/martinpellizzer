                    <h1>Eucalyptus arborella</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus arborella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus arborella plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.</p>
