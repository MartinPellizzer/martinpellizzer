                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. flagelliferum</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. flagelliferum, commonly known as the creeping wood rush, is a perennial fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of sterile and fertile stems.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, slender, unbranched stem that grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors, preferring acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its persistence in suitable habitats.</p>
