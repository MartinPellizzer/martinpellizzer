                    <h1>Epidendrum rugulosum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum rugulosum, commonly known as the rugose epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
