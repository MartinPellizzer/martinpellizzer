                    <h1>Echeveria globosa</h1>
<p>Echeveria globosa, commonly known as the globular echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Echeveria globosa is prized for its compact form and ornamental appeal, particularly when it blooms.</p>
