                    <h1>Euphorbia defoliata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia defoliata, commonly known as the leafless spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by vibrant yellow bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbia defoliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
