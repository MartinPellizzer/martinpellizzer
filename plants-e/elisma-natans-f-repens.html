<p>Elisma natans f. repens, commonly known as the creeping water-plantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often borne on long, slender stalks.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, spreading along the water's surface or substrate.</p>
