<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. campanulatum, commonly known as the "whips" or "scouring rush," is a species of horsetail that exhibits distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are often clustered in a whorl. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments.</p>
