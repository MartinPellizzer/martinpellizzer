                    <h1>Epilobium venustum</h1>
<p>Epilobium venustum, commonly known as the purple willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs and produces showy, pink to purple flowers with four petals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epilobium venustum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a weed and a valuable pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
