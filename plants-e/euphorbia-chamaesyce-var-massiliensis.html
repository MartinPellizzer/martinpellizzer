                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. massiliensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. massiliensis, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
