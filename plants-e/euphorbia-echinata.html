                    <h1>Euphorbia echinata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia echinata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
