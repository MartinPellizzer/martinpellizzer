                    <h1>Elatine opposita</h1>
<p>Elatine opposita, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that appear above the water surface. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed water bodies make it an important pioneer species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Elatine opposita is also notable for its ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions, contributing to water clarity and habitat complexity.</p>
