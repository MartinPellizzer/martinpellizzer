                    <h1>Euphorbia sabulicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sabulicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
