                    <h1>Euphorbia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dichotoma is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
