                    <h1>Euphorbia tumbaensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tumbaensis, commonly known as the Tumba spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high rainfall of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
