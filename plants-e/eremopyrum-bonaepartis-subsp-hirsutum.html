<p>The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
