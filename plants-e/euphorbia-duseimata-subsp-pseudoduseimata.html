<p>Euphorbia duseimata subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoduseimata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
