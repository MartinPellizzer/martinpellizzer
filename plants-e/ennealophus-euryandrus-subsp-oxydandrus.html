<p>Ennealophus euryandrus subsp.</p>
<p>oxydandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spores rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of its fern classification. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
