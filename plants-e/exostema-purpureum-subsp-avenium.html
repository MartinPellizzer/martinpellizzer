<p>Exostema purpureum subsp.</p>
<p>avenium, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a striking orchid species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and pink flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
