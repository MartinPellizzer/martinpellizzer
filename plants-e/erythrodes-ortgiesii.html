<p>It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erythrodes ortgiesii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
