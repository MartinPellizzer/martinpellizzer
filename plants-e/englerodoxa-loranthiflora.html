<p>Englerodoxa loranthiflora, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
