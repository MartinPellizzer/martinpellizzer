                    <h1>Elaphoglossum ballardianum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum ballardianum, commonly known as the Ballard's holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species among ferns.</p>
