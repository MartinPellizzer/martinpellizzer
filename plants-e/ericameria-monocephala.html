<p>Ericameria monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed ericameria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ericameria monocephala is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
