                    <h1>Euphorbia sibthorpii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sibthorpii, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sibthorpii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
