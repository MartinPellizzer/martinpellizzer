                    <h1>Erodium robertianum</h1>
<p>Erodium robertianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pithy, hairy fruit that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Erodium robertianum is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
