                    <h1>Erophila inconspicua</h1>
<p>Erophila inconspicua, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a small annual herb native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its inconspicuous appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability.</p>
