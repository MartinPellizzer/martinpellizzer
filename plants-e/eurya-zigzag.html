                    <h1>Eurya zigzag</h1>
<p>Eurya zigzag, commonly known as the zigzag eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its zigzagging stems, which give it its common name, and its small, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Eurya zigzag is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade.</p>
