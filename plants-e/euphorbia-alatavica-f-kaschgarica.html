<p>Euphorbia alatavica f. kaschgarica, commonly known as the Karakum euphorbia, is a unique succulent plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically emerging from the axils of the leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution.</p>
