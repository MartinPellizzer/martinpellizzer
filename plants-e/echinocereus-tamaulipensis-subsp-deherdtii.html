<p>Echinocereus tamaulipensis subsp.</p>
<p>deherdtii, commonly known as the Tamaulipan hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with dense, spiny stems that often form clumps or small colonies.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the axils of the spines. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
