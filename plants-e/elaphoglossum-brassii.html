<p>Elaphoglossum brassii, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing in dense undergrowth or on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
