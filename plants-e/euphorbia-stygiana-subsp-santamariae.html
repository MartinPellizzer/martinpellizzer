<p>Euphorbia stygiana subsp.</p>
<p>santamariae, commonly known as the Santa Maria euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting it to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
