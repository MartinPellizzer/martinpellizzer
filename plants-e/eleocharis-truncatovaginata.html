<p>Eleocharis truncatovaginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow ponds, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, and the plant produces small, three-angled berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Eleocharis truncatovaginata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
