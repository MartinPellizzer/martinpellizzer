                    <h1>Eriocaulon flaccidum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its environment.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon flaccidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
