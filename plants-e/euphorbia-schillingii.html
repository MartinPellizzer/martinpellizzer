                    <h1>Euphorbia schillingii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia schillingii, commonly known as Schilling's spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which is a common feature in many species of the Euphorbia genus.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
