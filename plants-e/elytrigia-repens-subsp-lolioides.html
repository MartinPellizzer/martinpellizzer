<p>Elytrigia repens subsp.</p>
<p>lolioides, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is also cultivated as a turfgrass in some regions.</p>
