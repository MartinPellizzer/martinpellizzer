                    <h1>Ephedra antisyphilitica</h1>
<p>Ephedra antisyphilitica, commonly known as the Siberian ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
