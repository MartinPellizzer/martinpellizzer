                    <h1>Eucalyptus sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it well-suited for stabilizing soils in dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus sclerophylla is often found in heathlands and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
