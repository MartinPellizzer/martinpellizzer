<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce, commonly known as petty spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are usually covered in a white, powdery coating called a pruina. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds.</p>
