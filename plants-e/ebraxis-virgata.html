<p>Ebraxis virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
