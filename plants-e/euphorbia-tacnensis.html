<p>Euphorbia tacnensis, commonly known as the Tacna euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tacnensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
