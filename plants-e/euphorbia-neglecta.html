                    <h1>Euphorbia neglecta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neglecta, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation.</p>
