                    <h1>Ephedra dahurica</h1>
<p>Ephedra dahurica, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its green, branched stems that resemble wood and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and reddish-brown seed pods, which contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Ephedra dahurica is adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its stems and exhibiting a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional Chinese medicine for its stimulant properties, though its use is now regulated due to the presence of ephedrine.</p>
