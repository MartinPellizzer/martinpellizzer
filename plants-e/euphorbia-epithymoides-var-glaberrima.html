                    <h1>Euphorbia epithymoides var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia epithymoides var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to harsh environments.</p>
