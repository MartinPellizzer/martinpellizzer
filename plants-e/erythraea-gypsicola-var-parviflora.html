                    <h1>Erythraea gypsicola var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Erythraea gypsicola var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered gypsum erythraea, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in arid, saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, allowing it to store water in its tissues. It is often found in gypsum soils, where it forms dense mats or low-growing shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
