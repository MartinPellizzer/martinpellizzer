<p>Echinocactus beguinii, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in thick, spiny ribs that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels at the base of the stem. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus beguinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
