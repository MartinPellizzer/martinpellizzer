                    <h1>Eleocharis cancellata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis cancellata, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize shoreline environments. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The small, pale flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
