                    <h1>Erophila vulgaris var. muricola</h1>
<p>Erophila vulgaris var. muricola, commonly known as the rough false flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in wet meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
