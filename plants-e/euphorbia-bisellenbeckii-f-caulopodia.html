                    <h1>Euphorbia bisellenbeckii f. caulopodia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bisellenbeckii f. caulopodia, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a unique variant of the species characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It forms low, mat-like structures with tightly packed, fleshy stems and leaves, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This succulent is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
