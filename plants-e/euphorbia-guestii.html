                    <h1>Euphorbia guestii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia guestii, commonly known as the Blue Glow euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features striking blue-gray foliage with a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
