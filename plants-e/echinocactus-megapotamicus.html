                    <h1>Echinocactus megapotamicus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus megapotamicus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of bright yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiky exterior. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
