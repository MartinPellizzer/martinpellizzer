                    <h1>Euphorbia caput-medusae var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia caput-medusae var. minor, commonly known as the lesser crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem with numerous spiny, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and sharp spines, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments.</p>
