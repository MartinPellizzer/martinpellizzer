<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested and should be handled with care.</p>
