<p>Elymus arenarius subsp.</p>
<p>sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in loose panicles, with awned lemmas that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common component of dry grasslands and dunes.</p>
