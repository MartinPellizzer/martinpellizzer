                    <h1>Echinopsis tetracantha</h1>
<p>Echinopsis tetracantha, commonly known as the four-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and minimal leaf structure, adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-lived member of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to thrive in conditions with limited rainfall.</p>
