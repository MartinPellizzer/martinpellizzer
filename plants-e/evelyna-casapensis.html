<p>Evelyna casapensis, commonly known as the Casapensian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Evelyna casapensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
