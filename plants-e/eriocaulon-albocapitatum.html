                    <h1>Eriocaulon albocapitatum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon albocapitatum, commonly known as the white-headed flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale-colored flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon albocapitatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
