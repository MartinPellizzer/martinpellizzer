<p>Ebnerella prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the wet conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Ebnerella prolifera is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
