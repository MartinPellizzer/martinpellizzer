<p>Echinofossulocactus helophorus var. longifossulatus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in long, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its growth habit is typically solitary or in small clusters, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
