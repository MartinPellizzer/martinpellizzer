                    <h1>Euphorbia villifera var. crepuscula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia villifera var. crepuscula, commonly known as the evening euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
