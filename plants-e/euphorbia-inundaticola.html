                    <h1>Euphorbia inundaticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia inundaticola, commonly known as the floodplain spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or seasonally flooded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist habitats where it can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to survive in challenging conditions, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
