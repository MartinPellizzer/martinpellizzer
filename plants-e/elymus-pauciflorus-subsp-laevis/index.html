                            <h1>Elymus Pauciflorus Subsp. Laevis</h1>
<p>Elymus laevis, scientifically known as Elymus pauciflorus subsp. laevis, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. This perennial plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce few florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
