<p>Elymus gmelinii subsp.</p>
<p>ugamicus, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spikelet clusters that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural purposes.</p>
