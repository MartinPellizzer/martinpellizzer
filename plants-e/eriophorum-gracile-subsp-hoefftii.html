<p>Eriophorum gracile subsp.</p>
<p>hoefftii, commonly known as the slender cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, white or pale brown seed heads that resemble cotton.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing peatland ecosystems.</p>
