                    <h1>Encephalartos nubimontanus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos nubimontanus, commonly known as the cloud mountain cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
