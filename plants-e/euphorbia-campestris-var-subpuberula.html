<p>Euphorbia campestris var. subpuberula, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming stems covered in soft, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
