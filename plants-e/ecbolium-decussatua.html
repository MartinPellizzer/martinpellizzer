<p>Ecbolium decussatua, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are often clustered and scale-like, reducing resistance in water.</p>
<p>Ecbolium decussatua plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the food web.</p>
