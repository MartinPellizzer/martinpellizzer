<p>Euphorbia kelleri var. kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to full sun. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
