<p>Eriosyce islayensis subsp.</p>
<p>omasensis, commonly known as the Islay Omasa cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that often develops a flattened, disc-like shape with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
