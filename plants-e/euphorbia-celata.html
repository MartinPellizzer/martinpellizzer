                    <h1>Euphorbia celata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia celata, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it should be handled with care.</p>
