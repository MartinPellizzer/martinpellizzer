<p>Echinocereus angusticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spine-tipped stems that branch out into a shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
