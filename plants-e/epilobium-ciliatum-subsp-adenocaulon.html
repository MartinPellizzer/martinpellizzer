<p>Epilobium ciliatum subsp.</p>
<p>adenocaulon, commonly known as the woolly willow or creeping willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem structure.</p>
