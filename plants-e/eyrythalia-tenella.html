<p>Eyrythalia tenella, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, reddish leaves that are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early summer. Eyrythalia tenella is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic species of tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and compact growth form help it retain moisture and withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
