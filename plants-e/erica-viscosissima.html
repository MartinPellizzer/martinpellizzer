                    <h1>Erica viscosissima</h1>
<p>Erica viscosissima, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact form and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Erica viscosissima is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
