<p>Elymus altissimus, commonly known as tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Elymus altissimus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and for its potential use in forage and erosion control.</p>
