<p>Efossus pentacanthus, commonly known as the five-armed fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its intricate, branching fronds that resemble the arms of a star.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, and are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Efossus pentacanthus is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
