<p>Epidendrum medusae, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems with showy, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly figures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
