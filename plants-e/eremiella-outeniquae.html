                    <h1>Eremiella outeniquae</h1>
<p>Eremiella outeniquae, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a liverwort and a fungus.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, where it forms a dense, crust-like growth on rocky surfaces. This plant is adapted to survive with minimal water, relying on fog and dew for moisture. Its structure helps it retain water and protect against intense sunlight and temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Eremiella outeniquae plays a crucial role in stabilizing the desert soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
