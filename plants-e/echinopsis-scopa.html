                    <h1>Echinopsis scopa</h1>
<p>Echinopsis scopa, commonly known as the white echinopsis, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a spiny exterior, which helps protect it from herbivores and excessive moisture loss. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Its nocturnal flowering habit is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract specific pollinators.</p>
