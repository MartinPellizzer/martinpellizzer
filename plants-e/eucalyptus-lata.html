<p>Eucalyptus lata, commonly known as the broad-leaved stringy gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its bark is fibrous and peels off in long, stringy strips, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus lata is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
