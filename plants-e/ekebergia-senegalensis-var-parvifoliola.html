                    <h1>Ekebergia senegalensis var. parvifoliola</h1>
<p>Ekebergia senegalensis var. parvifoliola, commonly known as the small-leaved African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It is typically found in dry savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hard wood, it is sometimes harvested for local use, though it is not as economically significant as other species in the genus.</p>
