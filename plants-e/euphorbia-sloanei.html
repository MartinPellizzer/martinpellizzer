                    <h1>Euphorbia sloanei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sloanei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
