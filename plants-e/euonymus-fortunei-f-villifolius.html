<p>Euonymus fortunei f. villifolius, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, oval to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, bead-like fruits. It is well-suited for use as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a valuable addition to shaded or partially shaded landscapes.</p>
