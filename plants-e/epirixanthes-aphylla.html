<p>Epirixanthes aphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and roots. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Epirixanthes aphylla is native to parts of South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
