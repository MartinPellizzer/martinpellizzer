                    <h1>Eriocaulon lacustre</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon lacustre, commonly known as the lake spikerush, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, forming dense stands that help stabilize sediment. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale flowers. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon lacustre plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
