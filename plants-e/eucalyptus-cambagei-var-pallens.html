                    <h1>Eucalyptus cambagei var. pallens</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus cambagei var. pallens, commonly known as the Grey Box or Grey Ironbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery or greyish underside, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to dry climates and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands.</p>
