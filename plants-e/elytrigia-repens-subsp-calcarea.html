<p>Elytrigia repens subsp.</p>
<p>calcarea, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
