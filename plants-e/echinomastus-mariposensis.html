                    <h1>Echinomastus mariposensis</h1>
<p>Echinomastus mariposensis, commonly known as the Mariposa spineflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that are modified stems, a feature common in many species of the genus Echinomastus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
