<p>Enckea lata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.
