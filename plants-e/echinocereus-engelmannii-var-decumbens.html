                    <h1>Echinocereus engelmannii var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Echinocereus engelmannii var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent hedgehog cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with cylindrical stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on erect, hairy stems. Its spines are usually pale yellow to white, and the stems are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
