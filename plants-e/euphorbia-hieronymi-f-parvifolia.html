                    <h1>Euphorbia hieronymi f. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hieronymi f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a crown of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for container gardening.</p>
