                    <h1>Euphorbia pumila</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pumila, commonly known as the cushion spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, thick leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pumila contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
