<p>Eremophila phyllopoda, commonly known as the leafless emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremophila phyllopoda is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
