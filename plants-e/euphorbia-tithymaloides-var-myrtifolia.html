                    <h1>Euphorbia tithymaloides var. myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tithymaloides var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
