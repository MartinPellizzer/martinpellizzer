<p>Euphorbia oxycoccoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia oxycoccoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
