                    <h1>Euphorbia pectinata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pectinata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pectinata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
