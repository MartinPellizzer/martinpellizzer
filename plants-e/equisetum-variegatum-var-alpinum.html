                    <h1>Equisetum variegatum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Equisetum variegatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine millipede fern, is a variant of the variable horsetail.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green with a reddish hue. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are clustered in whorls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
