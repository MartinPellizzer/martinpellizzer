                    <h1>Ephedra antisyphilitica f. monstrosa</h1>
<p>Ephedra antisyphilitica f. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant ephedra, is a variant of the ephedra plant characterized by its unusually large size and robust growth.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and Kazakhstan. The plant features elongated, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential for misuse and the presence of toxic alkaloids, it is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
