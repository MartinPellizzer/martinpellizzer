<p>Epipogium roseum, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
