<p>Euphorbia hyberna var. canuti, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
