<p>Ervatamia dakgleiensis, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal ervatamia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
