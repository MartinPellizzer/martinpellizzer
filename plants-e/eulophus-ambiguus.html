                    <h1>Eulophus ambiguus</h1>
<p>Eulophus ambiguus, commonly known as the false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It produces small, smooth fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Eulophus ambiguus is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true nettles.</p>
