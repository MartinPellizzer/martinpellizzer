<p>Elaphoglossum cotapatense, commonly known as the Cotapata holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Bolivia and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum cotapatense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
