<p>Elymus sajanensis subsp.</p>
<p>hyperarcticus, commonly known as the Arctic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Arctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread and stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a crucial role in the ecological dynamics of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
