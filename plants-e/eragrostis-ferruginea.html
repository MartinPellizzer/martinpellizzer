                    <h1>Eragrostis ferruginea</h1>
<p>Eragrostis ferruginea, commonly known as rusty foxtail, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, pointed leaves that are often tinged with reddish or brownish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
