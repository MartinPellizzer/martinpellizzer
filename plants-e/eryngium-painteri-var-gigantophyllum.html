<p>Eryngium painteri var. gigantophyllum, commonly known as the giant coneflower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage with stiff, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
