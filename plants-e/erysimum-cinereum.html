                    <h1>Erysimum cinereum</h1>
<p>Erysimum cinereum, commonly known as hoary whitlowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance.</p>
<p>Erysimum cinereum is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
