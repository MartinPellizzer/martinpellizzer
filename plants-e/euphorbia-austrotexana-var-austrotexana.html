                    <h1>Euphorbia austrotexana var. austrotexana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia austrotexana var. austrotexana, commonly known as the Texas euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Euphorbia austrotexana var. austrotexana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
