                    <h1>Euphorbia exstipulata var. lata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exstipulata var. lata, commonly known as the broad-leafed spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
