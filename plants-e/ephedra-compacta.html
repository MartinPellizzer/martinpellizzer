                    <h1>Ephedra compacta</h1>
<p>Ephedra compacta, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Ephedra compacta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
