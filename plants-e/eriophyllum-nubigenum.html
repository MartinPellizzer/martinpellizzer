<p>Eriophyllum nubigenum, commonly known as the fogplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to thrive in salty, windy, and foggy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Eriophyllum nubigenum is an important part of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for native wildlife.</p>
