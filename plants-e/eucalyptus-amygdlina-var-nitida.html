<p>Eucalyptus amygdlina var. nitida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The flowers are usually white or pale blue and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
