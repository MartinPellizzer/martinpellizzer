                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. humile</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. humile, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Equisetum elongatum, with a more compact growth form.</p>
