                    <h1>Eriocoma × caduca</h1>
<p>Eriocoma × caduca, commonly known as the hybrid eriocoma, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which provide insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates.</p>
