                    <h1>Erucastrum supinum</h1>
<p>Erucastrum supinum, commonly known as the creeping rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Erucastrum supinum is also valued in some regions for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to mustard greens.</p>
