<p>Euphorbia polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which store water to help it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant can grow up to 3 feet tall.</p>
<p>Euphorbia polyphylla is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
