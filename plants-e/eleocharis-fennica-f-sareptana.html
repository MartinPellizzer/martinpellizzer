                    <h1>Eleocharis fennica f. sareptana</h1>
<p>Eleocharis fennica f. sareptana, commonly known as the Sareptan spike-rush, is a botanical variant of the spike-rush genus Eleocharis.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences composed of numerous tiny spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its morphology is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with short, rhizomatous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological niche and morphological distinctions from other Eleocharis species.</p>
