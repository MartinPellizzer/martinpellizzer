<p>Eriophorum komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Eriophorum komarovii is an important component of the vegetation in polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
