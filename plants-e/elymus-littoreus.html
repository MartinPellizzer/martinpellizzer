                    <h1>Elymus littoreus</h1>
<p>Elymus littoreus, commonly known as seaside barley or beachgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used for dune stabilization due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Elymus littoreus plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
