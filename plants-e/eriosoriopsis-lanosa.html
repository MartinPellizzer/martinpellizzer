                    <h1>Eriosoriopsis lanosa</h1>
<p>Eriosoriopsis lanosa, commonly known as the woolly rust fungus, is a species of rust fungus that primarily affects plants in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, powdery, yellowish-orange spore masses that appear on the underside of infected leaves. The fungus produces a unique type of rust called a "winter rust," which overwinters on infected plant debris. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The presence of Eriosoriopsis lanosa can lead to significant leaf discoloration and defoliation in susceptible host plants.</p>
