                    <h1>Eschweilera klugii</h1>
<p>Eschweilera klugii, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Eschweilera klugii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
