                    <h1>Endostemon wakefieldii</h1>
<p>Endostemon wakefieldii, commonly known as Wakefield's endostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
