                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. pilosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
