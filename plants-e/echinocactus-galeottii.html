<p>Echinocactus galeottii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of bright yellow spines. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and bloom at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>Echinocactus galeottii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
