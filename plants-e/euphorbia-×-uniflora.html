                    <h1>Euphorbia × uniflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia × uniflora, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, thorn-like leaves and stems, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
