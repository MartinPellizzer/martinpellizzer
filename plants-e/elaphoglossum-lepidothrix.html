<p>Elaphoglossum lepidothrix, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, pale hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum lepidothrix is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, tropical climates.</p>
