                    <h1>Eucalyptus sheathiana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus sheathiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus sheathiana is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>Its aromatic oils have been used in traditional medicine and for their antimicrobial properties.</p>
