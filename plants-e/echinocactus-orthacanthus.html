                    <h1>Echinocactus orthacanthus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus orthacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny, cylindrical stem that resembles a barrel, which helps it store water for long periods. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained soil make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and low maintenance requirements have made it a favored ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
