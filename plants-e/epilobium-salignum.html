<p>Epilobium salignum, commonly known as sea buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in maritime climates. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Epilobium salignum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
