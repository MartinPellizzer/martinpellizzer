                    <h1>Elaphoglossum dannoritzeri</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum dannoritzeri, commonly known as the Dannoritzer's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its spores are released in a unique, clustered formation, aiding in its dispersal within the dense forest understory.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
