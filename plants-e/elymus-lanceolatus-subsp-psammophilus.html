<p>Elymus lanceolatus subsp.</p>
<p>psammophilus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and contribute to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is often found in dunes, grasslands, and along the edges of deserts, playing a vital role in ecological succession and habitat provision.</p>
