                    <h1>Echinopsis fallax var. shaferi</h1>
<p>Echinopsis fallax var. shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance plant.</p>
