<p>Evax exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Evax exigua plays an important role in supporting native pollinators, particularly butterflies.</p>
