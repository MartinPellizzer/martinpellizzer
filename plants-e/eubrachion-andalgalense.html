<p>Eubrachion andalgalense, commonly known as the Andalusian brachion, is a rare aquatic plant native to southern Spain.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Characeae and is characterized by its filamentous structure and branching growth pattern. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its microscopic size and specialized cellular structures enable it to absorb nutrients efficiently from its surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
