                    <h1>Ericameria discoidea</h1>
<p>Ericameria discoidea, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. Ericameria discoidea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for native wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
