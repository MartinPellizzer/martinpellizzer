                    <h1>Elymus × gouldii</h1>
<p>Elymus × gouldii, commonly known as the gould's wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soils. Elymus × gouldii is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry slopes, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
