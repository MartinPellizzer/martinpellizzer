<p>Echinocereus parkeri var. gonzalezii, commonly known as the Gonzalez's hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts.</p>
