                    <h1>Epithecia humilis</h1>
<p>Epithecia humilis, commonly known as the lowland epithecia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on calcareous substrates, such as limestone, in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
