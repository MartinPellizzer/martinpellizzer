                    <h1>Euonymus ligustrinus</h1>
<p>Euonymus ligustrinus, commonly known as the evergreen boxwood, is a shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often used in horticulture for topiary and ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to maintain shape.</p>
<p>Euonymus ligustrinus prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
