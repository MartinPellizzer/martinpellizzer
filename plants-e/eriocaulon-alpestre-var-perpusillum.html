                    <h1>Eriocaulon alpestre var. perpusillum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon alpestre var. perpusillum, commonly known as the alpine spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain stream banks. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora.</p>
