<p>Eragrostis diandra, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name, and it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis diandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
