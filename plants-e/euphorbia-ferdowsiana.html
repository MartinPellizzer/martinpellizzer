                    <h1>Euphorbia ferdowsiana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ferdowsiana, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, adapting to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ferdowsiana is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
