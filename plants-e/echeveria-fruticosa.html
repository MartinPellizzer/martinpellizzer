                    <h1>Echeveria fruticosa</h1>
<p>Echeveria fruticosa, commonly known as the Silver Sword, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, and it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
