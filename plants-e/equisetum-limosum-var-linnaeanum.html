<p>Equisetum limosum var. linnaeanum, commonly known as the creeping marsh willow, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of annular rings on its stems. The plant typically grows in wet, muddy environments such as marshes and along stream banks. It lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called enations.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
