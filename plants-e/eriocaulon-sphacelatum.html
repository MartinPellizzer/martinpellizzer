<p>Eriocaulon sphacelatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a member of the Poales order and the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon sphacelatum plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
