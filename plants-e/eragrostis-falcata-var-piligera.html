                    <h1>Eragrostis falcata var. piligera</h1>
<p>Eragrostis falcata var. piligera, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, especially along the midribs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it an important component of arid ecosystems.</p>
