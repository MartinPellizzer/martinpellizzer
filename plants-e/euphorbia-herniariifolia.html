                    <h1>Euphorbia herniariifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia herniariifolia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
