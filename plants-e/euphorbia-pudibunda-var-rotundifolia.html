<p>Euphorbia pudibunda var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
