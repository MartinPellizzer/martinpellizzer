                    <h1>Euphorbia hottentota</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hottentota, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, spiky inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding vibrant color to gardens. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>However, its milky sap can be irritating to skin, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
