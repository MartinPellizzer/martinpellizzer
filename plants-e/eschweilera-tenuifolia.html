<p>Eschweilera tenuifolia, commonly known as the Guiana dwarf mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
