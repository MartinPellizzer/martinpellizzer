                    <h1>Eumorphia</h1>
<p>Eumorphia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Eumorphia is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found growing on the bark of trees in wet, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
