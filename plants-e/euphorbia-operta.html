<p>Euphorbia operta, commonly known as the shield tree or sacred tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, shield-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia operta is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine.</p>
