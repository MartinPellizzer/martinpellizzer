                    <h1>Eucalyptus erubescens</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus erubescens, commonly known as the red gum, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that often displays a reddish hue, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that range from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus erubescens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, make it valuable for both medicinal and industrial uses.</p>
