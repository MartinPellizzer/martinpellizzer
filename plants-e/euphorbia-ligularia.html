                    <h1>Euphorbia ligularia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ligularia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
