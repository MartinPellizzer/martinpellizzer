                    <h1>Echinochloa elephantipes</h1>
<p>Echinochloa elephantipes, commonly known as elephant foot grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and a dense cluster of leaves at the base, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant can grow up to several meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
