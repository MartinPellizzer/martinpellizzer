                    <h1>Eriospermum tortuosum var. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Eriospermum tortuosum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the slender eriosperm, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in rocky or coastal environments, where it adapts to harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
