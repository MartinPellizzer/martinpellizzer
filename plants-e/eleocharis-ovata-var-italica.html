<p>Eleocharis ovata var. italica, commonly known as the Italian spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, with small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
