                    <h1>Elymus racemosus</h1>
<p>Elymus racemosus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Elymus racemosus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in grassland ecosystems.</p>
