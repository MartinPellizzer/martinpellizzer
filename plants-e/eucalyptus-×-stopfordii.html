                    <h1>Eucalyptus × stopfordii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × stopfordii, commonly known as the Sydney peppermint, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and smooth, grey-green bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fragrant, peppermint-like aroma when crushed. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its essential oils in aromatherapy and traditional medicine.</p>
