                    <h1>Eleocharis compressa var. atrata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis compressa var. atrata, commonly known as black needlegrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark-colored spikelets that resemble needles, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with short, rhizomatous stems that help it spread vegetatively. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces tiny, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Eleocharis compressa var. atrata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
