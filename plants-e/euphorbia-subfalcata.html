                    <h1>Euphorbia subfalcata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia subfalcata, commonly known as the sickle euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia subfalcata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
