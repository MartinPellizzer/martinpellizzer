                    <h1>Erica setula</h1>
<p>Erica setula, commonly known as the silky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with fine, silver-gray hairs that give it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica setula is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
