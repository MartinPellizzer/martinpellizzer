<p>Eremophila tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its greyish, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Eremophila tuberculata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
