                    <h1>Euphorbia dumeticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dumeticola, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with fleshy, ribbed leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dumeticola is well adapted to harsh desert environments, thriving in full sun and low water conditions.</p>
