                    <h1>Echinocactus hamatacanthus var. brevispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus hamatacanthus var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, spiny areoles, which are typically adorned with white bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom from the areoles. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
