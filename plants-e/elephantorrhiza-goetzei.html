<p>Elephantorrhiza goetzei, commonly known as the African elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.

Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>
