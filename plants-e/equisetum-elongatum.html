                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, needle-like spines. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>Equisetum elongatum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
