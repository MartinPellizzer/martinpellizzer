<p>Ervatamia membranacea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Ervatamia membranacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
