                    <h1>Euchile mariae</h1>
<p>Euchile mariae, commonly known as the Marie's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euchile mariae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
