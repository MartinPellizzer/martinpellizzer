<p>Euphorbia suborbicularis, commonly known as the orange cup euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and unique, cup-shaped structures that contain the plant's toxic latex. The leaves are typically small, waxy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are often enclosed within a modified stem called a cyathium.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
