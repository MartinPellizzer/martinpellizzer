                    <h1>Encephalartos caffer</h1>
<p>Encephalartos caffer, commonly known as the Natal knobbed cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
