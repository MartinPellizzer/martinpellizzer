<p>Esenbeckia pilocarpoides subsp.</p>
<p>pilocarpoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, glossy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its dense, hard wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
