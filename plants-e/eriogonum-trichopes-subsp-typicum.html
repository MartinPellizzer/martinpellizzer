<p>Eriogonum trichopes subsp.</p>
<p>typicum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
