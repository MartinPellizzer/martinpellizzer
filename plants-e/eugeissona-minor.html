<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eugeissona minor is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
