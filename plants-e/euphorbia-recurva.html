<p>Euphorbia recurva, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia recurva is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
