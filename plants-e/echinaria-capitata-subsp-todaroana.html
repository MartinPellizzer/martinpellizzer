<p>Echinaria capitata subsp.</p>
<p>todaroana, commonly known as the Todaroan tarplant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
