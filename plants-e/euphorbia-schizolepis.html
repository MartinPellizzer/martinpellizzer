<p>Euphorbia schizolepis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia schizolepis is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine.</p>
