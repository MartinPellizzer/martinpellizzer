                    <h1>Echinocactus radiosus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus radiosus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of bright yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus radiosus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
