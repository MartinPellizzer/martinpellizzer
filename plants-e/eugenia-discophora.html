                    <h1>Eugenia discophora</h1>
<p>Eugenia discophora, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red mangosteen, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not as well-known as the mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana). Eugenia discophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
