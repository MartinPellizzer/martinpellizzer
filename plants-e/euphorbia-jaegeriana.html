<p>Euphorbia jaegeriana, commonly known as the Jaeger's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
