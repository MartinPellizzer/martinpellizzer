                    <h1>Euphorbia meloformis var. prolifera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia meloformis var. prolifera, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its latex sap is milky and can be irritating, so it should be handled with care.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
