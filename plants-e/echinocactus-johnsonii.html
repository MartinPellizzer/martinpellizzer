                    <h1>Echinocactus johnsonii</h1>
<p>Echinocactus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Echinocactus johnsonii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
