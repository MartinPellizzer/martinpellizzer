                    <h1>Eleocharis rugosa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis rugosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis rugosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
