                    <h1>Epicycas siamensis</h1>
<p>Epicycas siamensis, commonly known as the Siam cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Epicycas siamensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and requiring minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
