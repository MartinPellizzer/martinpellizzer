The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
