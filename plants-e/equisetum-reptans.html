                    <h1>Equisetum reptans</h1>
<p>Equisetum reptans, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobila. Equisetum reptans is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plants on Earth.</p>
