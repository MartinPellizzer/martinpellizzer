                    <h1>Elaphoglossum mortonianum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum mortonianum, commonly known as the Mortonian holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
