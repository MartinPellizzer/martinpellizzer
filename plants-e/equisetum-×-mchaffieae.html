                    <h1>Equisetum × mchaffieae</h1>
<p>Equisetum × mchaffieae, commonly known as the hybrid scouring rush, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its historical use as a natural scouring agent has contributed to its common name, though it is not edible and should be handled with care.</p>
