                    <h1>Equisetum × meridionale</h1>
<p>Equisetum × meridionale, commonly known as the northern horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem covered with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and resilient species in its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and its unique morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to wet environments.</p>
