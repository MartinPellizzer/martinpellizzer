                    <h1>Elattostachys megalantha</h1>
<p>Elattostachys megalantha, commonly known as the giant flame bamboo, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, covered in vibrant red or orange bracts that resemble flames. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in full sun make it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>
<p>However, due to its aggressive spreading nature, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
