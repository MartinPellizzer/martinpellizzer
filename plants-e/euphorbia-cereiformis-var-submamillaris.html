                    <h1>Euphorbia cereiformis var. submamillaris</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cereiformis var. submamillaris, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
