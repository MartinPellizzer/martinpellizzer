<p>Euphorbia hyrcana, commonly known as the Hyrcanian spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hyrcana is also known for its milky latex, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
