                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. capense</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. capense, commonly known as the Cape rush or narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a species of horsetail native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in rough, abrasive nodes, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of the Equisetaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important indicator of wetland ecosystems.</p>
