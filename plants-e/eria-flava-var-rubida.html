                    <h1>Eria flava var. rubida</h1>
<p>Eria flava var. rubida, commonly known as the red-flowered eria, is a striking orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its vibrant red petals and yellow sepals, which contrast beautifully to attract pollinators. It typically grows as an epiphytic plant, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role within its ecosystem and its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
