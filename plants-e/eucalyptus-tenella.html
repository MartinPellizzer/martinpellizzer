                    <h1>Eucalyptus tenella</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and smooth, often aromatic bark. The plant produces small white or pink flowers, typically in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus tenella is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and ability to regenerate after fire make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem.</p>
