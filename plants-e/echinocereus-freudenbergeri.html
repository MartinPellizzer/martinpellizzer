                    <h1>Echinocereus freudenbergeri</h1>
<p>Echinocereus freudenbergeri, commonly known as the Freudenberger's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
