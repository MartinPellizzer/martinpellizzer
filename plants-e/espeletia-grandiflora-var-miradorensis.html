                    <h1>Espeletia grandiflora var. miradorensis</h1>
<p>Espeletia grandiflora var. miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador cushion plant, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray foliage, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking white to pale purple flower heads that bloom in late spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems.</p>
