                    <h1>Echeveria rigida</h1>
<p>Echeveria rigida, commonly known as the rigid echeveria, is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure composed of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It is a succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Echeveria rigida is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
