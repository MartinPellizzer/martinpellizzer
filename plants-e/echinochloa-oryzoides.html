                    <h1>Echinochloa oryzoides</h1>
<p>Echinochloa oryzoides, commonly known as false rice, is an annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown seeds. It is often found growing in wetlands, rice fields, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to cultivated rice, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
