                    <h1>Euphorbia odontophora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia odontophora, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often serrated or toothed, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Euphorbia odontophora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
