                    <h1>Euphorbia acalyphoides var. arabica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia acalyphoides var. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in landscaping in dry climates.</p>
