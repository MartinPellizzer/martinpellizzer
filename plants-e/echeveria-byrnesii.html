                    <h1>Echeveria byrnesii</h1>
<p>Echeveria byrnesii, commonly known as the Byrnes' echeveria, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces showy, violet-pink flowers on upright stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening.</p>
