<p>Erianthus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran grass, is a tall perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and long, narrow leaves that can reach several meters in height. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields or along riverbanks. Its fibrous structure makes it valuable for use in thatching and as a source of natural fibers.</p>
<p>Erianthus sumatranus also plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
