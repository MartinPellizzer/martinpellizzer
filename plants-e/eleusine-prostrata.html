                    <h1>Eleusine prostrata</h1>
<p>Eleusine prostrata, commonly known as prostrate eleusine, is a low-growing annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, narrow leaves arranged alternately. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes.</p>
