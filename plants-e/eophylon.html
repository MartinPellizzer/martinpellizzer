                    <h1>Eophylon</h1>
<p>Eophylon, commonly known as the "ancient sea lichen," is an extinct genus of early complex multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>It is considered one of the earliest known examples of a complex, multicellular structure in the fossil record. Eophylon fossils are typically found in Cambrian strata, suggesting they lived over 500 million years ago. These organisms had a branching, filamentous structure with distinct layers of cells, indicating some level of differentiation.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their role as a precursor to more complex life forms, providing insights into early evolutionary developments.</p>
