                    <h1>Epimedium simplicifolium</h1>
<p>Epimedium simplicifolium, commonly known as barrenwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth and heart-shaped, deciduous leaves that emerge in early spring. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and delicate blooms, though it is often cultivated for its medicinal properties.</p>
