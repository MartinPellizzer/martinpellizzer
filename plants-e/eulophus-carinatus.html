                    <h1>Eulophus carinatus</h1>
<p>Eulophus carinatus, commonly known as the carinate euphorbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed or ridged, a feature that gives it its specific epithet "carinatus.". The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to drought conditions with thick, fleshy stems that store water.</p>
<p>Eulophus carinatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
