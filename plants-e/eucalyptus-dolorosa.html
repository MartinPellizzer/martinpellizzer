                    <h1>Eucalyptus dolorosa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus dolorosa, commonly known as the black box gum, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus dolorosa is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
