                    <h1>Epicranthes glebodactyla</h1>
<p>Epicranthes glebodactyla, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in capturing small insects. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specialized care requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
