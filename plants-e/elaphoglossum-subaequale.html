                    <h1>Elaphoglossum subaequale</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum subaequale, commonly known as the equal-veined holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, nearly parallel venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum subaequale is often found in montane and lowland rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
