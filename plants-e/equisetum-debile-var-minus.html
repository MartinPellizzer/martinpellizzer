                    <h1>Equisetum debile var. minus</h1>
<p>Equisetum debile var. minus, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a diminutive variety of the horsetail plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its low stature and delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes.</p>
