                    <h1>Escocoryphantha henricksonii</h1>
<p>Escocoryphantha henricksonii, commonly known as the Henrickson's ghost flower, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pale pink or white, and they emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Escocoryphantha henricksonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
