<p>Ekebergia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates.</p>
<p>Ekebergia meyeri is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in local crafts and construction.</p>
