<p>Euryspermum salignum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with high salt content.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
