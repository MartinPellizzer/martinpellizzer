                    <h1>Epipactis × mohilewiensis</h1>
<p>Epipactis × mohilewiensis, commonly known as the Mohilev hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis palustris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive dark red or purple lip. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows across Eastern Europe. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability.</p>
