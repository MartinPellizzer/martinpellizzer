                    <h1>Epidendrum vermifugum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum vermifugum, commonly known as the worm-eating orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its common name, "worm-eating," refers to its traditional use in herbal medicine for expelling intestinal parasites.</p>
<p>Epidendrum vermifugum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
