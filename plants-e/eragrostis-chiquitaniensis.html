                    <h1>Eragrostis chiquitaniensis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis chiquitaniensis, commonly known as the Chiquitania grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, often in areas with poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of wheat-like seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the regional flora and a valuable resource for local ecosystems.</p>
