                    <h1>Echinops bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Echinops bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Desert Thistle, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, which give it its scientific name. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Echinops bornmuelleri is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
