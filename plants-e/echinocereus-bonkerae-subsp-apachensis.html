<p>Echinocereus bonkerae subsp.</p>
<p>apachensis, commonly known as the Apache hedgehog cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, spine-tipped stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
