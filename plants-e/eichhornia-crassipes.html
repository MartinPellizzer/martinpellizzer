                <h1>Eichhornia crassipes</h1>
<p>Eichhornia crassipes, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy purple flowers, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has a rapid growth rate, often doubling its biomass within days, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, which can lead to eutrophication if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Water hyacinth is also used in phytoremediation to remove pollutants from water bodies.</p>
