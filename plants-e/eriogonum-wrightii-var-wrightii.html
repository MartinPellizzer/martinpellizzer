The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in California and Oregon, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
