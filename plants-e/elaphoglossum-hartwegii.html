                    <h1>Elaphoglossum hartwegii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
