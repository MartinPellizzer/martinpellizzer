                    <h1>Eudistemon humifusum</h1>
<p>Eudistemon humifusum, commonly known as the creeping daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eudistemon humifusum is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
