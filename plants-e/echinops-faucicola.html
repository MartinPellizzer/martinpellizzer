<p>Echinops faucicola, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble those of the echinops genus, though it belongs to the Malvaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
