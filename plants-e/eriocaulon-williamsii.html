                    <h1>Eriocaulon williamsii</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and reproductive strategies make it an important component of wetland biodiversity.</p>
