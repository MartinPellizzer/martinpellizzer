                    <h1>Evolvulus glomeratus var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Evolvulus glomeratus var. desertorum, commonly known as desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient component of xerophytic plant communities.</p>
