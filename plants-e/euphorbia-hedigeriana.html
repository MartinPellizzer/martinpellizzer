                    <h1>Euphorbia hedigeriana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hedigeriana, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its stem and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
