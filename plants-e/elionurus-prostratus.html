<p>Elionurus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate elionurus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens.</p>
