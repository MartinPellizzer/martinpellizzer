                    <h1>Elaphoglossum potamogeton</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum potamogeton, commonly known as the water holly fern, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its rhizomes spreading along the substrate. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a feathery appearance due to its finely divided fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum potamogeton plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
