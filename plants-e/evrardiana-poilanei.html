<p>Evrardiana poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant has a slender, upright stem and produces a single inflorescence with several showy blooms. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
