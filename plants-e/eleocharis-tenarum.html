<p>Eleocharis tenarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
