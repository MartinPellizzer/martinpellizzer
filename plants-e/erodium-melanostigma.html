<p>Erodium melanostigma, commonly known as blackseed bird's-beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along roadsides. It produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
