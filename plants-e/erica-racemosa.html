<p>Erica racemosa, commonly known as the heath or the common heather, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and evergreens adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple, during the summer months. Erica racemosa is well-suited to coastal and sandy environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
