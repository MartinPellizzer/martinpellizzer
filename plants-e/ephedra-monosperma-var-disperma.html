                    <h1>Ephedra monosperma var. disperma</h1>
<p>Ephedra monosperma var. disperma, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red-brown capsules that contain the seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it plays a significant role in desert ecosystems.</p>
