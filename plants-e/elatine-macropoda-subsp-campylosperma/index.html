                            <h1>Elatine Macropoda Subsp. Campylosperma</h1>
<p>Elatine macropoda subsp. campylosperma is a small aquatic plant commonly found in shallow, freshwater environments. It is known for its delicate, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters. This subspecies is often used as a bioindicator for water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Its tiny, clustered flowers add a unique charm to wetland ecosystems. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting aquatic life and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
