<p>Eria prainii, commonly known as the Prain's orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Eria prainii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens.</p>
