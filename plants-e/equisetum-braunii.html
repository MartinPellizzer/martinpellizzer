                    <h1>Equisetum braunii</h1>
<p>Equisetum braunii, commonly known as the black scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations at the top of the stem. Equisetum braunii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
