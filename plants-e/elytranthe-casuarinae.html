<p>Elytranthe casuarinae, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. It blooms during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions, it is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
