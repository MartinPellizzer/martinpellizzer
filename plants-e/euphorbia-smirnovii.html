                    <h1>Euphorbia smirnovii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia smirnovii, commonly known as the Smirnov's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its succulent tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils where other plants struggle to grow.</p>
