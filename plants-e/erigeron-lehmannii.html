<p>Erigeron lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The leaves are generally linear to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
