<p>Elephantella groenlandica var. surrecta, commonly known as the Greenlandic elephant plant, is a rare and unique species native to the Arctic regions of Greenland.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in harsh, cold environments with limited sunlight. The plant's leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in its arctic habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological significance in polar ecosystems.</p>
