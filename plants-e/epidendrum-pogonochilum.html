                    <h1>Epidendrum pogonochilum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum pogonochilum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red-tipped, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum pogonochilum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
