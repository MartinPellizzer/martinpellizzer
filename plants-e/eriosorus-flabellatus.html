                    <h1>Eriosorus flabellatus</h1>
<p>Eriosorus flabellatus, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous upright shoots, which contribute to its spreading growth habit.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
