                    <h1>Erica viscaria</h1>
<p>Erica viscaria, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Erica viscaria is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
