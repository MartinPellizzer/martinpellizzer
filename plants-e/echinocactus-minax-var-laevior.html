                    <h1>Echinocactus minax var. laevior</h1>
<p>Echinocactus minax var. laevior, commonly known as the Laevior Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, pale yellow to brown spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance choice for desert landscapes.</p>
