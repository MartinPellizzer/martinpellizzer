<p>Erythronium citrinum var. roderickii, commonly known as the Roderick's golden trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble small trilliums, and its distinctive, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a short growing season and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in its native range.</p>
