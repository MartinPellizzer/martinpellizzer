                    <h1>Eragrostis tenella var. plumosa</h1>
<p>Eragrostis tenella var. plumosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that are often covered with silky, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It forms dense, low-growing sod and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly used in turfgrass due to its limited cold hardiness and slow growth rate.</p>
