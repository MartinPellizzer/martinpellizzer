<p>Eleocharis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and damp soils.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, triangular stems with tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. Its leaves are grass-like and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
