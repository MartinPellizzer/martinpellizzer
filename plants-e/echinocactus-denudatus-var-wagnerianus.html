                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus var. wagnerianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus var. wagnerianus, commonly known as the Wagner's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
