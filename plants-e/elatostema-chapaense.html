<p>Elatostema chapaense, commonly known as the Chapa shield-leaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes plants known for their stinging hairs. The plant features small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Elatostema chapaense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
