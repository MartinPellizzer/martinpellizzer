<p>Euphorbia blatteri, commonly known as the Blatterâ€™s spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia blatteri is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
