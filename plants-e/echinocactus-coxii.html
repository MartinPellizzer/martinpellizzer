<p>Echinocactus coxii, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its striking appearance and drought tolerance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus coxii is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal care once established.</p>
