                    <h1>Eulophia ochobiensis</h1>
<p>Eulophia ochobiensis, commonly known as the Ochobiense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
