                    <h1>Elaterium</h1>
<p>Elaterium, commonly known as the blister beetle, is a plant that is not actually a plant at all, but rather a type of insect.</p>
<p>It is part of the family Meloidae and is known for secreting a toxic substance called cantharidin. This substance is used by the beetle as a defense mechanism against predators. The plant name Elaterium is sometimes mistakenly applied to the beetle due to historical confusion.</p>
<p>Despite the misclassification, the blister beetle remains an important subject in both entomology and toxicology.</p>
