<p>Euphorbia exigua subsp.</p>
<p>retusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
