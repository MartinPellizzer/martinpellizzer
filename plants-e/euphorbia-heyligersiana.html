<p>Euphorbia heyligersiana, commonly known as the Heyliger's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
