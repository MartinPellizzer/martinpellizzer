<p>Eriogonum brevicaule subsp.</p>
<p>leptothecum, commonly known as the slender-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>
