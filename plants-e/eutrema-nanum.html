<p>Eutrema nanum, commonly known as dwarf sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Eutrema nanum is often found in habitats such as dunes, salt marshes, and rocky shores.</p>
