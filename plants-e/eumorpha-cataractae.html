<p>Eumorpha cataractae, commonly known as the Guatemalan blue butterfly, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Eumorpha, which includes several species of large, colorful butterflies. The plant-related aspect of this butterfly is its association with specific host plants, primarily species of the genus Erythroxylum, which are part of the nightshade family. These plants provide the necessary nutrients for the butterfly's larvae to develop.</p>
<p>The relationship between Eumorpha cataractae and its host plants is an important ecological interaction in its native habitat.</p>
