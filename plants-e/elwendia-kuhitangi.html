                    <h1>Elwendia kuhitangi</h1>
<p>Elwendia kuhitangi, commonly known as the Kuhitangi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of native trees such as kahikatea and rimu, relying on them for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are edible for some bird species, contribute to seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Elwendia kuhitangi plays a unique role in the ecological balance of New Zealand's forests.</p>
