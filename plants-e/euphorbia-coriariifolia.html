                    <h1>Euphorbia coriariifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia coriariifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
