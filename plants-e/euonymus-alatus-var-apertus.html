                    <h1>Euonymus alatus var. apertus</h1>
<p>Euonymus alatus var. apertus, commonly known as the winged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>This variety is more open and less compact than the typical Euonymus alatus, making it suitable for hedging or as a specimen plant.</p>
