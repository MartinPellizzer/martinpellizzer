                    <h1>Euphorbia kotschyana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
