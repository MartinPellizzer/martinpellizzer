<p>Empetrum kardakovii, commonly known as the Kardak heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Empetrum kardakovii plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subarctic environments.</p>
