                    <h1>Euphorbia neoglaucescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neoglaucescens, commonly known as the Blue Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy blue-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia neoglaucescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
