<p>Echinocereus ctenoides, commonly known as the teddy bear cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers during the spring. The plant has a dense, branching structure that forms a shrub-like appearance, and its stems are typically green with a powdery coating. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and producing showy blooms to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The teddy bear cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
