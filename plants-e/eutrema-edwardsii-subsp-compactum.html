<p>Eutrema edwardsii subsp.</p>
<p>compactum, commonly known as the dwarf seaside spinach, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it tolerates saline and wind-swept conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments.</p>
