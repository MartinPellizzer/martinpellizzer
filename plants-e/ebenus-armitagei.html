<p>Ebenus armitagei, commonly known as the Armitage's euphorbia, is a rare and unusual plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Ebenus armitagei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
