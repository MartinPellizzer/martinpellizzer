<p>Eremosis tarchonanthifolia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Eremosis tarchonanthifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
