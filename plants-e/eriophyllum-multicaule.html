                    <h1>Eriophyllum multicaule</h1>
<p>Eriophyllum multicaule, commonly known as the common woolly sunflower, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, white to grayish foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and sand dune habitats.</p>
<p>Eriophyllum multicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
