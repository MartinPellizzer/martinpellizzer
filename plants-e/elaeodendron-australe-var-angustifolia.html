                    <h1>Elaeodendron australe var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Elaeodendron australe var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elaeodendron, is a variant of the native Australian plant Elaeodendron australe.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the stems rather than the leaves. It is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its limited distribution.</p>
