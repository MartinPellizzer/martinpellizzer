<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue or lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to desert and semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
