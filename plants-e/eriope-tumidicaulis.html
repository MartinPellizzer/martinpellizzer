                    <h1>Eriope tumidicaulis</h1>
<p>Eriope tumidicaulis, commonly known as the fat-stemmed eriope, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eriope tumidicaulis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
