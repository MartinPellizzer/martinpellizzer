                    <h1>Eurybia subspicata</h1>
<p>Eurybia subspicata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its distinctive, spiky blue to purple flower heads. The plant features silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline, windy habitat. Eurybia subspicata typically blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing showy, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
