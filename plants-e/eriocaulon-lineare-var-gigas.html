<p>Eriocaulon lineare var. gigas, commonly known as the giant threadleaf sedge, is a distinctive aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in the leaf axils. It thrives in wetland environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and wetland conservationists.</p>
