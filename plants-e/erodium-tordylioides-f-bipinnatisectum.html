<p>Erodium tordylioides f. bipinnatisectum, commonly known as the bipinnatisect erodium, is a variant of the common erodium, characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is often used in native plant gardens due to its unique texture and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and adaptability to dry conditions.</p>
