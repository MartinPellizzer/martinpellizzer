<p>Epilobium angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flowers appear in clusters at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Epilobium angustum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
