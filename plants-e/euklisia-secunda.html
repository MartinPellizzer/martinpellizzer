<p>Euklisia secunda, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and adapted for water storage, making it well-suited for drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euklisia secunda is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
