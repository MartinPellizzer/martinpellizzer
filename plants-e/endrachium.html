                    <h1>Endrachium</h1>
<p>Endrachium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its single, elongated flower that often appears above the foliage. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a unique structure called a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. Endrachium thrives in wet, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
