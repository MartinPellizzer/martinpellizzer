                    <h1>Eurystyles crocodilus</h1>
<p>Eurystyles crocodilus, commonly known as the crocodile fern, is a unique member of the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
