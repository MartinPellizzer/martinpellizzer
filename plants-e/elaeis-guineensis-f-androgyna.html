                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis f. androgyna</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis f. androgyna, commonly known as the androgynous oil palm, is a botanical variant of the oil palm characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Unlike typical oil palms, this form exhibits both male and female reproductive organs within the same flower, facilitating self-pollination. This trait is rare in palms and has significant implications for breeding and genetic diversity. The plant is primarily cultivated for its oil-rich fruits, which are used in food and industrial products.</p>
<p>Its androgynous nature makes it an important subject in botanical research and agricultural science.</p>
