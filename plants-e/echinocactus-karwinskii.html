<p>Echinocactus karwinskii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white bristles. The plant's most distinctive feature is its dense covering of golden-yellow spines, which give it its common name. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>This slow-growing cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
