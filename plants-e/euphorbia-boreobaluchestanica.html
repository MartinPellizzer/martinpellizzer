<p>Euphorbia boreobaluchestanica, commonly known as the Baluchestan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its ability to store water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia boreobaluchestanica is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
