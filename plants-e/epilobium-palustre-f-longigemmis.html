                    <h1>Epilobium palustre f. longigemmis</h1>
<p>Epilobium palustre f. longigemmis, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
