                    <h1>Eriachne compacta</h1>
<p>Eriachne compacta, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a small, tufted grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in compact, dense clusters, forming low mats or small clumps that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with small, pale brown flowers.</p>
<p>Eriachne compacta is well adapted to drought and heat, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
