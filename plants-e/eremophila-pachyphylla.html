<p>Eremophila pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thick, and often woolly foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to withstand long periods of drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Eremophila pachyphylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
