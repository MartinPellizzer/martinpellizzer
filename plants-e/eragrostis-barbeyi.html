<p>Eragrostis barbeyi, commonly known as the African lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis barbeyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock.</p>
