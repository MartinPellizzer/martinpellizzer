                    <h1>Echinocereus phoeniceus var. conoideus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus phoeniceus var. conoideus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of bright yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water quickly after rainfall.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in hot, dry climates.</p>
