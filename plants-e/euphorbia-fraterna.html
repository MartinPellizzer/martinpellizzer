                    <h1>Euphorbia fraterna</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fraterna, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it store water in its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
