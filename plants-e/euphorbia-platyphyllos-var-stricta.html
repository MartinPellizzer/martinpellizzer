                    <h1>Euphorbia platyphyllos var. stricta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, upright stem with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
