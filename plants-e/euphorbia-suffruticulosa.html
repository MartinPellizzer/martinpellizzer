                    <h1>Euphorbia suffruticulosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia suffruticulosa, commonly known as the silver bush or desert euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions with a deep root system and thick, fleshy stems for water storage.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
