                    <h1>Euphorbia cyparissias var. esuloides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cyparissias var. esuloides, commonly known as the curly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, greenish-yellow stems that have a distinctive curly, spiraled appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are typically followed by orange-red cyathia, the specialized inflorescence of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
