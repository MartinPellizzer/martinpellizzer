<p>Euphorbia begardii, commonly known as the Begard's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiny leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
