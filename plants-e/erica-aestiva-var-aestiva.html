                    <h1>Erica aestiva var. aestiva</h1>
<p>Erica aestiva var. aestiva, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Erica aestiva var. aestiva is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
