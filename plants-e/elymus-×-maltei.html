                    <h1>Elymus × maltei</h1>
<p>Elymus × maltei, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Elymus trachylobus and Elymus farctus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust growth and is often found in disturbed soils across the western United States. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It is notable for its high biomass production and potential use in forage and bioenergy applications.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds, which limits its natural spread but makes it valuable for cultivation purposes.</p>
