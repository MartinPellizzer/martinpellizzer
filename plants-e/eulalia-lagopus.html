                    <h1>Eulalia lagopus</h1>
<p>Eulalia lagopus, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Eulalia lagopus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
