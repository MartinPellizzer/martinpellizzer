                    <h1>Erodium cicutarium var. pusillum</h1>
<p>Erodium cicutarium var. pusillum, commonly known as smallhearted bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pithy, elongated capsule that splits open when mature to release the tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
