                    <h1>Eragrostis unionis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis unionis, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Botanically, Eragrostis unionis is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in restoration projects.</p>
