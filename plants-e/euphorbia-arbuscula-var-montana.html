                    <h1>Euphorbia arbuscula var. montana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arbuscula var. montana, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and sometimes covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
