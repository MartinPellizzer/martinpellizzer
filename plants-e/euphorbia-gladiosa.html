                    <h1>Euphorbia gladiosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gladiosa, commonly known as the swordleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
