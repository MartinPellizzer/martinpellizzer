<p>Echinochloa paludigena var. soluta, commonly known as the swamp grass or swampç¨—, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, floodplains, and other wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas, impacting native vegetation and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
