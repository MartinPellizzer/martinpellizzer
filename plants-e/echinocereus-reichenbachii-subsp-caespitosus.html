<p>Echinocereus reichenbachii subsp.</p>
<p>caespitosus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems that form a low-growing, mat-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
