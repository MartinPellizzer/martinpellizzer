                    <h1>Encephalartos caffer var. unidentatus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos caffer var. unidentatus, commonly known as the Cape umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen cycad-like plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, stout trunk with a dense, umbrella-shaped crown of glossy, dark green leaves. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into hard, spiny seed pods.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
