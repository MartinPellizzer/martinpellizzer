                    <h1>Euphorbia lacera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lacera, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with fleshy, often spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lacera is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
