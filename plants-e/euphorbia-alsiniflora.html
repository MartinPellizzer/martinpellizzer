<p>Euphorbia alsiniflora, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
