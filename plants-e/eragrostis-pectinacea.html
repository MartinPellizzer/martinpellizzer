                    <h1>Eragrostis pectinacea</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pectinacea, commonly known as silky grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, slightly hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark brown, three-angled seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
