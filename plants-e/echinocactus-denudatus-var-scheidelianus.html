                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus var. scheidelianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus var. scheidelianus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
