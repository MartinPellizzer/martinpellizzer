                    <h1>Euphorbia angulata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia angulata, commonly known as the angular spurge, is a succulent plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the variety.</p>
<p>Euphorbia angulata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
