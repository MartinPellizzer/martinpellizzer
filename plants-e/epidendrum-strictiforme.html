<p>Epidendrum strictiforme, commonly known as the rigid form epiphyte, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple.</p>
<p>Epidendrum strictiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
