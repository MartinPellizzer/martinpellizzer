<p>Elaphoglossum desireanum, commonly known as the Desirean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum desireanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
