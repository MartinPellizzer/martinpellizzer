<p>Epipactis palustris f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's inflorescence typically consists of a single, elongated spike bearing several flowers, which are often adorned with a greenish or brownish lip. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a unique morphology adapted to its moist, often shaded environment.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more typical greenish or brownish flowers of the main species.</p>
