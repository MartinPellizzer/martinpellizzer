                    <h1>Euphorbia sanguinea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sanguinea, commonly known as the red milkweed or blood euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sanguinea is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
