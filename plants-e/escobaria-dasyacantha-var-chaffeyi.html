                    <h1>Escobaria dasyacantha var. chaffeyi</h1>
<p>Escobaria dasyacantha var. chaffeyi, commonly known as Chaffey's hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that resemble a hedgehog. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
