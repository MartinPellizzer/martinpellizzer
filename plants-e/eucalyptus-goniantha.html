                    <h1>Eucalyptus goniantha</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus goniantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus goniantha is adapted to arid conditions and plays an important role in its native ecosystem.</p>
