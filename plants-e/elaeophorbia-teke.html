<p>Elaeophorbia teke, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Elaeophorbia teke is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain under study.</p>
