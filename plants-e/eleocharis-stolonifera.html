                    <h1>Eleocharis stolonifera</h1>
<p>Eleocharis stolonifera, commonly known as the spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Eleocharis stolonifera plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
