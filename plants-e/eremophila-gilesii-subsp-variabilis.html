<p>Eremophila gilesii subsp.</p>
<p>variabilis, commonly known as the variable eremophila, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought and full sun, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies exhibits variability in flower color and leaf morphology, which may be influenced by environmental conditions.</p>
