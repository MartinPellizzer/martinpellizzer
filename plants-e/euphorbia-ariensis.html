<p>Euphorbia ariensis, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with small, alternate leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its stem to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ariensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
