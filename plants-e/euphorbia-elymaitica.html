<p>Euphorbia elymaitica, commonly known as the Erythraean spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
