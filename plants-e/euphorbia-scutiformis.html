                    <h1>Euphorbia scutiformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia scutiformis, commonly known as the shield spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia scutiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
