                    <h1>Escobaria vivipara var. alversonii</h1>
<p>Escobaria vivipara var. alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's live-bearing prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by fleshy, red fruits that contain seeds. One of its most notable features is its viviparous reproduction, where seedlings develop on the fruit before it fully matures and detaches.</p>
<p>This adaptation helps the plant colonize harsh, arid environments by ensuring the survival of its offspring in favorable conditions.</p>
