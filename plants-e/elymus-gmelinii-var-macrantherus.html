                    <h1>Elymus gmelinii var. macrantherus</h1>
<p>Elymus gmelinii var. macrantherus, commonly known as the silvergrass or tundra grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with spikelets that are often clustered in groups, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
