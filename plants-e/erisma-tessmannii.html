<p>Erisma tessmannii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Erisma tessmannii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine invertebrates.</p>
