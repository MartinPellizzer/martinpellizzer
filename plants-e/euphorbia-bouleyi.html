<p>Euphorbia bouleyi, commonly known as the Bouley's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry environments by storing water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bouleyi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
