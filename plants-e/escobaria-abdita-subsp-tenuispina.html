<p>Escobaria abdita subsp.</p>
<p>tenuispina, commonly known as the slender-stemmed jointfoot, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush habitats.</p>
