                            <h1>Encyclia Meliosma</h1>
<p>Meliosma orchid, scientifically known as Encyclia meliosma, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This unique plant is celebrated for its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spectrum of white, pink, and lavender hues. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of rainforests where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its delicate appearance and ecological significance make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike. Despite its beauty, Encyclia meliosma faces threats from habitat destruction and over-collection, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare and enchanting plant.</p>
