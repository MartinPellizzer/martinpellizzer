<p>Erica viscaria subsp.</p>
<p>gallorum, commonly known as the Gallotus heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest.</p>
