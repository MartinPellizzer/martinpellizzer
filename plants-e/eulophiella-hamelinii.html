                    <h1>Eulophiella hamelinii</h1>
<p>Eulophiella hamelinii, commonly known as the Hamelin's lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that often appears as a dense, crust-like coating on rocks or soil surfaces. The lichen typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or on tree trunks. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health and biodiversity.</p>
