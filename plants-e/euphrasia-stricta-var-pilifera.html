The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it has hairy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host plants for nutrients, often found growing in association with grasses and sedges.</p>
