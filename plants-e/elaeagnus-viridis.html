                    <h1>Elaeagnus viridis</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus viridis, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage, which gives it its common name, and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species. It has a deep root system that makes it drought-tolerant and useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus viridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
