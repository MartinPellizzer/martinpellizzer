<p>Elaphandra moriana, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Elaphandra moriana thrives in humid, lowland forest environments and is often found in primary and secondary rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
