<p>It is characterized by its columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Echinopsis vatteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
