<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Eritrichium delicatulum is often found in rocky meadows and alpine tundra, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh ecosystems.</p>
