<p>Echinodorus ranunculoides f. natans, commonly known as the floating heart, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its leaves float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>This species is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life.</p>
