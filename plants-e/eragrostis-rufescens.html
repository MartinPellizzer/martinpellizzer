<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear in dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray appearance due to the presence of fine pubescence. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family.</p>
