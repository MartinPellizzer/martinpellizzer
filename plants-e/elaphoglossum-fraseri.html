<p>Elaphoglossum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum fraseri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare fern in its native habitat.</p>
