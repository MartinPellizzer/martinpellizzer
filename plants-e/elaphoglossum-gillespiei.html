                    <h1>Elaphoglossum gillespiei</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Elaphoglossum gillespiei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
