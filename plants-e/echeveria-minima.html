<p>Echeveria minima, commonly known as the miniature echeveria or baby echeveria, is a small, compact succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are typically no more than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
