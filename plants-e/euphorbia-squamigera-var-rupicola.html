                    <h1>Euphorbia squamigera var. rupicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia squamigera var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
