                    <h1>Eragrostis coelachyrum</h1>
<p>Eragrostis coelachyrum, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Blue grama is a key component of native grassland ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits.</p>
