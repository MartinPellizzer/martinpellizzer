                    <h1>Erica</h1>
<p>Erica, commonly known as heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, native to Europe, Africa, and South America.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs with small, evergreen leaves and are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils. Erica species produce bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, purple, and red, often blooming in late summer or early autumn. They are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and are also valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Many Erica species are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
