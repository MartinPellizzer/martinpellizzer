                    <h1>Eurotia</h1>
<p>Eurotia, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a cyanobacterium or algae.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic partnership between the two organisms. Eurotia plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
