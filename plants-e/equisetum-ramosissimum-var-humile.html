                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. humile</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. humile, commonly known as the small branch horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. It is a primitive plant that lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its spore-producing structures for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
