<p>Elaphoglossum aemulum, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus, which are often covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum aemulum is often found in temperate regions, thriving in woodland habitats with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
