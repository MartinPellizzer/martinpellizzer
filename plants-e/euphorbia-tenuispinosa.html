                    <h1>Euphorbia tenuispinosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tenuispinosa, commonly known as the narrow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, and its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and often reduced to spines. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
