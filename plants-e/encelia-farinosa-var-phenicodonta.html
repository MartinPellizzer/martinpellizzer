                    <h1>Encelia farinosa var. phenicodonta</h1>
<p>Encelia farinosa var. phenicodonta, commonly known as the Desert Encelia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, resinous leaves are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>The species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
