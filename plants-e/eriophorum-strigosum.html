<p>Eriophorum strigosum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and tundra, where it thrives in poor, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in unstable ground.</p>
<p>Eriophorum strigosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
