                    <h1>Eulophus cuspidatus</h1>
<p>Eulophus cuspidatus, commonly known as the cuspidate eulophus, is a species of gall wasp native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is known for inducing the formation of galls on the leaves of certain plants, particularly those in the rose family. The galls produced by this species are typically small, spherical, and covered in a layer of hardened plant tissue. These galls serve as both a protective structure and a food source for the developing wasp larvae.</p>
<p>The plant's interaction with Eulophus cuspidatus highlights the complex relationships between insects and their host plants in ecological systems.</p>
