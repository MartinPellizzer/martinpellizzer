                    <h1>Euphorbia eleanoriae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eleanoriae, commonly known as the Eleanoria's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia eleanoriae is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
