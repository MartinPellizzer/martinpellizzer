<p>Eriosyce villosa, commonly known as the hairy echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick base and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriosyce villosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care.</p>
