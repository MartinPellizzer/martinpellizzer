<p>Eresda alba, commonly known as the white eresda, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and also covered in a layer of fine pubescence.</p>
<p>Eresda alba is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
