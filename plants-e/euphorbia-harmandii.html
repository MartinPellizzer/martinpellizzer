<p>Euphorbia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in low-water environments make it a notable example of desert flora.</p>
