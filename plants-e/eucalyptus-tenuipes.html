                    <h1>Eucalyptus tenuipes</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus tenuipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which are clustered in groups of three. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus tenuipes is also valued for its aromatic oils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>
