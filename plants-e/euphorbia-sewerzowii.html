                    <h1>Euphorbia sewerzowii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sewerzowii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy epicuticular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is stored in the stem and leaves, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sewerzowii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
