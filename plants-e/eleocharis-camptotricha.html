<p>Eleocharis camptotricha, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis camptotricha plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
