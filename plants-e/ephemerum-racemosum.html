                    <h1>Ephemerum racemosum</h1>
<p>Ephemerum racemosum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ephemeral blooming cycle, where it only flowers for a short period during the summer months. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers arranged in racemes, which are often hidden among its dense foliage. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Ephemerum racemosum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
