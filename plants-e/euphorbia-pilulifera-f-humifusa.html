                    <h1>Euphorbia pilulifera f. humifusa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilulifera f. humifusa, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties.</p>
<p>This succulent is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
