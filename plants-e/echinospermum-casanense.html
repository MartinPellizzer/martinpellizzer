<p>Echinospermum casanense, commonly known as the Brazilian burr plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Echinospermum casanense is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
