<p>Euphorbia anachoreta, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia anachoreta is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
