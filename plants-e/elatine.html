                    <h1>Elatine</h1>
<p>Elatine, commonly known as water starwort, is a genus of small aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Elatinaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in wet environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream sides, where they thrive in moist soil or shallow water. Elatine species are characterized by their tiny, often green or reddish, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They have a rapid growth rate and can form dense mats, which help prevent erosion in water bodies.</p>
<p>Some species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
