                    <h1>Eleocharis subtilis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis subtilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Eleocharis subtilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
