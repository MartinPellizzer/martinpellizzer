<p>Euphorbia adenoptera subsp.</p>
<p>gundlachii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant in its native habitat.</p>
