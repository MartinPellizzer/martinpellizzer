                    <h1>Erigeron glacialis var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Erigeron glacialis var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
