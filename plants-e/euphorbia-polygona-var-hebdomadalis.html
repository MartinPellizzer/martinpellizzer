                    <h1>Euphorbia polygona var. hebdomadalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polygona var. hebdomadalis, commonly known as the Seven-day euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
