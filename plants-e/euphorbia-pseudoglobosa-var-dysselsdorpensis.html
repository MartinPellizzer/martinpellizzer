                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudoglobosa var. dysselsdorpensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudoglobosa var. dysselsdorpensis, commonly known as the Dysselsdorp euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
