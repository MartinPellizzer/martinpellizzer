<p>Echinocactus dolichacanthus var. minor, commonly known as the small-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, sharp spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in arid landscapes.</p>
