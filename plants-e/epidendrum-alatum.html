<p>Epidendrum alatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or orange lip, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Epidendrum alatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment.</p>
