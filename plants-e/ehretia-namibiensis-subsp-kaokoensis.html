<p>Ehretia namibiensis subsp.</p>
<p>kaokoensis, commonly known as the Kaoko ehretia, is a small shrub native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the brief rainy season. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with branches that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme aridity and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
