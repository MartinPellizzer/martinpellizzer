<p>Erica pannosa, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet, acidic environments of western Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer.
