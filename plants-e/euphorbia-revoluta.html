<p>Euphorbia revoluta, commonly known as the curly spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, twisted stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
