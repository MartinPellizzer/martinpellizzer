                    <h1>Echinocactus platyceras var. minax</h1>
<p>Echinocactus platyceras var. minax, commonly known as the dwarf golden barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiny exterior with a pale green to yellowish hue, and its ribs are short and rounded. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its textured surface. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments.</p>
