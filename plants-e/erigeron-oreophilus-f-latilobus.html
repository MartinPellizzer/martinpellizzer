<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is generally covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
