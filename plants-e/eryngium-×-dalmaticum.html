                    <h1>Eryngium × dalmaticum</h1>
<p>Eryngium × dalmaticum, commonly known as the Dalmatian thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistle blooms. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often considered invasive in parts of North America due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though care must be taken to prevent its escape into natural habitats.</p>
