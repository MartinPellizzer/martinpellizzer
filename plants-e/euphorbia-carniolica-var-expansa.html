                    <h1>Euphorbia carniolica var. expansa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia carniolica var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
