                    <h1>Elytraria scorpioides</h1>
<p>Elytraria scorpioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf seepweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the coast, often in saline or brackish environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
