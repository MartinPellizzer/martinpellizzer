                    <h1>Empleurum unicapsularis</h1>
<p>Empleurum unicapsularis, commonly known as the single-celled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders that are used for trapping prey. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are attached to slender, thread-like stems. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an interesting subject in the study of aquatic botany.</p>
