                    <h1>Euphorbia mellifera var. canariensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mellifera var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
