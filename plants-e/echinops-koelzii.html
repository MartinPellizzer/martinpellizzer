                    <h1>Echinops koelzii</h1>
<p>Echinops koelzii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant has small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Echinops koelzii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to its harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
