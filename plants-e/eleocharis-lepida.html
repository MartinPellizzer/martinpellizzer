<p>Eleocharis lepida, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Eleocharis lepida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
