<p>Eragrostis velutina, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Africa, including South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Velvetgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
