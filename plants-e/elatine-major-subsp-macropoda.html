<p>Elatine major subsp.</p>
<p>macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often near the water's surface. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate varying water conditions, it is considered a common and widespread species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
