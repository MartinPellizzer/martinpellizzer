                    <h1>Eleocharis plantaginoides</h1>
<p>Eleocharis plantaginoides, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, making it a common component of marsh and pond ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
