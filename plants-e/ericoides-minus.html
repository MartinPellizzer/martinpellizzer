                    <h1>Ericoides minus</h1>
<p>Ericoides minus, commonly known as the lesser heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. Ericoides minus thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
