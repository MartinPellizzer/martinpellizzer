<p>Eugenia xerophytica, commonly known as the desert guava, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its fruit is a small, round berry that changes color from green to red as it matures.</p>
<p>Eugenia xerophytica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, low-moisture conditions.</p>
