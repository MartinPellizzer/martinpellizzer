                    <h1>Echinocactus occultus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus occultus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are typically produced at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echinocactus occultus is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
