<p>Eremostachys subspicata, commonly known as the spiked eremostachys, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
