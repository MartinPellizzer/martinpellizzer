                    <h1>Eucalyptus bowmanii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus bowmanii, commonly known as the bowman's gum, is a tall, slender eucalyptus native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, make it valuable in medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to dry, inland environments and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.</p>
