<p>Eragrostis patentissima, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides.</p>
