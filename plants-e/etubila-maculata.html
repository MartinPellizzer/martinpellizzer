                    <h1>Etubila maculata</h1>
<p>Etubila maculata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, round spots or markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are concealed within its foliage, making it a unique example of fern morphology.</p>
<p>Etubila maculata is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
