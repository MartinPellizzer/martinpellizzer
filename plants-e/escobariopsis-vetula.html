                    <h1>Escobariopsis vetula</h1>
<p>Escobariopsis vetula, commonly known as the Florida rock tamarisk, is a small, perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Escobariopsis vetula is often found in coastal dunes and limestone habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
