                    <h1>Euphorbia martinae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia martinae, commonly known as the Martin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia martinae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
