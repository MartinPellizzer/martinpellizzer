                    <h1>Euphorbia clava</h1>
<p>Euphorbia clava, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous spiny, fleshy branches that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia clava is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
