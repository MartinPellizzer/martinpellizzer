<p>Erica frondosa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 12 to 18 inches, with dense, compact foliage composed of tiny, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica frondosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
