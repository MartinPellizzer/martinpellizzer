                    <h1>Enekbatus dualis</h1>
<p>Enekbatus dualis, commonly known as the twin-leaf fern, is a rare species native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds, which consist of two main leaflets that split into smaller, delicate segments. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are fibrous and capable of producing new shoots, contributing to its slow but steady growth.</p>
<p>The twin-leaf fern is also notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation projects.</p>
