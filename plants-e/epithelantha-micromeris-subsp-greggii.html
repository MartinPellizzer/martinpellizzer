<p>Epithelantha micromeris subsp.</p>
<p>greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's ghost flower, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly bristles.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical E. micromeris.</p>
