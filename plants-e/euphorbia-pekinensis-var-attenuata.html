                    <h1>Euphorbia pekinensis var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pekinensis var. attenuata, commonly known as the Peking spurge or slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, green stems that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in succulent gardens.</p>
