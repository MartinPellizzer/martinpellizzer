                    <h1>Echinops virgatus</h1>
<p>Echinops virgatus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny seed heads that resemble small globes, which are composed of numerous bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive seed heads that persist through the winter. Echinops virgatus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a valuable component of desert ecosystems.</p>
