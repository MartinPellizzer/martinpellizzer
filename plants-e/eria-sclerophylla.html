                    <h1>Eria sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Eria sclerophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed eria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
