<p>Euphorbia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalen's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium.
