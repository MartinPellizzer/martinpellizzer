<p>Erophila radians, commonly known as the golden waxy plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, Erophila radians is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
