                    <h1>Elaphoglossum propinquum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum propinquum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, linear pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum propinquum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
