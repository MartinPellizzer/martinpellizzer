<p>Erica monticola, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Erica monticola is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal plant due to its tolerance of harsh environmental conditions.</p>
