                    <h1>Euphorbia bessarabica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bessarabica, commonly known as the Bessarabian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it often has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bessarabica is adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in steppe or semi-desert habitats.</p>
