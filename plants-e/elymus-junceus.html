                    <h1>Elymus junceus</h1>
<p>Elymus junceus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Elymus junceus is also valued for its potential in forage and as a bioindicator species in ecological studies.</p>
