                    <h1>Eriocephalus affinis</h1>
<p>Eriocephalus affinis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are oppositely arranged and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriocephalus affinis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
