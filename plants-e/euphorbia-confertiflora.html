                    <h1>Euphorbia confertiflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
