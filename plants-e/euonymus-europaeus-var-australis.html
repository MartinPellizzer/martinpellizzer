<p>Euonymus europaeus var. australis, commonly known as the European spurge or winter acorn.</p>
<p>This variant is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. The plant is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, and it has a moderate growth rate.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent fruits.</p>
