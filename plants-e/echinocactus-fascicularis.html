<p>Echinocactus fascicularis, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
