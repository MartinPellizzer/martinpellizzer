                    <h1>Equisetum arvense f. diffusum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense f. diffusum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is commonly found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats.</p>
