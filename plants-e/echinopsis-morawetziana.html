                    <h1>Echinopsis morawetziana</h1>
<p>Echinopsis morawetziana, commonly known as the Morawetzian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and botanical collections.</p>
