                    <h1>Elephantorrhiza obliqua var. glabra</h1>
<p>Elephantorrhiza obliqua var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions.</p>
