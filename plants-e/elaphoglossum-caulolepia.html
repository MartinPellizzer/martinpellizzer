                    <h1>Elaphoglossum caulolepia</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum caulolepia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
