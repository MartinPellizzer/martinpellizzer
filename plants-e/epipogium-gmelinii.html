                    <h1>Epipogium gmelinii</h1>
<p>Epipogium gmelinii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are often hidden within the leaf litter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which are essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
