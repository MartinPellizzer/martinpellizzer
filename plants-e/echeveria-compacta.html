                <h1>Echeveria compacta</h1>
<p>Echeveria compacta, commonly known as the compact echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense, rounded rosette of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically gray-green in color with a slight bluish tint. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements.</p>
