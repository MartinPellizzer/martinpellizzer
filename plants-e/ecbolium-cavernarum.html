                    <h1>Ecbolium cavernarum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium cavernarum, commonly known as the cave bladderworts, is a rare aquatic plant found in subterranean water systems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its specialized leaves that function as bladders to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its leaf structures for nutrient absorption. It thrives in dark, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in caves or underground streams.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important indicator species for underground ecosystems.</p>
