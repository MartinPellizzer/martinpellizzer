                    <h1>Epiblastus kerigomnensis</h1>
<p>Epiblastus kerigomnensis, commonly known as the Kerigomnese epiblast, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the cloud forests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features dense, velvety foliage with a unique iridescent sheen, which helps it capture and retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a combination of white and pale yellow hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epiblastus kerigomnensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
