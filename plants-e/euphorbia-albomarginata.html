<p>Euphorbia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling when cultivated.</p>
