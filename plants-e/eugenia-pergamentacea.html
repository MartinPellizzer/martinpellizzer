                    <h1>Eugenia pergamentacea</h1>
<p>Eugenia pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it its common name, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
