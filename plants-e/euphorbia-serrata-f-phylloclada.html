                    <h1>Euphorbia serrata f. phylloclada</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serrata f. phylloclada, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that are often mistaken for leaves, a feature typical of many euphorbias. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short peduncles. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
