                    <h1>Euphoria exstipulata</h1>
<p>Euphoria exstipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Euphoria exstipulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
