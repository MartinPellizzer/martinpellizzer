                    <h1>Euphorbia brevirama var. supraterra</h1>
<p>Euphorbia brevirama var. supraterra, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its hardy nature and minimal care requirements.</p>
