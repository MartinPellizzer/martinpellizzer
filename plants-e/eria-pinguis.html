<p>Eria pinguis, commonly known as the fat lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology, including its swollen leaf bases, helps it store water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eria pinguis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
