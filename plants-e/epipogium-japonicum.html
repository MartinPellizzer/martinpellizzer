                    <h1>Epipogium japonicum</h1>
<p>Epipogium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often hidden within the leaf litter. It is native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia, growing in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
