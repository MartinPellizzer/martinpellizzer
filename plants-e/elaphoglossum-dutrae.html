                    <h1>Elaphoglossum dutrae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Elaphoglossum dutrae is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
