<p>Eleocharis valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to South America, particularly found in the temperate regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
<p>Eleocharis valdiviana is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
