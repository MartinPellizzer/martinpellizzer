<p>Echinocactus gibbosus var. ferox, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
