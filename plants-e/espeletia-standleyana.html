<p>Espeletia standleyana, commonly known as the "Snowy Mountain" or "Cushion Plant," is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that forms a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Espeletia standleyana is also known for its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
