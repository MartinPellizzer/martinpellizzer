<p>Elettariopsis stoloniflora, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground through horizontal stems. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Elettariopsis stoloniflora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats.</p>
