                    <h1>Elaphoglossum viscosum var. minus</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum viscosum var. minus, commonly known as the sticky holly fern, is a variant of the sticky holly fern, characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family, which includes various ferns with complex spore-producing organs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a waxy, sticky surface that aids in water retention and protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a key feature in fern reproduction.</p>
