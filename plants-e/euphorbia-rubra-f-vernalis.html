                    <h1>Euphorbia rubra f. vernalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rubra f. vernalis, commonly known as the spring euphorbia, is a compact, low-growing plant with a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a fleshy, cylindrical stem that is typically reddish in color, which helps it store water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and often reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>This succulent thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
