<p>Eremothera pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf eremothera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its small size and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Eremothera pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
