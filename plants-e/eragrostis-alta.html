<p>Eragrostis alta, commonly known as tall lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis alta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
