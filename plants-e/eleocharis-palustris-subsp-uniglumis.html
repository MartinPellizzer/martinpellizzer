<p>Eleocharis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>uniglumis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and marsh ecosystems. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
