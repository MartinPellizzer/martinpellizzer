                    <h1>Echinopogon</h1>
<p>Echinopogon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny, bristly leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that often bloom in shades of blue or purple. Echinopogon species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline or well-drained environments. They are often used in coastal restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Echinopogon tetraphyllus, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
