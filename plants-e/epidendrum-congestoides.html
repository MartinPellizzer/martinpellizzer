                    <h1>Epidendrum congestoides</h1>
<p>Epidendrum congestoides, commonly known as the clustered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green, broad, and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum congestoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
