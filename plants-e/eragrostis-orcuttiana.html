<p>Eragrostis orcuttiana, commonly known as the Orcutt's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and restoration projects.</p>
