                    <h1>Equisetum × jesupii</h1>
<p>Equisetum × jesupii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often found in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
