<p>Elaphoglossum doanense, commonly known as the Doan's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with finely divided pinnae, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
