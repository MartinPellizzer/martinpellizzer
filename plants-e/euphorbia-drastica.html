                    <h1>Euphorbia drastica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia drastica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to extreme heat and minimal rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia drastica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
