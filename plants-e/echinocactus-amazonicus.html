                    <h1>Echinocactus amazonicus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to its humid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the wet season, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in cacti to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus amazonicus plays a role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various small animals.</p>
