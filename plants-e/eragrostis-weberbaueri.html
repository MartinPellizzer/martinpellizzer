                    <h1>Eragrostis weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Eragrostis weberbaueri, commonly known as Weberbauer's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Eragrostis weberbaueri is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
