<p>Euphorbia collina var. nahuelhuapina, commonly known as the Nahuelhuapi euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower structures, typically appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
