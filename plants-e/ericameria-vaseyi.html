                    <h1>Ericameria vaseyi</h1>
<p>Ericameria vaseyi, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Ericameria vaseyi plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
