                    <h1>Ecbolium verticillare</h1>
<p>Ecbolium verticillare, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and some insects. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Ecbolium verticillare plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
