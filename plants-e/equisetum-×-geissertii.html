                    <h1>Equisetum × geissertii</h1>
<p>Equisetum × geissertii, commonly known as the hybrid horse tail, is a sterile fern-like plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Equisetum ramosissimum and Equisetum hyemale, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant features whorled branches and small, scale-like leaves, typical of the equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its non-flowering nature, it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
