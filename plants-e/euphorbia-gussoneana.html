<p>Euphorbia gussoneana, commonly known as the Gussone's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia gussoneana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
