                    <h1>Eragrostis angolensis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis angolensis, commonly known as Angola lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eragrostis angolensis is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
