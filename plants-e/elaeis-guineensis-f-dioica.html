                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis f. dioica</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis f. dioica, commonly known as the dioecious oil palm, is a botanical variant of the oil palm characterized by its separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>This form exhibits distinct morphological differences, with male plants typically having shorter petioles and female plants displaying more robust inflorescences. The species is native to tropical regions of Africa and is cultivated for its high oil yield from its fruit. Its dioecious nature influences pollination dynamics, as cross-pollination between male and female plants is necessary for fruit development.</p>
<p>Due to its unique reproductive system, it plays a significant role in the genetic diversity and cultivation practices of oil palm agriculture.</p>
