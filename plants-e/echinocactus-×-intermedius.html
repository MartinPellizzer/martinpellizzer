<p>Echinocactus × intermedius, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a hybrid species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny areoles that bear white to yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
