                    <h1>Eucalyptus arachnaea</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus arachnaea, commonly known as the misty gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a greyish or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
