<p>Euonymus heterophylus, commonly known as the variable euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others deeply lobed, depending on the growing conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 that split open to release seeds. Its adaptability to different environments makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to urban conditions.</p>
