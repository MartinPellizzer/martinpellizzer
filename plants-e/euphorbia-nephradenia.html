<p>Euphorbia nephradenia, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nephradenia is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
