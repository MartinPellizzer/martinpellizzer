<p>Echinocactus crenatus, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is covered in spines that provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne at the base of the stem. Echinocactus crenatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a striking addition to desert gardens.</p>
