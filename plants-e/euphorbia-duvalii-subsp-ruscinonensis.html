<p>Euphorbia duvalii subsp.</p>
<p>ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Corsican spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
