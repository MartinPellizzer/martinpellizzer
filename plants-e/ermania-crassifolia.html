<p>Ermania crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ermania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, often borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
