                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. erectum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. erectum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in challenging environments make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
