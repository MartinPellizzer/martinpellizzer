                    <h1>Eriocaulon miserum var. mitophylum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon miserum var. mitophylum, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in dense clusters. This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America and Eurasia.</p>
