                    <h1>Epidendrum antenniferum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum antenniferum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are usually yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum antenniferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
