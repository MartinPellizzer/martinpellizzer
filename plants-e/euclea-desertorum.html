                    <h1>Euclea desertorum</h1>
<p>Euclea desertorum, commonly known as the desert euclea, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to protect against desiccation.</p>
<p>Euclea desertorum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
