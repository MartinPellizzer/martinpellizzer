<p>Eugenia oblata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often narrower than those of other Eugenia species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red when mature, though it is not widely cultivated for consumption.</p>
