<p>[WRONG START] Embilia ribes subsp.</p>
<p>pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved embelia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
