<p>Echinocactus ceratistes, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny exterior, which provides protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
