                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudosororia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudosororia, commonly known as the false spurge or desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters, known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
