<p>Euodia elleryana var. pilosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are orange to red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
