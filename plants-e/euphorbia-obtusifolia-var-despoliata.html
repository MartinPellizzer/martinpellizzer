                    <h1>Euphorbia obtusifolia var. despoliata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia obtusifolia var. despoliata, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
