<p>Euphorbia ankarensis, commonly known as the Ankarensis spurges, is a succulent plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
