                    <h1>Erica pomifera</h1>
<p>Erica pomifera, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Erica pomifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
