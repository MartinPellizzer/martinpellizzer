                    <h1>Eucalyptus raveretiana var. jerichoensis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus raveretiana var. jerichoensis, commonly known as the Jericho eucalyptus, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are usually pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
