<p>Euphorbia mitchelliana var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a shallow root system adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its survival in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
