<p>Erigeron remyi, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Its blue to purple flower heads bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Erigeron remyi is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
