                    <h1>Epilobium tundrarum</h1>
<p>Epilobium tundrarum, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and rocky areas. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Epilobium tundrarum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for herbivores and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
