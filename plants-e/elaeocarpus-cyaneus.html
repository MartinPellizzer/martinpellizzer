<p>Elaeocarpus cyaneus, commonly known as the blue tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces striking blue-black fruits that are encased in a fleshy, yellowish pulp. These fruits are typically consumed by various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
