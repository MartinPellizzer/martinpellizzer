<p>Echinops vaginatus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which give it its common name. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Echinops vaginatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
