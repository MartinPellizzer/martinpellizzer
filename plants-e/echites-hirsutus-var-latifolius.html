<p>Echites hirsutus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf echites, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that further aids in moisture retention. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
