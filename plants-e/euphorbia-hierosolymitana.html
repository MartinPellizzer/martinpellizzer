                    <h1>Euphorbia hierosolymitana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hierosolymitana, commonly known as the Jerusalem spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
