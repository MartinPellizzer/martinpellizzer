                            <h1>Eriogonum Deflexum Subsp. Baratum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum baratum, scientifically known as Eriogonum deflexum subsp. baratum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and ecologically important plant.</p>
