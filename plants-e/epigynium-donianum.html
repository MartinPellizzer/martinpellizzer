<p>Epigynium donianum, commonly known as the Donian epigynium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are unique, with the flowers and fruits borne on the upper part of the stem, a feature common in many members of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
