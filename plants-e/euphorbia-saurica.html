                    <h1>Euphorbia saurica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia saurica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in the summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and store moisture. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia saurica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
