                    <h1>Equisetum variegatum var. meridionale</h1>
<p>Equisetum variegatum var. meridionale, commonly known as the southern variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green with a faintly yellowish tint. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Equisetum. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form of Equisetum variegatum and is native to southern regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
