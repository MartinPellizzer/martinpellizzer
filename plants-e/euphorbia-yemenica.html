<p>Euphorbia yemenica, commonly known as the Yemen spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Yemen.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces a unique type of inflorescence called a cyathium, which consists of a cup-shaped structure surrounded by modified leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its stems and having a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia yemenica is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
