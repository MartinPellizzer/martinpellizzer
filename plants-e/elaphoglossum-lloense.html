<p>Elaphoglossum lloense, commonly known as the Lloense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
