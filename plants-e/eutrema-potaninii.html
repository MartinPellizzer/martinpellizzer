<p>Eutrema potaninii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The species is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Eutrema potaninii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
