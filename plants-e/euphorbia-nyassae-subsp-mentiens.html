<p>Euphorbia nyassae subsp.</p>
<p>mentiens, commonly known as the Mentienâ€™s euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
