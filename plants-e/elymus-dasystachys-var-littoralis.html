<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. It is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological resilience and ability to colonize disturbed coastal areas.</p>
