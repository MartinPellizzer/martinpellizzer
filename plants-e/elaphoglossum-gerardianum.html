<p>Elaphoglossum gerardianum, commonly known as the Gerard's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
