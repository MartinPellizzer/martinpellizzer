<p>Echinodorus ridleyi, commonly known as the red-leaf waterweed, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to purple leaves and its ability to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has long, slender stems that often root at the base, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it float and resist water currents.</p>
<p>Echinodorus ridleyi is popular in aquariums for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining water quality.</p>
