                    <h1>Eragrostis scaligera</h1>
<p>Eragrostis scaligera, commonly known as the hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis scaligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
