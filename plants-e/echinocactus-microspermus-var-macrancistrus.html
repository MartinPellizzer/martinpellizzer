                    <h1>Echinocactus microspermus var. macrancistrus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus microspermus var. macrancistrus, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for arid gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
