The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia abdulghafooriana is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions.</p>
