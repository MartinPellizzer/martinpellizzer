                    <h1>Encephalartos vanhallii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos vanhallii, commonly known as the Van Hall's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, fan-like arrangement of leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its arid habitat. This cycad produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Encephalartos vanhallii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
