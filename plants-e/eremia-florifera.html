                    <h1>Eremia florifera</h1>
<p>Eremia florifera, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eremia florifera has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, desert climates.</p>
