                    <h1>Excentradenia propinqua</h1>
<p>Excentradenia propinqua, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts.</p>
