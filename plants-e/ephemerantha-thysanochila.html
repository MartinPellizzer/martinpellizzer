                    <h1>Ephemerantha thysanochila</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha thysanochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
