                    <h1>Ebenus grisebachii</h1>
<p>Ebenus grisebachii, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to store water in its leaves make it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Ebenus grisebachii is often found in steppes and desert margins, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
