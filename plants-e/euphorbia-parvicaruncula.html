                    <h1>Euphorbia parvicaruncula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia parvicaruncula, commonly known as the dwarf bristly spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
