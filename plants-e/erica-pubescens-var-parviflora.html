<p>Erica pubescens var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the autumn and winter seasons. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
