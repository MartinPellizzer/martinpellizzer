                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. affine</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. affine, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, ribbed stems.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are covered with whorls of tiny, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions.</p>
