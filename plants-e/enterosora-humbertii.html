                    <h1>Enterosora humbertii</h1>
<p>Enterosora humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's enterospora, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and develops specialized structures called haustoria to attach to its host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host species thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but can impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
