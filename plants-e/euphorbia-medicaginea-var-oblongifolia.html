                    <h1>Euphorbia medicaginea var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia medicaginea var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, oblong leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a dense, fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
