<p>Elymus sajanensis subsp.</p>
<p>villosus, commonly known as the Sajan hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its subspecific name "villosus.". Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
