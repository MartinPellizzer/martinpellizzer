                    <h1>Eragrostis orthoclada</h1>
<p>Eragrostis orthoclada, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Eragrostis orthoclada is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
