                    <h1>Elymus angustiformis</h1>
<p>Elymus angustiformis, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Elymus angustiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
