                    <h1>Elatostema cauliflorum</h1>
<p>Elatostema cauliflorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in a cauliflorous pattern, meaning they grow directly on the stems rather than the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Elatostema cauliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
