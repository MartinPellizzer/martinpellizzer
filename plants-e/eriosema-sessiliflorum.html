<p>Eriosema sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flower eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear the same soft, hairy texture as the stems.</p>
<p>Eriosema sessiliflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
