                    <h1>Eumachia oleoides</h1>
<p>Eumachia oleoides, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Eumachia oleoides is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
