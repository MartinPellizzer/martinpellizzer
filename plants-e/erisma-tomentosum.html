<p>Erisma tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly eriska, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands or along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Erisma tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
