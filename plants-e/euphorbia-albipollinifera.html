                    <h1>Euphorbia albipollinifera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia albipollinifera, commonly known as the white-pollen euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its white pollen is a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Euphorbia albipollinifera is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
