                    <h1>Eragrostis petraea</h1>
<p>Eragrostis petraea, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis petraea is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments, often growing on slopes and in crevices where other plants struggle to establish.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
