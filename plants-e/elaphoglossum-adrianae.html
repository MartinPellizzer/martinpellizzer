                    <h1>Elaphoglossum adrianae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum adrianae, commonly known as the Adriana holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
