                    <h1>Eleocharis acuta var. platylepis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis acuta var. platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it often forms dense colonies in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical var. acuta.</p>
