                    <h1>Erythroxylum nitidum var. glaucum</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum nitidum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue-hair coca, is a species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces elliptical, blue-black berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its glaucous (waxy, bluish) coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment.</p>
