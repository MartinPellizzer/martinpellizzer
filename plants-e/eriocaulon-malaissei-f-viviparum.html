                    <h1>Eriocaulon malaissei f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon malaissei f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. One of its notable features is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in its dispersal and survival in wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
