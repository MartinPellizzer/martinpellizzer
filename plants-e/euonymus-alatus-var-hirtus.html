                    <h1>Euonymus alatus var. hirtus</h1>
<p>Euonymus alatus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy-winged burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy along the veins, giving it its varietal name "hirtus.". The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its leaves and its seasonal color changes make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats.</p>
