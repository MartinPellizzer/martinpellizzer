<p>Empetrum scoticum, commonly known as Scottish heath.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the British Isles and parts of Scandinavia. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in harsh climates. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but somewhat tart.</p>
<p>Empetrum scoticum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorland environments.</p>
