<p>Endocomia macrocoma subsp.</p>
<p>longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spineless leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
