                    <h1>Euphorbia roseana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia roseana, commonly known as the rose thorn or rose spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in spiny, reddish-brown tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia roseana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique morphology and hardy nature.</p>
