                    <h1>Euphorbia radyeri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia radyeri, commonly known as the Desert Rose or White-spotted Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
