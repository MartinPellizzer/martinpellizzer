                <h1>Euxolus blitum</h1>
<p>Euxolus blitum, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has finely divided leaves and is typically found in slow-moving or still water. It thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, relying on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptations to aquatic habitats.</p>
