<p>Ephippianthus schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's ephippium, is a rare and elusive plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its flowering period typically occurs during the rainy season, and it is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ephippianthus schmidtii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
