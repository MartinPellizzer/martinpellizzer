                    <h1>Epithelantha densispina</h1>
<p>Epithelantha densispina, commonly known as the dense spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Epithelantha densispina is well-suited to xerophytic environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
