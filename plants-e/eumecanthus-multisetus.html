<p>Eumecanthus multisetus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, triangular pods that split open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Eumecanthus multisetus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
