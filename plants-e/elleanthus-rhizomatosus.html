                    <h1>Elleanthus rhizomatosus</h1>
<p>Elleanthus rhizomatosus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and are usually green or brown in color.</p>
