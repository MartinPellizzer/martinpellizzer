<p>Eria lochongensis, commonly known as the Lochong orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Eria lochongensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
