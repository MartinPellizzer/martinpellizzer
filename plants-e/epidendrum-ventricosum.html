                    <h1>Epidendrum ventricosum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum ventricosum, commonly known as the swollen-ventricle epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often swollen pseudobulbs that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Epidendrum ventricosum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
