<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a whitish, scaly coating. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
