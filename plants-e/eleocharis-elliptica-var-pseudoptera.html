<p>Eleocharis elliptica var. pseudoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted for efficient water dispersion and survival in fluctuating water levels.</p>
