<p>Encyclia gilbertoi, commonly known as Gilbert's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color.</p>
<p>Encyclia gilbertoi is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
