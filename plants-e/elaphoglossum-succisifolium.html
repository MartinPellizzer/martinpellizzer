<p>Elaphoglossum succisifolium, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear moss-like, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum succisifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
