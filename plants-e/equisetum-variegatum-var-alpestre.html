                    <h1>Equisetum variegatum var. alpestre</h1>
<p>Equisetum variegatum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine basket sedge, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and small, spore-bearing cones. This variant is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it exhibits a unique morphology adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in alpine ecosystems.</p>
