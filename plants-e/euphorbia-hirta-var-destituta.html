                    <h1>Euphorbia hirta var. destituta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hirta var. destituta, commonly known as the "Indian spurge" or "buttercup spurge," is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is considered a potential allergen and should be handled with care.</p>
