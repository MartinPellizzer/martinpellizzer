<p>Elaphoglossum hernandeziae, commonly known as the Hernandez's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
