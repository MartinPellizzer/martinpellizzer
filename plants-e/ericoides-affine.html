                    <h1>Ericoides affine</h1>
<p>Ericoides affine, commonly known as the smooth ericoid, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, adapted to withstand the harsh, saline conditions of its coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Ericoides affine is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
