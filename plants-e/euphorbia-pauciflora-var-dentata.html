                    <h1>Euphorbia pauciflora var. dentata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pauciflora var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The leaves are usually small, spiny, and often have a serrated or toothed margin, which gives the variety its name. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
