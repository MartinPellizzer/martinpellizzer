                    <h1>Eriocaulon arenicola</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon arenicola, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a small perennial herb native to coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tiny, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon arenicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
