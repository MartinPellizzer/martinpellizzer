<p>Eriophorum maximowiczii, commonly known as the tundra cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, contributing to the floral diversity of its cold climate habitat.</p>
