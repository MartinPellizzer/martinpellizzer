                    <h1>Encephalartos altensteinii var. grandis</h1>
<p>Encephalartos altensteinii var. grandis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, robust leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, arranged in a tight rosette. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with a single, large, spiky cone, which is a distinctive feature of the genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
