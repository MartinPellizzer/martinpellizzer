                    <h1>Euphorbia herrei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia herrei, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and slightly hairy, adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia herrei is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
