                    <h1>Epipogium guilfoylii</h1>
<p>Epipogium guilfoylii, commonly known as the Guilfoyle's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is typically found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, often growing in dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
