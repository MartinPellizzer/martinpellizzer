                    <h1>Euphorbia lurida</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lurida, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lurida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
