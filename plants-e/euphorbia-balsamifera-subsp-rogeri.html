<p>Euphorbia balsamifera subsp.</p>
<p>rogeri, commonly known as the Roger's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
