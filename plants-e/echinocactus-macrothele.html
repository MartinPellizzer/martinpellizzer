<p>Echinocactus macrothele, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 3 meters under optimal conditions. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinocactus macrothele is well adapted to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
