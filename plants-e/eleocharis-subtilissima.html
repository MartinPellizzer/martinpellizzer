                    <h1>Eleocharis subtilissima</h1>
<p>Eleocharis subtilissima, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that contribute to soil stabilization. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetlands.</p>
