                    <h1>Euphorbia orbiculifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia orbiculifolia, commonly known as the orbiculate euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its adaptations to drought include reduced leaf size and the ability to store water in its stem.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
