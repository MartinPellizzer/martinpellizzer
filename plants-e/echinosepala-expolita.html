<p>Echinosepala expolita, commonly known as the spiny-sepaled plant, is a unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyx that encases the flower, which is a notable botanical feature. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in shaded, moist habitats. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
