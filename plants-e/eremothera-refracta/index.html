                            <h1>Eremothera Refracta</h1>
<p>Eremothera daisy, scientifically known as Eremothera refracta, is a hardy perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This resilient species is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in hot, dry climates with minimal water requirements. Its striking white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, adding a touch of elegance to rocky landscapes and disturbed soils. The plant's common name reflects its ability to withstand extreme conditions, making it a symbol of endurance in the desert. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, Eremothera refracta is a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
