<p>Euphorbia pilulifera, commonly known as the pill bug euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces unique, rounded, bead-like structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pilulifera is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
