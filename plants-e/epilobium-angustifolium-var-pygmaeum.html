<p>Epilobium angustifolium var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact size compared to the typical form of Epilobium angustifolium.</p>
