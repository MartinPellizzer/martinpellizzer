<p>Euphorbia helenae subsp.</p>
<p>grandifolia, commonly known as the Greek spurge or Helen's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
