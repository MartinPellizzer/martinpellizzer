<p>Eremospatha suborbicularis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
