                    <h1>Eriogonum umbellatum var. aridum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum umbellatum var. aridum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy and rocky soils in its native range.</p>
