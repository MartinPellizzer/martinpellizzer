                    <h1>Elaphoglossum tanganjicense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum tanganjicense, commonly known as the Tanganyika holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
