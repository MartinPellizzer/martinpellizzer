                    <h1>Eriogonum umbellatum var. chlorothamnus</h1>
<p>Eriogonum umbellatum var. chlorothamnus, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, hairy, and arranged in a compact rosette, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, spherical seed pods that contain numerous seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats.</p>
