                            <h1>Erigeron Acris Var. Major</h1>
<p>Erigeron acris var. major is a flowering plant native to North America known for its delicate blue to purple daisy-like blooms. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows and prairies where it spreads via its creeping root system. This variant is distinguished by its larger flower heads and broader leaves compared to the typical form of Erigeron acris. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish successfully.</p>
