<p>Echinocactus courantii, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its spines are short and yellow, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus courantii is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
