                    <h1>Euphorbia opaca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia opaca, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment.</p>
<p>Euphorbia opaca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
