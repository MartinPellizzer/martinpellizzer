<p>Elaphoglossum mickelianum, commonly known as the Mickelian holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically measure between 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, often protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
