<p>Eragrostis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a species of annual grass native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
