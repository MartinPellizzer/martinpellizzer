<p>Epidendrum lansbergii, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Epidendrum lansbergii is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
