                    <h1>Eriophorum russeolum var. majus</h1>
<p>Eriophorum russeolum var. majus, commonly known as the tall tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flowering heads that are surrounded by bracts, and it typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant forms tussocks due to its rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
