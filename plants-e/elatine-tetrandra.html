<p>Elatine tetrandra, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has tiny, green, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering impurities.</p>
<p>Elatine tetrandra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
