<p>Erica puberula, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Erica puberula thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in coastal areas due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
