                    <h1>Euphorbia rossii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rossii, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features striking, bright orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem covered in soft, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
