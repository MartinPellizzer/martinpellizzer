                    <h1>Epipactis alba f. spicata</h1>
<p>Epipactis alba f. spicata, commonly known as the white helleborine with spicate inflorescence, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage and distinctive spicate arrangement of flowers, which differ from the typical racemose inflorescence of the species. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
