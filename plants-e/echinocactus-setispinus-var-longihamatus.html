                    <h1>Echinocactus setispinus var. longihamatus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus setispinus var. longihamatus, commonly known as the long-needle hedgehog cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
