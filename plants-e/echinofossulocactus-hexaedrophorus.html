                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus hexaedrophorus</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus hexaedrophorus, commonly known as the six-sided hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, ribbed stems that are covered in short, white spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
