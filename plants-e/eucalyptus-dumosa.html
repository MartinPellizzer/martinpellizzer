                    <h1>Eucalyptus dumosa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus dumosa, commonly known as the woolly eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey or white foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is usually smooth and peels off in strips, revealing a mottled pattern beneath.</p>
