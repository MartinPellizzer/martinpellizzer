<p>Euryops subcarnosus subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats.</p>
