<p>Eriocaulon lhotskyi, commonly known as the Lhotsky's spike-moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, leafy stems that often form compact cushions. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth or slightly rough surface. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on moss morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
