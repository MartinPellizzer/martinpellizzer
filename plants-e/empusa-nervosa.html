                    <h1>Empusa nervosa</h1>
<p>Empusa nervosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that anchor it to its host and absorb water and nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and are borne in clusters, while its berries are red and contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Empusa nervosa is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitats.</p>
