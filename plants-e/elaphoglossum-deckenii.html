                    <h1>Elaphoglossum deckenii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum deckenii, commonly known as the Decken's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant's rhizomes are usually short and horizontal, supporting its growth habit.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
