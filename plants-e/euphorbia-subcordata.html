<p>Euphorbia subcordata, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are fleshy and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted for storing water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia subcordata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
