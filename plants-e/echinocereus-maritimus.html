                    <h1>Echinocereus maritimus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus maritimus, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California and the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Echinocereus maritimus plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for desert wildlife.</p>
