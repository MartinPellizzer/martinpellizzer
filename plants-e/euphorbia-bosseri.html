<p>Euphorbia bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its waxy leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bosseri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
