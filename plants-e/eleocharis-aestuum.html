                    <h1>Eleocharis aestuum</h1>
<p>Eleocharis aestuum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis aestuum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate both standing water and periodic drought.</p>
