<p>Equisetum curvifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaf scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinctive, hollow stem that lacks true leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the apex of the stem.</p>
