                    <h1>Elaphoglossum fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
