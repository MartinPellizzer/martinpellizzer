                    <h1>Euonymus nanoides</h1>
<p>Euonymus nanoides, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its dense, ground-covering growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental planting in shaded areas.</p>
