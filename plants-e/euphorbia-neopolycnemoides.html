                    <h1>Euphorbia neopolycnemoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neopolycnemoides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
