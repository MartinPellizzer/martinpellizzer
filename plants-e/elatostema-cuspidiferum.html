                    <h1>Elatostema cuspidiferum</h1>
<p>Elatostema cuspidiferum, commonly known as the needleleaf elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences, while its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Elatostema cuspidiferum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role within its native habitats.</p>
