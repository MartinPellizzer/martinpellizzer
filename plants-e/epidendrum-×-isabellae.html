<p>Epidendrum × isabellae, commonly known as the Isabellae Epidendrum, is a hybrid orchid that combines traits from its parent species.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture.</p>
<p>This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in moderate light conditions.</p>
