                    <h1>Echites lanatus</h1>
<p>Echites lanatus, commonly known as the hairy echites, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Echites lanatus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
