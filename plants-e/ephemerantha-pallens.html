                    <h1>Ephemerantha pallens</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and its delicate, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
