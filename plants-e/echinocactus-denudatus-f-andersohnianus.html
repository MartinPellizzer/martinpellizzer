                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus f. andersohnianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus f. andersohnianus, commonly known as the Andersohn's naked echinocactus, is a unique variant of the species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced spines and smooth, greenish-gray stems, which distinguish it from the typical echinocactus. The plant forms a solitary, globular caudex with a short stem, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
