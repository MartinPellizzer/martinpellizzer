                    <h1>Echinocactus wislizeni var. lecontei</h1>
<p>Echinocactus wislizeni var. lecontei, commonly known as the Leconte's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its resilience and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
