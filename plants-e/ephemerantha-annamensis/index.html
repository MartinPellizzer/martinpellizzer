                            <h1>Ephemerantha Annamensis</h1>
<p>Annam orchid, scientifically known as Ephemerantha annamensis, is a rare and captivating species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. This delicate flowering plant is renowned for its ephemeral blooms, which only last a few days before fading. Despite its short-lived flowers, the Annam orchid holds significant ecological value in its native habitat. Its unique characteristics make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, the Annam orchid faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
