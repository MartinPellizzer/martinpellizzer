<p>Escallonia alpina var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering.</p>
