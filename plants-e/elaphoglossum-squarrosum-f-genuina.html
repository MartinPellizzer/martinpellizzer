<p>Elaphoglossum squarrosum f. genuina, commonly known as the Genuina Shield Fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology and ecological preferences.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like shape, giving it its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the genus Elaphoglossum.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
