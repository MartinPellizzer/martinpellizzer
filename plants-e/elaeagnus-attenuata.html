<p>Elaeagnus attenuata, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, reddish berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus attenuata is also known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
