                    <h1>Equisetum × dycei</h1>
<p>Equisetum × dycei, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile plant that results from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and the presence of whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant retains the typical features of horsetails, including the production of spore-bearing structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
