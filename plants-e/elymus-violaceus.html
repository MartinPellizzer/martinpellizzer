                    <h1>Elymus violaceus</h1>
<p>Elymus violaceus, commonly known as purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming clumps that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, violet-tinged florets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Elymus violaceus is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and along rocky slopes.</p>
