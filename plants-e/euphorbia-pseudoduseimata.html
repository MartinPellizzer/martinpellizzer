                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudoduseimata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudoduseimata, commonly known as the false dune euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pseudoduseimata is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
