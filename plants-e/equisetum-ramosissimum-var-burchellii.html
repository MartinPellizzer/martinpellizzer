                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. burchellii</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. burchellii, commonly known as Burchell's horse-tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a tall, spore-bearing stem that emerges in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait shared with other ancient plant species.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its evolutionary history as one of the oldest lineages of land plants.</p>
