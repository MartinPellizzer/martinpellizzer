                            <h1>Erysimum Laxum</h1>
<p>Common wallflower, scientifically known as Erysimum laxum, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in well-drained soils and full sun. With its bright yellow flowers and low-growing habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its modest appearance, the common wallflower plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
