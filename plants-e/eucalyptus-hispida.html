                <h1>Eucalyptus hispida</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus hispida, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale green or yellowish, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>
