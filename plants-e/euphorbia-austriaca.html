                    <h1>Euphorbia austriaca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
