                    <h1>Eriocaulon glaucum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon glaucum, commonly known as the blue rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that often appears bluish-green due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon glaucum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
