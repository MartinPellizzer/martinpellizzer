<p>Elymus repens subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots make it a persistent weed in many ecosystems.</p>
