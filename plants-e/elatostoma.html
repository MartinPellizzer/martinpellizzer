                    <h1>Elatostoma</h1>
<p>Elatostoma, commonly known as the sun compass fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Elatostomataceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, shield-shaped fronds that open during the day and close at night, a response to light and temperature changes. The fronds are typically small, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, kidney-shaped appearance. Elatostoma species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Their ability to respond to environmental stimuli makes them an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
