                    <h1>Echinopanax horridus</h1>
<p>Echinopanax horridus, commonly known as the rough echinopanax, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several lobes and covered in a dense layer of stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
