                    <h1>Empetrum nigrum f. hermaphroditum</h1>
<p>Empetrum nigrum f. hermaphroditum, commonly known as the hermaphroditic crowfoot, is a variant of the common crowfoot, characterized by its bisexual flowers.</p>
<p>This form exhibits both male and female reproductive structures within the same flower, a trait known as monoecy. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in rocky or heathland environments. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a sharp, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that are evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature in harsh climates.</p>
