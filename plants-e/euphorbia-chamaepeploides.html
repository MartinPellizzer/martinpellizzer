                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaepeploides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaepeploides, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing clumps of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in dry landscapes.</p>
