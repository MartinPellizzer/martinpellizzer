<p>Eria oreophylax, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Eria oreophylax is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
