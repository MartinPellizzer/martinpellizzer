<p>Enckea articulata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its use in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds.</p>
