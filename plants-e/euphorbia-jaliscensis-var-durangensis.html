                    <h1>Euphorbia jaliscensis var. durangensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia jaliscensis var. durangensis, commonly known as the Durango euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the highlands of Durango, Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
