                    <h1>Epidendrum deltogastropodium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum deltogastropodium, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, yellow-orange flowers that have a distinctive lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
