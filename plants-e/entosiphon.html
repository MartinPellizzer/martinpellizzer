<p>Entosiphon, commonly known as the "false holly," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their opposite, often spiny leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red. Entosiphon species are adapted to arid environments and have a symbiotic relationship with ants, which help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
