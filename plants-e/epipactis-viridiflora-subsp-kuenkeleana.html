<p>Epipactis viridiflora subsp.</p>
<p>kuenkeleana, commonly known as the Kuenkeleâ€™s green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
