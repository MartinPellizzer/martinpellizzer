                    <h1>Erythremia aphylla</h1>
<p>Erythremia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless erythranthe, is a unique member of the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a few small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stem. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it is adapted to arid environments and is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
