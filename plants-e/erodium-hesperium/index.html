                            <h1>Erodium Hesperium</h1>
<p>Erodium hesperium, commonly known as common stormweed, is a small annual plant native to western North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open areas. The plant has small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread quickly across different habitats. Despite being considered a weed, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
