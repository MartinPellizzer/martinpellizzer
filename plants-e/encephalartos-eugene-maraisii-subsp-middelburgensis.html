<p>Encephalartos eugene-maraisii subsp.</p>
<p>middelburgensis, commonly known as the Middelburg cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spiny female cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
