                    <h1>Euphorbia gerardiana var. dentata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gerardiana var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
