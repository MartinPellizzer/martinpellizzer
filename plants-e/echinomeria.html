                    <h1>Echinomeria</h1>
<p>Echinomeria, commonly known as the "Mexican honeycomb," is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky, spherical flower heads that resemble a honeycomb, which is a key botanical feature. Echinomeria species typically belong to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and are known for their showy, brightly colored blooms. They often grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to dry conditions with their succulent leaves and compact growth form.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Echinomeria baileyi and Echinomeria grayii, which are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
