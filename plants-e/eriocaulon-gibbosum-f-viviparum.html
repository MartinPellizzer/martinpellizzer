                    <h1>Eriocaulon gibbosum f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon gibbosum f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is notable for its viviparous trait, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
