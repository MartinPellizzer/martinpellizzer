                    <h1>Eucalyptus oleosa var. borealis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus oleosa var. borealis, commonly known as the northern eucalyptus, is a variant of the eucalyptus genus native to the colder regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin sheets. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a silvery underside, which helps reduce water loss in its cooler, drier habitats. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale pink, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
