                    <h1>Erythraea gypsicola</h1>
<p>Erythraea gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, particularly those rich in gypsum. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Erythraea gypsicola is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
