                    <h1>Eleocharis nuda</h1>
<p>Eleocharis nuda, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Eleocharis nuda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
