                    <h1>Euphorbia atlantica var. villosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia atlantica var. villosa, commonly known as the Atlantic euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its waxy leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, providing protection from intense sunlight and salt spray.</p>
<p>This resilient species is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
