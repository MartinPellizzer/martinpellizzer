<p>Echinocactus raphidacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny areoles that cover its surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green exterior. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
