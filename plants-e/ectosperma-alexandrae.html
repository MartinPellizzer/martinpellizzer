                    <h1>Ectosperma alexandrae</h1>
<p>Ectosperma alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's spikerush, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in cold, oligotrophic waters and is adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering structures emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ectosperma alexandrae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
