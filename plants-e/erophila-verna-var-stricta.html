                    <h1>Erophila verna var. stricta</h1>
<p>Erophila verna var. stricta, commonly known as the early bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded or partially shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research.</p>
