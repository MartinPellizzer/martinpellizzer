<p>Euphorbia armstrongiana var. distans, commonly known as the Armstrong's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>It is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
