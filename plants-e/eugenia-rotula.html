                    <h1>Eugenia rotula</h1>
<p>Eugenia rotula, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The fruit is a small, round drupe with a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. The wood of Eugenia rotula is highly valued for its density, durability, and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
