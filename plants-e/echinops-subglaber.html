<p>Echinops subglaber, commonly known as the hairless thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, though the species name "subglaber" suggests a reduction in hair compared to other echinops species.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
