                    <h1>Eremocarya micrantha var. pseudolepida</h1>
<p>Eremocarya micrantha var. pseudolepida, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
