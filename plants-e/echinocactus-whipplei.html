<p>Echinocactus whipplei, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is covered in bright yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in arid landscapes.</p>
