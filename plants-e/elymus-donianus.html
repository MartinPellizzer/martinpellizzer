                    <h1>Elymus donianus</h1>
<p>Elymus donianus, commonly known as the Donian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus donianus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying mountain ecosystems.</p>
