                    <h1>Euphorbia viscoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia viscoides, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, green stems covered in a sticky, waxy substance that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
