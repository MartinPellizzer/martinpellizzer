                    <h1>Eatonia longiflora</h1>
<p>Eatonia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered evergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in local herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Eatonia longiflora is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
