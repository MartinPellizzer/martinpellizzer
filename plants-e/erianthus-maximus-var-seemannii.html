                    <h1>Erianthus maximus var. seemannii</h1>
<p>Erianthus maximus var. seemannii, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, and its stems are often hollow and jointed. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
