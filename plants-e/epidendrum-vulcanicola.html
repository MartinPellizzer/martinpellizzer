                    <h1>Epidendrum vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Epidendrum vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in disturbed or volcanic landscapes. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It is a pseudobulbous species, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Epidendrum vulcanicola is often found growing in shaded, humid environments near lava flows or in rocky areas.</p>
