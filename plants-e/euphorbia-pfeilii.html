                    <h1>Euphorbia pfeilii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pfeilii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive branched stem structure that resembles a candlestick, with a thick, fleshy trunk and branching arms. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are small, spine-tipped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pfeilii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its stems and exhibiting a slow growth rate to conserve resources.</p>
