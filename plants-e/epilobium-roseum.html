<p>Epilobium roseum, commonly known as the pink willow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, willow-like stems covered in fine, silky hairs. Its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Epilobium roseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
