                    <h1>Eucalyptus nigrifunda</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus nigrifunda, commonly known as the black-veined eucalypt, is a species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a tall tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are long and narrow, with a distinctive dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its timber and has some medicinal uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other eucalypt species.</p>
