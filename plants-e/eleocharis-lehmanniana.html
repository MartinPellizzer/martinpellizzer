<p>Eleocharis lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's spike rush, is a species of sedge native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help in preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis lehmanniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits.</p>
