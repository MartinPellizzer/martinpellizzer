<p>Encyclia serroniana, commonly known as the serrated orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with three petals and three sepals, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
