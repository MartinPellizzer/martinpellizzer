<p>Escobaria dasyacantha, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment.</p>
<p>Escobaria dasyacantha is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
