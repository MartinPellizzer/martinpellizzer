<p>Echinocereus coccineus subsp.</p>
<p>aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered nightblooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines.</p>
