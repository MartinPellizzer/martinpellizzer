                    <h1>Erica erosa</h1>
<p>Erica erosa, commonly known as the sand heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its profusion of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. Erica erosa is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
