<p>Elaphoglossum sessile, commonly known as the sessile holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum sessile thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of temperate and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
