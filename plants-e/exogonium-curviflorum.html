                    <h1>Exogonium curviflorum</h1>
<p>Exogonium curviflorum, commonly known as the curlflower, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which is known for its modified leaves called cataphylls. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of small flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers arranged in different zones on the spadix.</p>
<p>This botanical feature contributes to its role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
