<p>Espeletiopsis insignis, commonly known as the Colombian mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Espeletiopsis insignis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
