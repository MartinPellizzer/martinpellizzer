                    <h1>Encephalartos lehmannii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feather-like leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its arid habitat. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, a characteristic feature of cycads.</p>
<p>It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in the cycad trade.</p>
