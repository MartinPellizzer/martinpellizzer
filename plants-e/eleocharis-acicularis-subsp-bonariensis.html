<p>Eleocharis acicularis subsp.</p>
<p>bonariensis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its reproductive structures consist of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dark brown achenes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
