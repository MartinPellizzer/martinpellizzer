<p>Eremophila platycalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved emu bush, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grey-green foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to drought conditions with its hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a calyx that remains attached to the plant.</p>
<p>Eremophila platycalyx is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
