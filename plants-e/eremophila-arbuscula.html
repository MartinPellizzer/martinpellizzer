<p>Eremophila arbuscula, commonly known as the stork's bill, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Eremophila arbuscula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water gardens.</p>
