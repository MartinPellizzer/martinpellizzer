<p>Echinocereus enneacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>intermedius, commonly known as the Intermediate Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to gray spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
