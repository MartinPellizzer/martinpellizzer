<p>Euphorbia villosissima, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation.</p>
