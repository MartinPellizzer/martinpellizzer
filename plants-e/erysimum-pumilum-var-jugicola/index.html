<p>Alpine wallflower, scientifically known as Erysimum pumilum var. jugicola, is a hardy plant that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it adapts to harsh weather conditions. This species is characterized by its compact growth and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly resilient and can survive in rocky and poor soil. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a notable subject in botanical studies.</p>
