                    <h1>Eriogonum subalpinum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>
