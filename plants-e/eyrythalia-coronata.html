<p>Eyrythalia coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
