<p>Euphorbia pseudomollis, commonly known as the ghostplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
