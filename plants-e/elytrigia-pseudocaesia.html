<p>Elytrigia pseudocaesia, commonly known as the false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in soils with moderate to low fertility.</p>
<p>Elytrigia pseudocaesia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
