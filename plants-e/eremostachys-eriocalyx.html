                    <h1>Eremostachys eriocalyx</h1>
<p>Eremostachys eriocalyx, commonly known as the woolly eryngo, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Eremostachys eriocalyx is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited precipitation.</p>
