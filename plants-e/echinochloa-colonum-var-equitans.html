<p>Echinochloa colonum var. equitans, commonly known as horse grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, often branching stalks and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower spikelet being shorter and more compact. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and morphology make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural contexts.</p>
