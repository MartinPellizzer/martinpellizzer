                    <h1>Eucalyptus caliginosa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus caliginosa, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that often peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought tolerant, making it a hardy species in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus caliginosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for native wildlife.</p>
