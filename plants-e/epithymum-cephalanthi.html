<p>Epithymum cephalanthi, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Epithymum cephalanthi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions.</p>
