                    <h1>Elephantorrhiza</h1>
<p>Elephantorrhiza, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often branched roots that resemble the legs of an elephant, hence its common name. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Elephantorrhiza is well adapted to arid environments and can store water in its roots to survive long dry periods.</p>
