                    <h1>Euphorbia tardieuana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tardieuana, commonly known as the late-flowering spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens.</p>
