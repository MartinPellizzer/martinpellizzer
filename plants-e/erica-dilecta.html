                    <h1>Erica dilecta</h1>
<p>Erica dilecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple during the spring and summer months. Erica dilecta is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
