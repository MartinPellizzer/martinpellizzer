                    <h1>Eleocharis plantaginea var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Eleocharis plantaginea var. stolonifera, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, white to pale green spikelets that are clustered at the tips of the stems. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
