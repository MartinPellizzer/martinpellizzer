                    <h1>Ephedra vulgaris var. submonostachya</h1>
<p>Ephedra vulgaris var. submonostachya, commonly known as the narrow-staminal ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from other ephedra species due to its unique floral structure and reduced stamen number.</p>
