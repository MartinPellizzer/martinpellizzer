<p>Eminia benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguella thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Eminia benguellensis is valued for its resilience and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
