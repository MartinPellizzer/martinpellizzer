                    <h1>Euphorbia somalensis var. nogalensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia somalensis var. nogalensis, commonly known as the Somali spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Somalia and southern Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often ribbed and can store water, adapting it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and growth habit compared to other Euphorbia species.</p>
