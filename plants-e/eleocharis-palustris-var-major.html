                    <h1>Eleocharis palustris var. major</h1>
<p>Eleocharis palustris var. major, commonly known as the greater spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in phytoremediation, as it can absorb heavy metals and pollutants from contaminated water.</p>
