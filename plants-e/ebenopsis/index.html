                            <h1>Ebenopsis</h1>
<p>Ironwood, scientifically known as Ebenopsis, is a resilient and ancient tree native to the southeastern United States. This hardy species is renowned for its dense, durable wood that has been used by indigenous peoples for centuries. Despite its name, Ironwood is not a true ironwood but is named for its exceptionally strong and heavy timber. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, Ironwood is considered a valuable but endangered species in many regions.</p>
