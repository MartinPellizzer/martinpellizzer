<p>Euphorbia delicatissima, commonly known as the delicate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are narrow and often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
