                    <h1>Echinops pannosus</h1>
<p>Echinops pannosus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a globe, which are composed of numerous small, dry fruits. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Echinops pannosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
