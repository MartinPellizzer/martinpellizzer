                    <h1>Euphorbia venteri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia venteri, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent plant native to Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often spine-tipped, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia venteri is well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
