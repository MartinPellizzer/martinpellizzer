                    <h1>Erythraea diffusa</h1>
<p>Erythraea diffusa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its bark and roots contain compounds that have been traditionally used for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
