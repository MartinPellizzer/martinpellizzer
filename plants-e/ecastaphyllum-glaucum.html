                    <h1>Ecastaphyllum glaucum</h1>
<p>Ecastaphyllum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue-green thallus, which is rich in photosynthetic pigments. The lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on limestone or sandstone. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungus.</p>
<p>This species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to lichenologists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
