                    <h1>Excoecaria biglandulosa var. moritziana</h1>
<p>Excoecaria biglandulosa var. moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's spurge, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features smooth, succulent stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>
