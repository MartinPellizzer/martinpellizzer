<p>Elephas orientalis, commonly known as the oriental elephant, is a large herbivorous mammal native to the forests and grasslands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive body, long trunk, and large ears, which aid in thermoregulation. The plant refers to the elephant's habitat, which includes a variety of vegetation such as grasses, shrubs, and trees. Elephas orientalis plays a crucial role in shaping its ecosystem through seed dispersal and vegetation modification.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss and poaching.</p>
