                    <h1>Elatine glomerata</h1>
<p>Elatine glomerata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, white or pink flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Elatine glomerata is also notable for its ability to survive in both freshwater and brackish environments.</p>
