<p>Elaphoglossum simplex var. martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds with a distinct, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
