<p>Eriophorum confertissimum, commonly known as tussock grass or cotton grass, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those in bogs and wet meadows. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, leafless stems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eriophorum confertissimum is also notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
