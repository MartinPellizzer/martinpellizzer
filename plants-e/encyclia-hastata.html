<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often dry or seasonally wet habitat.

<p>Encyclia hastata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
