<p>Echinocactus ottonis var. spinosior, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal care once established.</p>
