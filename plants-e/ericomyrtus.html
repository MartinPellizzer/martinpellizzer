                    <h1>Ericomyrtus</h1>
<p>Ericomyrtus, commonly known as the mistletoe plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host trees while also performing photosynthesis. Ericomyrtus species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Australia and New Caledonia. Their small, often clustered leaves and fragrant flowers make them distinctive.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or horticulture.</p>
