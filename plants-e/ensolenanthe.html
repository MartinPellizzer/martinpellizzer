                    <h1>Ensolenanthe</h1>
<p>Ensolenanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, pine rockland habitats and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Ensolenanthe is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
