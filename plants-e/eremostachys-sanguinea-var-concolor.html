<p>Eremostachys sanguinea var. concolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy or rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear, gray-green in color, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
