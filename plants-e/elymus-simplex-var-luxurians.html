                    <h1>Elymus simplex var. luxurians</h1>
<p>Elymus simplex var. luxurians, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
