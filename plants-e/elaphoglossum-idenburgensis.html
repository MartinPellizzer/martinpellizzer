<p>Elaphoglossum idenburgensis, commonly known as the Idenburg's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, circular sori. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
