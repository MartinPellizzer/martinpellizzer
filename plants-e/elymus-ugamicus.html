                    <h1>Elymus ugamicus</h1>
<p>Elymus ugamicus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Elymus ugamicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor, arid conditions.</p>
