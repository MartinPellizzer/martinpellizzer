                    <h1>Euphorbia heteropodum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia heteropodum, commonly known as the "Crown of Thorns," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia heteropodum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
