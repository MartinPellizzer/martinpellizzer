<p>Eleocharis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis wrightii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions.</p>
