                    <h1>Elaphoglossum lagesianum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum lagesianum, commonly known as the Lagesian holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and evolutionary adaptation.</p>
