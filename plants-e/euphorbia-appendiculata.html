                    <h1>Euphorbia appendiculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which can be toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is adapted to survive in environments with limited water availability.</p>
