                    <h1>Euphorbia andina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia andina, commonly known as the Andean spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a woody base and can grow up to several feet tall, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Euphorbia andina is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
