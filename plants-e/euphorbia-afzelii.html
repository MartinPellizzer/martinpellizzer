<p>Euphorbia afzelii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia afzelii contains a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among many euphorbias.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
