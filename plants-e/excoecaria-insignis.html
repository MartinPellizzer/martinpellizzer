<p>Excoecaria insignis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it survive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that allow it to anchor itself in shallow coastal waters. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a reddish tinge, and it produces small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation in coastal environments.</p>
