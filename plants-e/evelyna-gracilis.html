The plant produces pale lavender flowers that bloom at night, releasing a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Evelyna gracilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
