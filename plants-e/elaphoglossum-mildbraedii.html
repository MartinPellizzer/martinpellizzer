<p>Elaphoglossum mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
