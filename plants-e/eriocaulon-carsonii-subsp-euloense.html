<p>Eriocaulon carsonii subsp.</p>
<p>euloense, commonly known as the Eulo Eriocaulon, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a compact rosette structure that helps it anchor in soft substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
