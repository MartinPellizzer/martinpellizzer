                    <h1>Eydouxia</h1>
<p>Eydouxia, commonly known as the golden grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Eydouxia species are characterized by their tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, clustered inflorescences that often have a yellow or golden hue, giving the genus its common name.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance, Eydouxia plants are often used in landscaping and erosion control in dry climates.</p>
