                    <h1>Eulophia guamensis</h1>
<p>Eulophia guamensis, commonly known as the Guam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. The plant produces strikingly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, white, and purple, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it benefits from high humidity and filtered sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Eulophia guamensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
