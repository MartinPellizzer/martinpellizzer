                    <h1>Euphorbia terracina var. alexandrina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia terracina var. alexandrina, commonly known as the Alexandrine spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
