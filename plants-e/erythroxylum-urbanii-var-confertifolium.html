                    <h1>Erythroxylum urbanii var. confertifolium</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum urbanii var. confertifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved erythroxylum, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which later develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
