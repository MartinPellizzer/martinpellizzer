                    <h1>Effusiella dilatata</h1>
<p>Effusiella dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a flat, leaf-like structure with a greenish-yellow upper surface and a pale, leathery underside. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
