                    <h1>Euphorbia bonae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bonae, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, a swollen stem base that stores water, and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bonae is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
