<p>Euphorbia dentata var. cuphosperma, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with a caudex, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
