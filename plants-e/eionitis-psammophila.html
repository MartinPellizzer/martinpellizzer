                    <h1>Eionitis psammophila</h1>
<p>Eionitis psammophila, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. This species is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water and nutrients. Its structure is typically crust-like, allowing it to adhere tightly to surfaces in unstable dune environments.</p>
<p>Eionitis psammophila plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting other desert flora.</p>
