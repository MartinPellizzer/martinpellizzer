                    <h1>Eriopsis schomburgkii</h1>
<p>Eriopsis schomburgkii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eriopsis schomburgkii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
