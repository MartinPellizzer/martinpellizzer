<p>Euphorbia nevadensis var. granatensis, commonly known as the granate spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
