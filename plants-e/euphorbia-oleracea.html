                    <h1>Euphorbia oleracea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia oleracea, commonly known as the edible spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in a milky, latex-like sap that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>While some parts of the plant are edible when cooked, caution is advised due to its toxic sap.</p>
