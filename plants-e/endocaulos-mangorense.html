<p>Endocaulos mangorense, commonly known as the mangrove endocaulon, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in brackish or saline environments, such as mangrove swamps, where it adapts to fluctuating water salinity. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets.</p>
<p>Endocaulos mangorense plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
