<p>Empogona talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Acacia and Eucalyptus. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or greenish-white flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
