                    <h1>Euphorbia ambroseae var. spinosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ambroseae var. spinosa, commonly known as the spinous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
