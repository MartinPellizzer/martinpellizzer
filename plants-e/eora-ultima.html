                    <h1>Eora ultima</h1>
<p>Eora ultima, commonly known as the twilight orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which bloom only at night, are pale violet with intricate patterns that resemble celestial constellations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Eora ultima is classified as an endangered species.</p>
