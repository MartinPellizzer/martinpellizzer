                    <h1>Elytrigium</h1>
<p>Elytrigium, commonly known as goat grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of about 50 species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically grow in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats or tufts. Elytrigium species are characterized by their slender, spike-like inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for insects.</p>
