                    <h1>Encelia hispida</h1>
<p>Encelia hispida, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and spherical, yellow-flowered heads that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its adaptations include a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Encelia hispida plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
