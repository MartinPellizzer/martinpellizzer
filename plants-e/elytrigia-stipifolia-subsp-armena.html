<p>Elytrigia stipifolia subsp.</p>
<p>armena, commonly known as Armenian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
