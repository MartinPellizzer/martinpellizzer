<p>Eleocharis gracilis var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
