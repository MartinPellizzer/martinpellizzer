<p>Euphorbia biconvexa, commonly known as the two-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
