                    <h1>Euphorbia portulacoides var. andensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia portulacoides var. andensis, commonly known as the Andean spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
