<p>Epilobium hirsutum var. tomentosum, commonly known as woolly willow or hairy willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and adaptability make it a common pioneer species in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
