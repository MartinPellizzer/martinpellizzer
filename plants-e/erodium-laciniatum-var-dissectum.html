                    <h1>Erodium laciniatum var. dissectum</h1>
<p>Erodium laciniatum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and modest floral display.</p>
