                    <h1>Equisetum × schaffneri</h1>
<p>Equisetum × schaffneri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are often surrounded by a modified leaf called a sporophyll. Equisetum × schaffneri is commonly found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions and is often considered an indicator of poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and lack of seeds, it plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization.</p>
