<p>Eriachaenium, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically has basal leaves that are oval-shaped with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Eriachaenium thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession due to its ability to colonize barren environments.</p>
