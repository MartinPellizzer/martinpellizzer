<p>Echinops bipinnatus, commonly known as the two-feathered thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky globe, which are produced after the plant has bloomed. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Echinops bipinnatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
