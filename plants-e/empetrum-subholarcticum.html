                    <h1>Empetrum subholarcticum</h1>
<p>Empetrum subholarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a dwarf shrub native to the subarctic and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, greenish-white blooms that are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are red and fleshy, providing a food source for birds and small mammals in its ecosystem.</p>
