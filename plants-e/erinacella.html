                    <h1>Erinacella</h1>
<p>Erinacella, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their pale, often ghostly appearance, which gives them their common name. They are typically found in decaying wood, where they play a role in the decomposition process. Erinacella species are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological role make them an intriguing subject in mycology.</p>
