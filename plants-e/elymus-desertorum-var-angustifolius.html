                    <h1>Elymus desertorum var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Elymus desertorum var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its deep root system enables it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
