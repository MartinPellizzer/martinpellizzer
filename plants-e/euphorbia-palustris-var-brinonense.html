                    <h1>Euphorbia palustris var. brinonense</h1>
<p>Euphorbia palustris var. brinonense, commonly known as the Brinon's marsh spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in damp environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in muddy or sandy soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding or high groundwater levels.</p>
