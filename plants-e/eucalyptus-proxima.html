The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, and are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited to drought and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
