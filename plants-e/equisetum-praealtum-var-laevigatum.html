                    <h1>Equisetum praealtum var. laevigatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum praealtum var. laevigatum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its lack of true leaves and its unique, primitive morphology.</p>
