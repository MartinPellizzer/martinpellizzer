<p>Euphorbia heterophylla var. linifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
