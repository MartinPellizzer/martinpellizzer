                    <h1>Eleocharis flaccida var. genuina</h1>
<p>Eleocharis flaccida var. genuina, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
