                    <h1>Eleocharis capitata var. dispar</h1>
<p>Eleocharis capitata var. dispar, commonly known as the variable spike-rush, is a sedge species native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological variation, which can lead to confusion with other species in the genus.</p>
