                    <h1>Ebnerella angelensis</h1>
<p>Ebnerella angelensis, commonly known as the Angel's Ghost Fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ebnerella angelensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
