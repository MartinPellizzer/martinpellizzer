<p>Echinocactus montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidensis cactus, is a species native to southern South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its spines are short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus montevidensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
