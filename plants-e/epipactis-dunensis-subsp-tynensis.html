<p>Epipactis dunensis subsp.</p>
<p>tynensis, commonly known as the Tynenian helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a distinctive, fragrant flower spike that bears pale green to white blossoms.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
