<p>Eriogonum flavum subsp. typicum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western united states. it belongs to the buckwheat family and is known for its vibrant yellow blooms that appear in late spring. this subspecies is often found in rocky habitats and open woodlands where it thrives in partial shade. due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
