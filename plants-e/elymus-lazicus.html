                    <h1>Elymus lazicus</h1>
<p>Elymus lazicus, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across dry, sandy soils. Elymus lazicus is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of its native habitats.</p>
