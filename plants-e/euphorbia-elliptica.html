                    <h1>Euphorbia elliptica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flowering structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
