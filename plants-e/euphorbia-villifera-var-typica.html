                    <h1>Euphorbia villifera var. typica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia villifera var. typica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and spiny appearance, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a resilient, drought-tolerant species.</p>
