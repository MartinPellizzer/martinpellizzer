                    <h1>Equisetum palustre f. nigridens</h1>
<p>Equisetum palustre f. nigridens, commonly known as the black-stemmed field horsetail, is a variant of the common field horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its slender, jointed stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Its stems are dark green to black in color, which distinguishes it from the more common green-stemmed forms.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, contributing to its role in early successional ecosystems.</p>
