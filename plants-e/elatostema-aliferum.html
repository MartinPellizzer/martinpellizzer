<p>Elatostema aliferum, commonly known as the silverleaf stinging plant, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many stinging plants, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not typically considered a weed and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>
