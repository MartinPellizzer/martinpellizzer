                    <h1>Echinocactus platyacanthus f. grandis</h1>
<p>Echinocactus platyacanthus f. grandis, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
