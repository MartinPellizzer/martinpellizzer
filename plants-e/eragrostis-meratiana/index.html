<p>Eragrostis meratiana, scientifically known as Eragrostis meratiana, is a lesser-known grass species native to parts of Africa. This plant belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes a wide variety of grasses found across the globe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and small, spike-like inflorescences. Despite its modest appearance, Eragrostis meratiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. Its study offers insights into the adaptability of grasses in diverse environmental conditions.</p>
