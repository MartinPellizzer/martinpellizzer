                            <h1>Euphorbia Humifusa F. Glabra</h1>
<p>Smoothleaf spurge, scientifically known as Euphorbia humifusa f. glabra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features fleshy, smooth-textured leaves and produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Despite its attractive appearance, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. It is commonly used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
