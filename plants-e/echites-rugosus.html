                    <h1>Echites rugosus</h1>
<p>Echites rugosus, commonly known as the rough echites, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echites rugosus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
