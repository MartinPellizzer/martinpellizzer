<p>Echinocactus hystrichocentrus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, pale spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to dry climates, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
