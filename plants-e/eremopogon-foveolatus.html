                    <h1>Eremopogon foveolatus</h1>
<p>Eremopogon foveolatus, commonly known as the funnel-shaped sac fungus, is a species of sac fungus in the family Sphaeriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped or funnel-like fruiting body that often has a central depression. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from a sac-like structure called an ascoma, which is embedded in the surface of the fruiting body.</p>
<p>Eremopogon foveolatus is often found in temperate regions and is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
