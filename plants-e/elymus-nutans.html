<p>Elymus nutans, commonly known as nodding wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Elymus nutans is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
