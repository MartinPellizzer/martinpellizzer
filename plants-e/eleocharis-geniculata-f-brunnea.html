                    <h1>Eleocharis geniculata f. brunnea</h1>
<p>Eleocharis geniculata f. brunnea, commonly known as the brown-stem sedgeland, is a variant of the spike-rush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown, often reddish stems that distinguish it from the typical green-stemmed forms of the species. The plant typically grows in shallow, muddy areas and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
