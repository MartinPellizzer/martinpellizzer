<p>Eleocharis obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its slender, grass-like stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are broad and flat, with a rough texture. Eleocharis obtusa produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
