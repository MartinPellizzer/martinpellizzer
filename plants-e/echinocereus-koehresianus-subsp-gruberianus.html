<p>Echinocereus koehresianus subsp.</p>
<p>gruberianus, commonly known as the Gruber's hedgehog cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
