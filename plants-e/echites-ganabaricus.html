                    <h1>Echites ganabaricus</h1>
<p>Echites ganabaricus, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact. It thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Echites ganabaricus plays a role in supporting pollinators and can be used in traditional medicine, though its stinging properties require caution when handling.</p>
