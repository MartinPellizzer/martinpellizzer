                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaepeplus var. sinaica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaepeplus var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
