                    <h1>Euphorbia waterbergensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia waterbergensis, commonly known as the Waterberg Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions, where it adapts to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
