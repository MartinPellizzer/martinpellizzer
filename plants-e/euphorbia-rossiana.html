<p>Euphorbia rossiana, commonly known as Ross's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
