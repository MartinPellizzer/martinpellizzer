                    <h1>Euphorbiodendron puniceum</h1>
<p>Euphorbiodendron puniceum, commonly known as the red euphorbia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbiodendron puniceum is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
