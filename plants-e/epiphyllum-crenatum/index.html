                            <h1>Epiphyllum Crenatum</h1>
<p>Epiphyllum crenatum, also known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a fascinating species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is prized for its large, showy flowers that open at night and fade by dawn. Despite its name, it is not a true cactus but a type of succulent that often grows on other plants. Its unique appearance and blooming habits make it a popular choice for both gardeners and collectors. This plant requires careful care to thrive, making it a rewarding addition to any indoor or outdoor space.</p>
