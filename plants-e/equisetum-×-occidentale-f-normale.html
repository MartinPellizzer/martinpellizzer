<p>Equisetum × occidentale f. normale, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum × occidentale and Equisetum normale.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands and along streambanks. The plant features whorled, needle-like leaves that are jointed and contain silica, giving them a rough, abrasive texture. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique, ancient-looking foliage.</p>
