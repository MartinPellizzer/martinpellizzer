                    <h1>Eriogonum microtheca var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum microtheca var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Eriogonum microtheca var. alpinum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
