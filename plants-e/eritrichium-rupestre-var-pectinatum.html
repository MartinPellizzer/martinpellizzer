                    <h1>Eritrichium rupestre var. pectinatum</h1>
<p>Eritrichium rupestre var. pectinatum, commonly known as the woolly erin, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates.</p>
