<p>Erigeron hodgsoniae, commonly known as Hodges' fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
