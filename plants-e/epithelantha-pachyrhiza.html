                    <h1>Epithelantha pachyrhiza</h1>
<p>Epithelantha pachyrhiza, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to extract moisture from deep underground.</p>
<p>Epithelantha pachyrhiza is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
