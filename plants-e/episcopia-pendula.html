<p>Episcopia pendula, commonly known as the weeping brookweed, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or other submerged surfaces. The plant has slender, hanging stems that bear small, oval-shaped leaves, which are often submerged but occasionally emerge above the water. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Episcopia pendula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
