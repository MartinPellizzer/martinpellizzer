<p>Ericameria nauseosa var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the psilocybin chamaecyparis, is a variety of the narrowleaf ericameria native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant contains psychoactive compounds, including psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands.</p>
