<p>Encephalartos marunguensis, commonly known as the Marungwenzi cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
