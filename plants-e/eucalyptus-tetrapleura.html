                    <h1>Eucalyptus tetrapleura</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus tetrapleura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a tall, hardy tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its bark is typically flaky and peels away in strips, revealing a smooth, pale underneath surface.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus tetrapleura is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment.</p>
