                    <h1>Eragrostis podotricha</h1>
<p>Eragrostis podotricha, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Silky fingergrass is often found in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
