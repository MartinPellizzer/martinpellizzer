<p>Ecbolium assamicum, commonly known as the Assam thornapple, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible berries, though they are often avoided due to their bitter taste. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species.</p>
