                    <h1>Euphorbia pubescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>
