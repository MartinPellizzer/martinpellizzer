                    <h1>Elaphoglossum vohimavense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum vohimavense, commonly known as the Vohimava holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum vohimavense is considered a conservation concern.</p>
