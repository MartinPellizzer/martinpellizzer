<p>Eccoilopus tahoensis, commonly known as the Lake Tahoe water shield, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's surface. It plays an important role in stabilizing water clarity and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
