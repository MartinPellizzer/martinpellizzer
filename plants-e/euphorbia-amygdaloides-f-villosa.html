<p>Euphorbia amygdaloides f. villosa, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States.</p>

Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its unique texture and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
