                    <h1>Euphorbia denisii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia denisii, commonly known as the Denis's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia denisii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
