<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with reddish margins, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and arranged in clusters, blooming from spring to summer.</p>
<p>Epilobium rubromarginatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
