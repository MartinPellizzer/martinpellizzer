<p>Euphorbia impressa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, ribbed, gray-green stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating.</p>
<p>Euphorbia impressa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
