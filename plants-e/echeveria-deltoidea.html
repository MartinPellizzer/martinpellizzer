                    <h1>Echeveria deltoidea</h1>
<p>Echeveria deltoidea, commonly known as the Delta Echeveria, is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Echeveria deltoidea thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
