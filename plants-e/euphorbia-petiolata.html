                    <h1>Euphorbia petiolata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia petiolata, commonly known as the paddle cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia petiolata is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
