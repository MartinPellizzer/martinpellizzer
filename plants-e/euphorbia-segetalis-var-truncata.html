                    <h1>Euphorbia segetalis var. truncata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia segetalis var. truncata, commonly known as the cutleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and often spiny leaves that are truncate or notched at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
