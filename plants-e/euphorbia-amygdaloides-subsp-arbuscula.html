<p>Euphorbia amygdaloides subsp.</p>
<p>arbuscula, commonly known as the "buttercup spurge," is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its distinctive floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
