<p>Enemion stipitatum, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a low-growing rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring. Its flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps to protect them from frost.</p>
<p>Enemion stipitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators.</p>
