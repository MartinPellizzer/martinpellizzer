<p>Eugenia capizensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and small, fleshy berries. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and it produces white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
