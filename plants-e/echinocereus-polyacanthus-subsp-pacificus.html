<p>Echinocereus polyacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Baja California. It is a low-growing, clumping cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has spiny areoles that bear both spines and flowers, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
