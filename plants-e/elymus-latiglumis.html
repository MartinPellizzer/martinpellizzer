<p>Elymus latiglumis, commonly known as the thick-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, and its leaves are typically thick and bluish-green in color. Elymus latiglumis is often found in open areas such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
