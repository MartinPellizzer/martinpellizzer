<p>Epidendrum cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces long, branching inflorescences.</p>
<p>Epidendrum cucullatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
