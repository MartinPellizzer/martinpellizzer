                    <h1>Euphorbia dobrogensis f. latibracteata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dobrogensis f. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Dobruja region of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, thick, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader bracts surrounding the cyathia, giving it its specific epithet "latibracteata.".</p>
