<p>Euphorbia portulacoides var. major, commonly known as the desert croton, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
