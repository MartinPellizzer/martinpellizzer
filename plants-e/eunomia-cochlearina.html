                    <h1>Eunomia cochlearina</h1>
<p>Eunomia cochlearina, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to its harsh, mountainous environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a touch of beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
