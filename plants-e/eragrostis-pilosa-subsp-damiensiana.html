<p>Eragrostis pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>damiensiana, commonly known as Damien's hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers.</p>
