                    <h1>Elmigera</h1>
<p>Elmigera, commonly known as the silver elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Elmigera is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
