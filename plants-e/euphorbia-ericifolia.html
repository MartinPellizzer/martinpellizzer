                    <h1>Euphorbia ericifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ericifolia, commonly known as the heather spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ericifolia is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritant to the skin.</p>
