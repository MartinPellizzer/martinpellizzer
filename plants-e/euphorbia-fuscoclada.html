                    <h1>Euphorbia fuscoclada</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fuscoclada, commonly known as the dark-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in yellowish-green cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fuscoclada is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
