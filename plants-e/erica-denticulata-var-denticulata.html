                    <h1>Erica denticulata var. denticulata</h1>
<p>Erica denticulata var. denticulata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coasts of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine teeth, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is a key component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
