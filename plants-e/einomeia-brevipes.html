<p>Einomeia brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Einomeia brevipes is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
