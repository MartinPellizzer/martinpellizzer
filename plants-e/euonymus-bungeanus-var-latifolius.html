                    <h1>Euonymus bungeanus var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Euonymus bungeanus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, including China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other euonymus species.</p>
