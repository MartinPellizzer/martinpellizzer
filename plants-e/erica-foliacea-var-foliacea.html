<p>Erica foliacea var. foliacea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
