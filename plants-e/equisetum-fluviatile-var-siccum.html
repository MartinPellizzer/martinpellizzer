                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile var. siccum</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile var. siccum, commonly known as the dry river hawthorn, is a variant of the common field horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in moist or wet habitats, such as riverbanks and marshy areas. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are important for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments.</p>
