                    <h1>Eichhornia natans</h1>
<p>Eichhornia natans, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge, and it produces striking purple flowers with a distinctive central spadix. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. Its roots are submerged and absorb nutrients from the water, which can affect water quality.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to outcompete native plants and disrupt ecosystems.</p>
