<p>Echinocereus occidentalis subsp.</p>
<p>breckwoldtiorum, commonly known as the Breckwoldt's prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant features dense spines that protect it from herbivores and provide shade to the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
