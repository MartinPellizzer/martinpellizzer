                    <h1>Escobedia silvia</h1>
<p>Escobedia silvia, commonly known as Silvia's escoboid, is a rare and delicate lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-green thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen lacks distinct medulla and has a thin, uniform cortex, which is a common feature in many foliose and crustose lichens. Escobedia silvia is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forests or on the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
