                    <h1>Erysimum altaicum var. humillimum</h1>
<p>Erysimum altaicum var. humillimum, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and on slopes, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
