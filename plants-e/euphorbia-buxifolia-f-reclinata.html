                    <h1>Euphorbia buxifolia f. reclinata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia buxifolia f. reclinata, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a compact, low-growing succulent with a unique, cushion-like appearance.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is native to South Africa and thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
