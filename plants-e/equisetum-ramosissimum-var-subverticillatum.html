                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. subverticillatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. subverticillatum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches.</p>
<p>It possesses a slender, jointed stem that is covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its unique morphology.</p>
