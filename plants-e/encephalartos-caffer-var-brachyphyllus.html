                    <h1>Encephalartos caffer var. brachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos caffer var. brachyphyllus, commonly known as the Natal knobbed cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and broad, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, blue-green coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically important to conserve this unique botanical species.</p>
