                    <h1>Euphorbia nana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nana, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often mistaken for flowers due to their appearance. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nana is typically hardy in USDA zones 3 to 7 and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
