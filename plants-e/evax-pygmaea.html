                    <h1>Evax pygmaea</h1>
<p>Evax pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
