                    <h1>Euphorbia baillonii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia baillonii, commonly known as the Bailloni's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia baillonii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
