                    <h1>Equisetum heleocharis var. vulgare</h1>
<p>Equisetum heleocharis var. vulgare, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a species of horsetail that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the water's edge. Its stems are hollow and contain a silica-rich tissue called xylem, which contributes to its rigid structure.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies.</p>
