                    <h1>Eleocharis sanguinolenta</h1>
<p>Eleocharis sanguinolenta, commonly known as the red spike rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of reddish-brown flowers that stand upright above grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis sanguinolenta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
