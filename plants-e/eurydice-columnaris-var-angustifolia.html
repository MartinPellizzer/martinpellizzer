                    <h1>Eurydice columnaris var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Eurydice columnaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking blue or violet flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, often found along rocky shores and dunes where it tolerates high salt exposure and strong wave action. The plant has a compact growth habit with upright stems that bear clusters of showy bracts. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
