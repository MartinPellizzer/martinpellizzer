<p>Eriospermum glaciale, commonly known as the glacier eriosperm, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky soils and withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Eriospermum glaciale is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in high-altitude gardens.</p>
