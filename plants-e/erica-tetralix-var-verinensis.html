                    <h1>Erica tetralix var. verinensis</h1>
<p>Erica tetralix var. verinensis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of France and the British Isles.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and cliff habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
