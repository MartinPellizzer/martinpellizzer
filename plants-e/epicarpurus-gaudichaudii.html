                    <h1>Epicarpurus gaudichaudii</h1>
<p>Epicarpurus gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a woody stem and thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it well-adapted to coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in maritime habitats.</p>
