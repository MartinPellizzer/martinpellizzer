<p>Erodium cicutarium var. filicinum, commonly known as the fern-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pinnate, bract-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
