                    <h1>Elytropus</h1>
<p>Elytropus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Elytropus species are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their resilience, some species of Elytropus are also cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
