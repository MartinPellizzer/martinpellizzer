                    <h1>Euphorbia articulata var. lordatii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia articulata var. lordatii, commonly known as the Lord's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped and arranged oppositely along the stems.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats.</p>
