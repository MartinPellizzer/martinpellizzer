<p>Elymus lanatus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are clustered in dense, bristly arrangements.</p>
<p>Elymus lanatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
