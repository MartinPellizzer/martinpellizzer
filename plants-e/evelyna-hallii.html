The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and requires cool, moist conditions to thrive. Its unique pollination strategy involves specific nocturnal pollinators, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Evelyna hallii is considered endangered and is the focus of conservation efforts.</p>
