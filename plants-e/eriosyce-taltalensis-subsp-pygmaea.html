<p>Eriosyce taltalensis subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea, commonly known as the Taltal pygmy cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its dense, globular shape and pale green to bluish-gray stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as moths and beetles. It thrives in arid, coastal environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
