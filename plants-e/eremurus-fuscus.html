<p>Eremurus fuscus, commonly known as the black eremurus, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence composed of numerous yellow to orange flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eremurus fuscus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
