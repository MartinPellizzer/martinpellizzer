                    <h1>Edritria paludosa</h1>
<p>Edritria paludosa, commonly known as the marsh thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Edritria paludosa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting pollinators.</p>
