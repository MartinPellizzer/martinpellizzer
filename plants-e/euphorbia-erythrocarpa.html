<p>Euphorbia erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its most distinctive characteristic is the bright red, fleshy fruits that develop after flowering.</p>
<p>Euphorbia erythrocarpa is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
