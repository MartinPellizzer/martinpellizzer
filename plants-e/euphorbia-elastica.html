<p>Euphorbia elastica, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of a yellowish cyathium surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbia elastica is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to tolerate low light and minimal watering.</p>
