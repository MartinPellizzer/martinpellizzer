<p>Euphorbia wahlbergii, commonly known as the "Mouse-eared cactus," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and grayish-green, with a distinctive waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia wahlbergii is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
