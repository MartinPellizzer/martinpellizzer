<p>Euphorbia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in soft, fimbriated (fringed) leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fimbriata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
