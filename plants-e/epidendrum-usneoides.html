                    <h1>Epidendrum usneoides</h1>
<p>Epidendrum usneoides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It does not derive nutrients from its host but instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has long, hanging filaments that form dense, moss-like clusters on trees. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
