<p>Elatostema yenii, commonly known as the Yen's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can absorb nutrients from both water and the surrounding soil. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may extend slightly above the water surface.</p>
<p>Elatostema yenii is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in supporting microfauna in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
