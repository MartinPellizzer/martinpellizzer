                    <h1>Euphorbia campestris var. seemannii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia campestris var. seemannii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
