<p>Euphorbia monteiroi subsp.</p>
<p>ramosa, commonly known as the Monteiro's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, alternate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
