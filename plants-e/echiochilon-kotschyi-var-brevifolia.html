                    <h1>Echiochilon kotschyi var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Echiochilon kotschyi var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved echiochilon, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration in semi-arid environments.</p>
