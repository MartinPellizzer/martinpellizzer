                    <h1>Echinochloa echinata var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Echinochloa echinata var. decipiens, commonly known as the false brome, is a grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
