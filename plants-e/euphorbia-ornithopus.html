<p>Euphorbia ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's beak euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny stem with a narrow, bird-like beak-shaped tip, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
