<p>Epipactis grandis, commonly known as the large helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant has a complex life cycle, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during its early growth stages. Its leaves are broad and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epipactis grandis thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found growing in association with other orchid species.</p>
