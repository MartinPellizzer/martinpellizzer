                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale f. major</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale f. major, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is common in wetlands and along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record indicates a long evolutionary history.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its primitive morphology and its role in paleobotanical studies.</p>
