                    <h1>Eriophorum hudsonianum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum hudsonianum, commonly known as Hudson's cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. Its growth is closely tied to the short growing season of polar climates, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
