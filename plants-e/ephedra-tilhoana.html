<p>Ephedra tilhoana, commonly known as the desert ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its green, branched stems that resemble branches rather than true leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ephedra tilhoana is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability, showcasing features such as reduced foliage and deep root systems.</p>
<p>It is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxic alkaloid content.</p>
