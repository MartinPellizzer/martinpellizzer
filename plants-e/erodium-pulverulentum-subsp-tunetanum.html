<p>Erodium pulverulentum subsp.</p>
<p>tunetanum, commonly known as the Tunisian erodium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a low-growing annual herb with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, pink or violet flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to disperse the seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
