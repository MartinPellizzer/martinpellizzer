<p>Elytrigia trichophora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of hairy structures on the leaves, giving it a sleek appearance compared to other varieties of Elytrigia trichophora.</p>
