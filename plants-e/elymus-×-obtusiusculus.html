                    <h1>Elymus × obtusiusculus</h1>
<p>Elymus × obtusiusculus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
