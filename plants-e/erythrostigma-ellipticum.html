                    <h1>Erythrostigma ellipticum</h1>
<p>Erythrostigma ellipticum, commonly known as the red-stained elliptic orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and strikingly colored floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, are notable for their intricate patterns and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Erythrostigma ellipticum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
