                    <h1>Exochaenium</h1>
<p>Exochaenium, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Exochaenium species are typically perennial and play a role in stabilizing soils in their native habitats.</p>
