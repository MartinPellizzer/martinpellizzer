<p>Englerophoenix tetrasticha, commonly known as the four-needle date palm, is a flowering plant species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, clustered stems and small, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is less commonly cultivated for this purpose compared to other date palms. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential for adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
