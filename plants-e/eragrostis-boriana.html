<p>Eragrostis boriana, commonly known as the mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and female flowers, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
