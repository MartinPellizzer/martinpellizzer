                    <h1>Elatostema subcoriaceum</h1>
<p>Elatostema subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
