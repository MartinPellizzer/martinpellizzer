                    <h1>Euphorbia eduardoi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eduardoi, commonly known as the Edward's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are often thick and fleshy, adapted for reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia eduardoi is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
