                    <h1>Euphorbia gaillardotii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gaillardotii, commonly known as the Gaillardot's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with prominent, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
