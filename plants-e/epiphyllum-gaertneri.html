                <h1>Epiphyllum gaertneri</h1>
<p>Epiphyllum gaertneri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting.</p>
<p>Epiphyllum gaertneri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
