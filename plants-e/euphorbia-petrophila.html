                    <h1>Euphorbia petrophila</h1>
<p>Euphorbia petrophila, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces unique, spiny inflorescences that contain yellowish-green flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia petrophila is well-suited to rocky soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient example of desert flora.</p>
