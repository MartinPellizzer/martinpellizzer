                    <h1>Euphorbia vaccaria</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vaccaria, commonly known as the petty spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a succulent, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vaccaria is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to skin and is used in traditional medicine.</p>
