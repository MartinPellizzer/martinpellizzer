<p>Endopappus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spherical, woody fruits. Its fruiting bodies are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of bristles, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Endopappus macrocarpus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
