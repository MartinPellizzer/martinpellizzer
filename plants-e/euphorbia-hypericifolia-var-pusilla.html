                    <h1>Euphorbia hypericifolia var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hypericifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia or small-leaved spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for container gardening and coastal areas.</p>
