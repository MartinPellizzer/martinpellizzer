                    <h1>Elymus barbicallus var. pubinodis</h1>
<p>Elymus barbicallus var. pubinodis, commonly known as the hairy bearded wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically hairy, giving it its varietal name "pubinodis," which refers to the pubescent (hairy) structure. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
