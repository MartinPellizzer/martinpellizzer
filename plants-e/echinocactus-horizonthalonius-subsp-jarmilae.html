<p>Echinocactus horizonthalonius subsp.</p>
<p>jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilová's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of about 20 to 40 centimeters and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is named in honor of the Czech botanist Jarmila Šimáčková, who contributed significantly to the study of cacti.</p>
