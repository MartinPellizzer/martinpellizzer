                    <h1>Epidendrum lucidum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum lucidum, commonly known as the shining epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitats. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a key feature in orchid pollination. Epidendrum lucidum thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
