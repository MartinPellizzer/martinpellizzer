                    <h1>Elaphoglossum pangteyi</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum pangteyi, commonly known as the Pacific Northwest holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist, shaded forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, holly-like fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments, often forming dense, low-growing mats on forest floors. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in shaded, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
