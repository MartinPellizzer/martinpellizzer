                    <h1>Euphorbia hajhirensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hajhirensis, commonly known as the Hajir Euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hajhirensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
