                    <h1>Erythraea littoralis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Erythraea littoralis var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal erythraea, is a variant of the erythraea plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid and saline conditions. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in regions with high salt exposure and fluctuating moisture levels.</p>
