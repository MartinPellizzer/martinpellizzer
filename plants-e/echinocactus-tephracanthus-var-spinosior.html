                    <h1>Echinocactus tephracanthus var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Echinocactus tephracanthus var. spinosior, commonly known as the Mexican giant hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its increased spination compared to the typical form, making it a striking and resilient plant.</p>
