                    <h1>Euphorbia oxyodonta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia oxyodonta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody stem with smooth, greenish-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia oxyodonta is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
