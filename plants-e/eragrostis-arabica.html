                    <h1>Eragrostis arabica</h1>
<p>Eragrostis arabica, commonly known as Arabian lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for restoration projects in degraded landscapes. It plays a role in preventing soil erosion and provides forage for livestock in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its low nutritional value for grazing animals.</p>
