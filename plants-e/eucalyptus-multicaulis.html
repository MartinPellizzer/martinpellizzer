                    <h1>Eucalyptus multicaulis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus multicaulis, commonly known as the sturt's eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range from white to pale blue, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus multicaulis is adapted to dry, inland environments and is often found in woodlands and on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>
