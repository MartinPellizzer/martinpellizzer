<p>Eichhornia caracasana, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface. The plant produces dense clusters of showy purple-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. Water hyacinth grows rapidly, often forming dense mats on the water surface, which can impact water flow and quality.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
