                    <h1>Enchysia repens var. reflexa</h1>
<p>Enchysia repens var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its adaptability to saline and sandy soils makes it a hardy species often found in coastal dunes and wetlands.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'reflexa' refers to the downward-curving nature of its leaf margins, a distinctive morphological feature.</p>
