<p>Eragrostis tenellula, commonly known as slender weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny grains, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
