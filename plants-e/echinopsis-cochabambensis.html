                    <h1>Echinopsis cochabambensis</h1>
<p>Echinopsis cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, globular shape, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinopsis cochabambensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
