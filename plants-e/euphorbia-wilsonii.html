                    <h1>Euphorbia wilsonii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's spurge, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
