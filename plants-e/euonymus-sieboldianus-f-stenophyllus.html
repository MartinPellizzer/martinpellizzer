                    <h1>Euonymus sieboldianus f. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Euonymus sieboldianus f. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>This form is prized in horticulture for its dense foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
