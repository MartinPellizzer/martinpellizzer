                    <h1>Euphorbia sulcata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sulcata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sulcata is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
