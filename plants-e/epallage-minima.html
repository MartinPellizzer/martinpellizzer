                    <h1>Epallage minima</h1>
<p>Epallage minima, commonly known as the dwarf epallage, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often resembling miniature versions of its larger relatives. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a velvety texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epallage minima is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
