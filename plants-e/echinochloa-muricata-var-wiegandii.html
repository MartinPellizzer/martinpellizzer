<p>Echinochloa muricata var. wiegandii, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively in wetland and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
