<p>Elaeochytris meifolia, commonly known as the golden alga, is a unicellular marine alga belonging to the class Xanthophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish-brown color due to the presence of carotenoids, which help in light absorption. This organism is typically found in coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays a role in the marine food web. Elaeochytris meifolia is also noted for its ability to form blooms under nutrient-rich conditions.</p>
<p>Its cellular structure includes a cell wall composed of cellulose and a nucleus, typical of eukaryotic algae.</p>
