                    <h1>Epiphyllum phyllanthus</h1>
<p>Epiphyllum phyllanthus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a climbing or trailing cactus that produces large, showy flowers, typically in shades of pink, white, or yellow. The plant has flat, fleshy stems that store water, and its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true cactus but is often mistaken for one due to its similar appearance.</p>
