                    <h1>Euphorbia denudata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia denudata, commonly known as the naked stem spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, green stems that are often mistaken for leaves, as it lacks true leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
