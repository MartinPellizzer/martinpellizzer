<p>Erucaria uncata subsp.</p>
<p>aegiceras, commonly known as the mangrove sedges, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and brackish environments. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, including estuaries and tidal mudflats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
