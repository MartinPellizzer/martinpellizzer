<p>Erica sparsa var. sparsa, commonly known as the sparse heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Erica sparsa var. sparsa is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
