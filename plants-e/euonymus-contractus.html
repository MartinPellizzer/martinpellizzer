                    <h1>Euonymus contractus</h1>
<p>Euonymus contractus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries that persist into the winter. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
