                    <h1>Epistephium portellianum</h1>
<p>Epistephium portellianum, commonly known as the Portellian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
