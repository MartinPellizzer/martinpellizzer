<p>Exostema curbeloi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
