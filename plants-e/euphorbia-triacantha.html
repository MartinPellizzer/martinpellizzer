<p>Euphorbia triacantha, commonly known as the spiny cactus or goat's horn cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by unique, gelatinous fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
