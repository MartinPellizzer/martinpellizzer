                    <h1>Euphorbia pilosissima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilosissima, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
