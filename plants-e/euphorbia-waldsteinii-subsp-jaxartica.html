<p>Euphorbia waldsteinii subsp.</p>
<p>jaxartica, commonly known as the Jaxartian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features a short, thick stem covered in a layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens.</p>
