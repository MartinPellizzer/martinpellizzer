<p>Eriocaulon kwangtungense, commonly known as the Guangdong hairgrass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with slender, wiry stems and tiny, clustered leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eriocaulon kwangtungense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
