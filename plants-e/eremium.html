                    <h1>Eremium</h1>
<p>Eremium, commonly known as the "desert bell," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Eremium species are characterized by their succulent, cylindrical stems and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through thick cuticles and reduced leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Eremium capense and Eremium strictum, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
