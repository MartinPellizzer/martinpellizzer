                    <h1>Epithema brunonis var. fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Epithema brunonis var. fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered epithema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and foliage texture.</p>
