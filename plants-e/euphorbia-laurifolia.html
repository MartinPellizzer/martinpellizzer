                    <h1>Euphorbia laurifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia laurifolia, commonly known as the coastal firetree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent stems are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia laurifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions.</p>
