                    <h1>Espeletia bracteosa</h1>
<p>Espeletia bracteosa, commonly known as the "Puya raimondii" or the "Queen of the Andes," is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky rosette of leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach up to 10 meters in height, bearing numerous small, bell-shaped flowers. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in the harsh, cold, and dry conditions of the Andean highlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for both scientific study and conservation efforts.</p>
