<p>Echium plantagineum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed sites, thriving in saline environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its capsule fruits contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Sea spurge is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
