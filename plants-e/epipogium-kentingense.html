<p>Epipogium kentingense, commonly known as the Kenting ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
