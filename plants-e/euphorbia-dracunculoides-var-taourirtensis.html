                    <h1>Euphorbia dracunculoides var. taourirtensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dracunculoides var. taourirtensis, commonly known as the Taourirt Desert Spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
