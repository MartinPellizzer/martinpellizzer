                    <h1>Echinocactus senilis</h1>
<p>Echinocactus senilis, commonly known as the old man of the south, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive, almost prehistoric appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
