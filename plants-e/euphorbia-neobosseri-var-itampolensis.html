<p>Euphorbia neobosseri var. itampolensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
