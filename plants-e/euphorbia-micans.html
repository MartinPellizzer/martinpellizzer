                    <h1>Euphorbia micans</h1>
<p>Euphorbia micans, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax that gives it its characteristic silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia micans is well adapted to dry conditions and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique aesthetic.</p>
