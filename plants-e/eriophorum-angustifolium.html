<p>Eriophorum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those found in bogs and tundra environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Eriophorum angustifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
