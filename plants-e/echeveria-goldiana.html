                    <h1>Echeveria goldiana</h1>
<p>Echeveria goldiana, commonly known as the "Gold Dust" or "Lace Leaf" plant, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves with a powdery coating that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
