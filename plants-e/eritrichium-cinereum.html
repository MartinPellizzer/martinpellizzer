                    <h1>Eritrichium cinereum</h1>
<p>Eritrichium cinereum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Eritrichium cinereum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
