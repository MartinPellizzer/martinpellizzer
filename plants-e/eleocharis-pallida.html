                    <h1>Eleocharis pallida</h1>
<p>Eleocharis pallida, commonly known as the pink spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that typically displays a pink or reddish coloration. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, spike-like clusters of flowers are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis pallida is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
