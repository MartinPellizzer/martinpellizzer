<p>Elymus violaceus subsp.</p>
<p>andinus, commonly known as the Andean wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often turn reddish in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets that are typically pale green to purplish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a forage crop in high-altitude regions.</p>
