                    <h1>Euphorbia vachellii var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vachellii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
