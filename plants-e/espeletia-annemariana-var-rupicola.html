<p>Espeletia annemariana var. rupicola, commonly known as the Andean rock heather, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold, and windy environments. The plant typically has narrow, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it a hardy plant found in mountainous areas of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
