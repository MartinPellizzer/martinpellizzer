                <h1>Ephemerantha forcipata</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha forcipata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and bright, indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
