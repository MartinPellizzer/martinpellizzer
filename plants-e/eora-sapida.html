                    <h1>Eora sapida</h1>
<p>Eora sapida, commonly known as the golden dewberry, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eora sapida is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
