<p>Elymus glaucus var. maximus, commonly known as the silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
