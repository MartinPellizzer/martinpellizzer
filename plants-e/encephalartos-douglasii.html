                    <h1>Encephalartos douglasii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos douglasii, commonly known as the Douglasâ€™s cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that are typically borne on the trunk, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky, coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
