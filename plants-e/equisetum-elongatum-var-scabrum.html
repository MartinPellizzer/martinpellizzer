                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. scabrum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. scabrum, commonly known as the scabrous horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in rough, scabrous nodes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of its primitive vascular structure. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest surviving plant groups.</p>
