<p>Erodium rodiei, commonly known as the sticky weed or narrowleaf bedstraw, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its small, sticky leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be invasive in some areas, though it also serves as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>
