<p>Espeletia schultzii var. mucurubana, commonly known as the Mucuruban heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is part of the Asteraceae family and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment.</p>
