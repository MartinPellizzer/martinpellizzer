<p>Euphorbia clementei f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
