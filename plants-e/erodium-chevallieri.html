                    <h1>Erodium chevallieri</h1>
<p>Erodium chevallieri, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Erodium chevallieri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in dry landscapes.</p>
