<p>Eupatorium saltuense, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its saline habitat.</p>
<p>Eupatorium saltuense plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
