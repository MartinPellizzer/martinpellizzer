                    <h1>Equisetum polystachium</h1>
<p>Equisetum polystachium, commonly known as the horse tail or scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and the presence of jointed stems, which are covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record dates back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
