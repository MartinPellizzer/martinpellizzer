                    <h1>Eriophoropsis</h1>
<p>Eriophoropsis, commonly known as the eriophoropsis gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Eriophoridae.</p>
<p>It is primarily known for inducing galls on the leaves of various woody plants, particularly species within the genus *Prunus*. The larvae of these insects feed on plant tissues, causing abnormal growth that forms distinctive galls. These galls provide protection and nourishment for the developing larvae.</p>
<p>The plant's response to the insect's feeding results in unique morphological changes, making Eriophoropsis an important subject in the study of plant-insect interactions.</p>
