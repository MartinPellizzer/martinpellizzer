<p>Euphorbia austriaca subsp.</p>
<p>tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent nature, it is somewhat drought-tolerant but requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
