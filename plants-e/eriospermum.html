                    <h1>Eriospermum</h1>
<p>Eriospermum, commonly known as the woolly burr or desert cress, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their hairy, often glandular surfaces, which give them a distinctive appearance. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Eriospermum species produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>The plants are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to thrive in disturbed soils and their role in stabilizing sandy environments.</p>
