                    <h1>Elaphoglossum repens</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum repens, commonly known as the running holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the moist forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often form a dense carpet on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas, which is why it is sometimes referred to as a "running" fern.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems.</p>
