<p>Eucryphia pinnatifolia, commonly known as the coastal pohutukawa, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside.

These flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Eucryphia pinnatifolia thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds.</p>
