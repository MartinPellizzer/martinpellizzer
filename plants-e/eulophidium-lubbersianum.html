                    <h1>Eulophidium lubbersianum</h1>
<p>Eulophidium lubbersianum, commonly known as the lubbersianum gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>This plant-associated insect is known for inducing galls on the leaves of certain plants, primarily in the genus Eupatorium. The galls formed by Eulophidium lubbersianum are typically spherical or elongated and are composed of modified plant tissues. These galls serve as both a shelter and a food source for the developing larvae.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of this species lies in its role as a primary herbivore and its impact on plant morphology and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
