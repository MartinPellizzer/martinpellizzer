<p>Echites megagros, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually broad and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, Echites megagros plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds.</p>
