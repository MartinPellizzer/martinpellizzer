<p>Escallonia revoluta var. laxa, commonly known as the looseleaf escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt and wind.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'laxa' is distinguished by its looser foliage compared to the typical variety.</p>
