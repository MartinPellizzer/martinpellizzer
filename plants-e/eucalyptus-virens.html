                    <h1>Eucalyptus virens</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus virens, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greyish-brown bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, typically in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
