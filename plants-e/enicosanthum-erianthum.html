<p>Enicosanthum erianthum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh conditions, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
