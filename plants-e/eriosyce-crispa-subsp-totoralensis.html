<p>Eriosyce crispa subsp.</p>
<p>totoralensis, commonly known as the Totoralensis Pincushion Cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly spines and compact, globular stem structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its flowering occurs in late spring, producing yellowish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
