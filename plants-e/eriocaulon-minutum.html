                    <h1>Eriocaulon minutum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon minutum, commonly known as the minute bulbous sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
