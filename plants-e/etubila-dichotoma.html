                    <h1>Etubila dichotoma</h1>
<p>Etubila dichotoma, commonly known as the forked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Etubila dichotoma plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and birds, while also drawing nutrients from its host.</p>
