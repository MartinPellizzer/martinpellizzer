                    <h1>Eberlanzia horrescens</h1>
<p>Eberlanzia horrescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, strikingly white flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, making it highly dependent on ecological balance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Eberlanzia horrescens is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
