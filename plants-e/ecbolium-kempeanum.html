                    <h1>Ecbolium kempeanum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium kempeanum, commonly known as the Kempean ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is primarily found in specific tropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium kempeanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
