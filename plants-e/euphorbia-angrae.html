                    <h1>Euphorbia angrae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia angrae, commonly known as the Angrae spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Euphorbia angrae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
