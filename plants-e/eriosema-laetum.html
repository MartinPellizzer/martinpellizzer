<p>Eriosema laetum, commonly known as the golden eriosema, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native flora.</p>
