                    <h1>Euphorbia seguieriana var. firma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia seguieriana var. firma, commonly known as the firm euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
