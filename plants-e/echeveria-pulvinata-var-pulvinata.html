                    <h1>Echeveria pulvinata var. pulvinata</h1>
<p>Echeveria pulvinata var. pulvinata, commonly known as the Silver Dust Echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in arid environments. It produces clusters of pale purple or pink flowers on tall stems during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
