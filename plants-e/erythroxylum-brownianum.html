<p>Erythroxylum brownianum, commonly known as the brownianum erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color, followed by berries that contain the seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or undergrowth.</p>
<p>While not as well-known as other members of the Erythroxylum genus, it holds ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
