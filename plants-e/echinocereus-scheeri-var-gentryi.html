                    <h1>Echinocereus scheeri var. gentryi</h1>
<p>Echinocereus scheeri var. gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a smooth, greenish-gray surface that develops a bluish tint as it matures. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
