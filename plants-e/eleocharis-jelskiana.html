<p>Eleocharis jelskiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis jelskiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
