<p>Exochaenium hockii, commonly known as the Hock's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and has a low water requirement, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
