                    <h1>Epipactis sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Epipactis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a key feature in orchid morphology. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Epipactis sessilifolia is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in temperate regions.</p>
