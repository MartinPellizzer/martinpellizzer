                    <h1>Equisetum palustre var. tenuissimum</h1>
<p>Equisetum palustre var. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky appearance.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet, marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun. The plant features whorled leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive central stem that is segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures. It produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from cone-like structures called strobili at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging wetland conditions.</p>
