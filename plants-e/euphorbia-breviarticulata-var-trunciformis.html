                    <h1>Euphorbia breviarticulata var. trunciformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia breviarticulata var. trunciformis, commonly known as the truncated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a unique, modified leaf-like structure called a cyathium. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and distinctive appearance.</p>
