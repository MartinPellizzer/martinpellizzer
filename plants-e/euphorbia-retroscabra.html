<p>Euphorbia retroscabra, commonly known as the backward-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Euphorbia retroscabra is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
