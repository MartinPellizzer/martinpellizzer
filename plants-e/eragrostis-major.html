<p>Eragrostis major, commonly known as giant lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Eragrostis major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
