<p>Euphorbia eanophylla, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Euphorbia eanophylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
