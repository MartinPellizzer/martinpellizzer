                    <h1>Euphorbia misella</h1>
<p>Euphorbia misella, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and branching stems that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia misella is adapted to survive in dry environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
