<p>Elymus kaschgaricus, commonly known as the Karakorum wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Elymus kaschgaricus is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
