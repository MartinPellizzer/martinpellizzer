<p>Eleusine ciliata, commonly known as lovegrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Eleusine ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed.</p>
