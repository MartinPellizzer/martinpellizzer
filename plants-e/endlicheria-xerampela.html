<p>Endlicheria xerampela, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
