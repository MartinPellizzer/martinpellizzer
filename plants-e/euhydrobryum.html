                    <h1>Euhydrobryum</h1>
<p>Euhydrobryum, commonly known as the water moss, is a genus of small, aquatic or semi-aquatic liverworts.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and shaded forest floors. They have a thalloid structure, which is a flat, ribbon-like body that lacks true stems and leaves. Euhydrobryum species are characterized by their ability to absorb water through their entire surface, aiding in their survival in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Their simple morphology and reliance on moisture make them important indicators of environmental health in wetland ecosystems.</p>
