<p>Eberlanzia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny balsa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Eberlanzia spinosa is often found in dry forests and savannas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
