                    <h1>Eurya japonica var. montana</h1>
<p>Eurya japonica var. montana, commonly known as the mountain eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
