                    <h1>Erythroxylum microphyllum f. serpyllifolium</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum microphyllum f. serpyllifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved copal tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by red or orange berries containing seeds. It is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>However, it is not related to the coca plant and does not contain the alkaloids associated with Erythroxylum species like E. coca.</p>
