                    <h1>Eucalyptus selachiana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus selachiana, commonly known as the coastal eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment. It produces small, globular flowers that are usually pale green or yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
