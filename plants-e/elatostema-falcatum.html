<p>Elatostema falcatum, commonly known as the creeping arrowleaf, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Elatostema falcatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common ground cover in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
