                    <h1>Eriocaulon cauliferum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon cauliferum, commonly known as the mountain marsh grass, is a small perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its tiny, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spike-like clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon cauliferum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments and for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
