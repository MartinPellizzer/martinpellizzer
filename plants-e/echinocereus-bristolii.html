                    <h1>Echinocereus bristolii</h1>
<p>Echinocereus bristolii, commonly known as the Bristol prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocereus bristolii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes.</p>
