                    <h1>Eriocaulon sikokianum var. mikawanum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon sikokianum var. mikawanum, commonly known as the Mikawanum spike-rush, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that emerge from the water's surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates, often in marshy or swampy environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
