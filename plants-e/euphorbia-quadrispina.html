<p>Euphorbia quadrispina, commonly known as the four-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia quadrispina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
