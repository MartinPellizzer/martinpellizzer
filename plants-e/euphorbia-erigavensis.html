                    <h1>Euphorbia erigavensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia erigavensis, commonly known as the upright spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
