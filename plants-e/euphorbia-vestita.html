<p>Euphorbia vestita, commonly known as the naked spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem covered in a white, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vestita is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
