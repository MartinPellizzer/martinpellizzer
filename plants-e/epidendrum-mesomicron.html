<p>Epidendrum mesomicron, commonly known as the miniature epidendrum, is a compact orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and manageable size, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
