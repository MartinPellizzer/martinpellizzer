                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. aristata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. aristata, commonly known as cockspur grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and distinctive, bristled inflorescence that resembles a cock's spur. The plant typically thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature.</p>
