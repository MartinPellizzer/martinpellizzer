                    <h1>Euphrasia paludosa</h1>
<p>Euphrasia paludosa, commonly known as bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshy or swampy environments. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its showy blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Euphrasia paludosa is often found in association with other wetland flora and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
