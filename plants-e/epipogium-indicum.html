                    <h1>Epipogium indicum</h1>
<p>Epipogium indicum, commonly known as the Indian ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often mistaken for mushrooms due to their shape and color. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
