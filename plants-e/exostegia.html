                    <h1>Exostegia</h1>
<p>Exostegia, commonly known as the "silverleaf plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Exostegia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>They produce small, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
