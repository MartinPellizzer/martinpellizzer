                    <h1>Euphorbia cespitosa var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cespitosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has slender, angular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
