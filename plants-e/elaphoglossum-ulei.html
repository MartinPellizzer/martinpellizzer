                    <h1>Elaphoglossum ulei</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum ulei, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
