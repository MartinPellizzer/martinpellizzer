                    <h1>Eucalyptus fruticetorum</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus fruticetorum, commonly known as the snow gum, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and firewood.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus fruticetorum thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment.</p>
