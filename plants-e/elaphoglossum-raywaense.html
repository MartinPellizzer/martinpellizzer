<p>Elaphoglossum raywaense, commonly known as the Raywa holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum raywaense is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
