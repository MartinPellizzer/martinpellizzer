The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with spore-producing clusters arranged in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
