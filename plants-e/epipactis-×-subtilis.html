                    <h1>Epipactis × subtilis</h1>
<p>Epipactis × subtilis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis purpurea, exhibiting a combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it produces small, dark brown capsules as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions.</p>
