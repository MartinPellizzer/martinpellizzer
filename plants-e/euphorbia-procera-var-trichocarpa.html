                    <h1>Euphorbia procera var. trichocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia procera var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>This species is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
