                    <h1>Eriospermum bracteatum</h1>
<p>Eriospermum bracteatum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, bracteate seed heads. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Eriospermum bracteatum is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
