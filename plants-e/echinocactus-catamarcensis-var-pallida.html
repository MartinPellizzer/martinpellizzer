                    <h1>Echinocactus catamarcensis var. pallida</h1>
<p>Echinocactus catamarcensis var. pallida, commonly known as the pale catamarca cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and distinctive, pale green to bluish-gray spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are often concealed within the spines. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
