                    <h1>Eidothea</h1>
<p>Eidothea, commonly known as the "southern magnolia," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Magnoliaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of a single species, Eidothea crassifolia, which is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are large,革质 (leathery), and evergreen, providing a striking visual contrast to the flowers.</p>
<p>Eidothea is notable for its primitive floral structure and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage.</p>
