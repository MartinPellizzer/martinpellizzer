<p>Elaphoglossum araneosum, commonly known as the spider net fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble a spider's web. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum araneosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
