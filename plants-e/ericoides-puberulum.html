<p>Ericoides puberulum, commonly known as the hairy eric, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its roots are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in heathland and fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Ericoides puberulum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
