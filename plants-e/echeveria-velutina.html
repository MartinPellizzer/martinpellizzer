                    <h1>Echeveria velutina</h1>
<p>Echeveria velutina, commonly known as the velvet echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-gray or silver in color, covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
