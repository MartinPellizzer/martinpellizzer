<p>Eleocharis tenerrima, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond margins and wetlands, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis tenerrima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water environments.</p>
