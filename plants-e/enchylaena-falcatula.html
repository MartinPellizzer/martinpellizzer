<p>Enchylaena falcatula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mulga, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. Its fibrous bark and tough leaves make it resilient to fire and grazing.</p>
<p>Enchylaena falcatula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
