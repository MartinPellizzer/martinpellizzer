                    <h1>Euphorbia verrucosa var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia verrucosa var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and the stems are often branched and upright.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
