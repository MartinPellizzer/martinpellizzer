<p>Epiphyllanthus microsphaericus, commonly known as the dwarf mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on the surfaces of other plants, such as tree trunks or branches, as an epiphyte. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
