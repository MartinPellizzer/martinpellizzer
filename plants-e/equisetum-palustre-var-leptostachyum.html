<p>Equisetum palustre var. leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often clustered in a distinctive, spike-like arrangement. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its primitive appearance and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
