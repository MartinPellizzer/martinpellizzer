<p>Epidendrum cauliflorum, commonly known as the Christmas Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a unique cauliflorous manner, meaning they develop on the stems rather than the tops of the leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive red or orange lip.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms.</p>
