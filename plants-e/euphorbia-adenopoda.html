<p>Euphorbia adenopoda, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Euphorbia adenopoda is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
