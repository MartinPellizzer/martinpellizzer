                    <h1>Ebnerella capensis</h1>
<p>Ebnerella capensis, commonly known as the Cape candelabra, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, a feature common in many succulents adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Ebnerella capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
