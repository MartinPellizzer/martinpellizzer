                    <h1>Elaeophorbia hiernii</h1>
<p>Elaeophorbia hiernii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care.</p>
<p>Elaeophorbia hiernii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
