                    <h1>Epilobium griseum</h1>
<p>Epilobium griseum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Epilobium griseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
