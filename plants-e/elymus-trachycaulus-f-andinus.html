                    <h1>Elymus trachycaulus f. andinus</h1>
<p>Elymus trachycaulus f. andinus, commonly known as the Andean roughgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient soils, making it a resilient species in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
