                    <h1>Eragrostis pusilla</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pusilla, commonly known as dwarf lovegrass, is a small annual grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and has fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low growth habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ground cover.</p>
