<p>Eria pokharensis, commonly known as the Pokhara orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and strikingly colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria pokharensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
