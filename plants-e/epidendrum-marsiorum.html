<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, which are borne on thick, fleshy stems. The plant has broad, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Epidendrum marsiorum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
