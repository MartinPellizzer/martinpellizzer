                    <h1>Ebermaiera stolonifera var. nana</h1>
<p>Ebermaiera stolonifera var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf stoloniferous evergreen, is a low-growing plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous nature allows it to spread vegetatively, forming thick ground cover in suitable habitats.</p>
