                    <h1>Euphorbia emarginata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia emarginata, commonly known as the margined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, branched stem covered in thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
