<p>Elytrigia strigosa subsp.</p>
<p>jacutorum, commonly known as seaside grass or beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used for dune stabilization due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
