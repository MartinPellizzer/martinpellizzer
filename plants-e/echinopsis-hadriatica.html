<p>Echinopsis hadriatica, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a succulent cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
