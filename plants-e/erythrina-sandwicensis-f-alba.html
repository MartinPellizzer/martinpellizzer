<p>Erythrina sandwicensis f. alba, commonly known as the white ʻōhia, is a rare variant of the ʻōhia tree native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange blooms of the species. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native Hawaiian forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
