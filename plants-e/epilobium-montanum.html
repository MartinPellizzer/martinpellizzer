                    <h1>Epilobium montanum</h1>
<p>Epilobium montanum, commonly known as mountain willow, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Epilobium montanum is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
