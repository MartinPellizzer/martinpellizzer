                    <h1>Eucalyptus roycei</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus roycei, commonly known as the Royal gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a range of colors, from white to grey. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue and a rough upper surface. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and coastal ecosystems.</p>
