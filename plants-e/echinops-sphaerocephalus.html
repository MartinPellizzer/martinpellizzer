<p>Echinops sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiky blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by dense, white to grayish bracts. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers that develop into achene fruits with pappus structures for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinops sphaerocephalus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
