<p>Echinops aberdaricus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant has silver-gray foliage and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Echinops aberdaricus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
