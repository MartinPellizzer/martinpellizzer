                    <h1>Echinocereus × roetteri var. lloydii</h1>
<p>Echinocereus × roetteri var. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright green, spiny stems that form a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
