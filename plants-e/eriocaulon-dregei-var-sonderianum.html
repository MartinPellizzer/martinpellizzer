                    <h1>Eriocaulon dregei var. sonderianum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon dregei var. sonderianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in its natural environment.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
