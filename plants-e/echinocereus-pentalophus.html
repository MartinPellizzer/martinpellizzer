                    <h1>Echinocereus pentalophus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus pentalophus, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, globular shape and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its fleshy stems store water, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, and the plant is also known for its edible fruit, though it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
