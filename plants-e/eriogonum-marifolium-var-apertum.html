<p>Eriogonum marifolium var. apertum, commonly known as the openleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
