<p>Erigeron asteroides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its daisy-like appearance, featuring blue to purple flower heads surrounded by white to grayish-blue ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a showy display of flowers from late summer into early fall.</p>
