                    <h1>Equisetum arvense</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in early spring. Field horsetail thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
