                    <h1>Evota</h1>
<p>Evota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a unique epiphyte. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical name, Dendrophylax lindenii, reflects its growth habit on tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
