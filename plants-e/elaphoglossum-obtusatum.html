<p>Elaphoglossum obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-lobed holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum obtusatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
