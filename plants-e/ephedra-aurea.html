                    <h1>Ephedra aurea</h1>
<p>Ephedra aurea, commonly known as golden ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods. Ephedra aurea is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>It is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
