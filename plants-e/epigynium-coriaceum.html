<p>Epigynium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough epigynium, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, thick foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant's structure includes a short, woody stem with dense, clustered leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish in color, and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
