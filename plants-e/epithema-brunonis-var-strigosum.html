<p>Epithema brunonis var. strigosum, commonly known as the hairy epithema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, brownish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small, inconspicuous white flowers appear in late spring, followed by cylindrical seed pods that split open to disperse seeds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>
