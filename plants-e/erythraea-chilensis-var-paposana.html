<p>Erythraea chilensis var. paposana, commonly known as the Chilean erythraea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of central Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
