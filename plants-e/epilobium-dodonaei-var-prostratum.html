                    <h1>Epilobium dodonaei var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Epilobium dodonaei var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate willowherb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or cushions, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens.</p>
