<p>Eleocharis aurea, commonly known as golden spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually golden or reddish in color. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis aurea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
