                    <h1>Epidorchis</h1>
<p>Epidorchis, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidorchis species typically have showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, often featuring a distinctive lip or spur. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and require well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations to their specific habitats.</p>
