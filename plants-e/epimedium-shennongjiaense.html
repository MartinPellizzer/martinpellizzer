<p>Epimedium shennongjiaense, commonly known as the Shennongjia barrenwort, is a rare evergreen herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
