<p>Eriocaulon robustium var. perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>The variety perpusillum is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Eriocaulon robustium.</p>
