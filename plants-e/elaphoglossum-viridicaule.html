<p>Elaphoglossum viridicaule, commonly known as the green-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Elaphoglossum viridicaule thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
