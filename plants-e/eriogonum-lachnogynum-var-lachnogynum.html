<p>Eriogonum lachnogynum var. lachnogynum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give the leaves a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important species for ecological restoration in dry regions.</p>
