                    <h1>Euphorbia theriaca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia theriaca, commonly known as the "bark-leaf euphorbia," is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and reduced leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a spiny, branched structure with a distinctive appearance that makes it stand out in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and adaptability to arid conditions, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
