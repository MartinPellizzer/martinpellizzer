<p>Eunomia orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color and has a rounded, leaf-like appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Eunomia orbiculata is commonly used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
