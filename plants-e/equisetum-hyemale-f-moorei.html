<p>Equisetum hyemale f. moorei, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem that persists through winter, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called strobili, are clustered at the tips of the fronds and are typically found in late spring.</p>
<p>The fern's unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
