<p>Euphorbia atrococca, commonly known as the Black Spine Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with spiny, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments.</p>
