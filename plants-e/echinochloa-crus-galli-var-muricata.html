                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. muricata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. muricata, commonly known as cockleburgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth habit and distinctive, spiny seed heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a spiny, three-lobed casing, which aids in their dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing.</p>
