<p>Eucalyptus yarraensis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed malletwood, is a tall evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its bark is typically smooth and peels off in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus yarraensis is well adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands.</p>
