<p>Elaphoglossum rubiginosum, commonly known as the rusty elaphoglossum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
