<p>Eriosyce strausiana subsp.</p>
<p>bisii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra Cactus, is a perennial plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its columnar stem with dense, woolly spines and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a shallow root system adapted to the arid environment, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its unique morphology includes a branching pattern that resembles a candelabra, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for desert wildlife.</p>
