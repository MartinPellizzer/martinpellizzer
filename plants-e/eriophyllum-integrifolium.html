                    <h1>Eriophyllum integrifolium</h1>
<p>Eriophyllum integrifolium, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, white, woolly foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no serrations or lobes, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Eriophyllum integrifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
