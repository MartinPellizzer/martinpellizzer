                    <h1>Elwendia salsa</h1>
<p>Elwendia salsa, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Elwendia salsa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and a valuable plant for ecological restoration in desert landscapes.</p>
