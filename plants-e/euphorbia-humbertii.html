                    <h1>Euphorbia humbertii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a striking plant native to the Alps, particularly in France and Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem and surrounding bracts that resemble flowers, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, green, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Euphorbia humbertii is also notable for its latex, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
