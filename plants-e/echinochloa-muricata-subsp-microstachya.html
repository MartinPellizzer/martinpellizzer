<p>Echinochloa muricata subsp.</p>
<p>microstachya, commonly known as rough false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas, though it also plays a role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats.</p>
