                    <h1>Echinocereus chloranthus var. neocapillus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus chloranthus var. neocapillus, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue-green stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its succulent structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
