                    <h1>Euphorbia nesiotica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nesiotica, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and striking species.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nesiotica is also notable for its potential medicinal properties and its role in the unique ecosystem of Socotra.</p>
