                    <h1>Euphorbia minutiflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf leaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among many members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
