<p>Epidendrum trianthum, commonly known as the Three-flowered Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, horizontal rhizome and produces multiple pseudobulbs covered in a dense layer of brownish to grayish roots. The plant typically bears clusters of small, pale green to white flowers with three petals and three sepals, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum trianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
