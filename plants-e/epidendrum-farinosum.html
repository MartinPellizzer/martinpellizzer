<p>Epidendrum farinosum, commonly known as the dusty epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>

It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum farinosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
