                    <h1>Eritrichium subrupestre</h1>
<p>Eritrichium subrupestre, commonly known as the rock erin, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to rocky slopes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
