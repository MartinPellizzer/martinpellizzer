<p>Elymus caianus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often hairless leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Elymus caianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
