                    <h1>Eriocoma grandiflora</h1>
<p>Eriocoma grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered eriocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system makes it somewhat drought-tolerant, though it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Eriocoma grandiflora is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
