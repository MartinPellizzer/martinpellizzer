                    <h1>Elymus dahuricus var. cziticus</h1>
<p>Elymus dahuricus var. cziticus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with leathery, awned glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
