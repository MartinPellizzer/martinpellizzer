                    <h1>Encholirium belemii</h1>
<p>Encholirium belemii, commonly known as the Belem giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the humid forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in bromeliads. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Encholirium belemii is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
