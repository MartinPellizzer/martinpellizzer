                    <h1>Equisetum kansanum f. polystachyum</h1>
<p>Equisetum kansanum f. polystachyum, commonly known as the tall branch fern, is a variant of the scaly horse-tail plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a trait common among primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
