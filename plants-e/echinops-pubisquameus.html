<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads composed of tightly packed, bristly bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinops pubisquameus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
