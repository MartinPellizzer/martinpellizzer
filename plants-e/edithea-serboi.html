<p>Edithea serboi, commonly known as the Serboi fern, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests where it attaches itself to rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing leaves, are essential for its propagation in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Edithea serboi is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
