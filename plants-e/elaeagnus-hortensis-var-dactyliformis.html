                    <h1>Elaeagnus hortensis var. dactyliformis</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus hortensis var. dactyliformis, commonly known as the silverleaf elaeagnus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in early spring, followed by edible, orange-yellow berries. It has a shallow root system that makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique leaf color and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
