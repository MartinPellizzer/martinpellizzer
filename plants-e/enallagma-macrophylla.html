<p>Enallagma macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved jewelwing, is a species of damselfly found in freshwater habitats across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue and green coloration in males, which is used for attracting mates and territorial displays. The plant-like appearance of its wings and body gives it a unique resemblance to certain flowering plants. Its larvae develop in still or slow-moving water, where they feed on aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems as both predator and prey.</p>
