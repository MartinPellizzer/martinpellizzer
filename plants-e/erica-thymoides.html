                    <h1>Erica thymoides</h1>
<p>Erica thymoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica thymoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
