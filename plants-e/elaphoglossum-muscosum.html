                    <h1>Elaphoglossum muscosum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum muscosum, commonly known as the mossy holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
