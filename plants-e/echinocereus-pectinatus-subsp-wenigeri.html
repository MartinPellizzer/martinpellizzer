<p>Echinocereus pectinatus subsp.</p>
<p>wenigeri, commonly known as the lesser prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, shrub-like plant with a dense covering of spines and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible, pear-shaped fruits known as tunas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to desert gardens.</p>
