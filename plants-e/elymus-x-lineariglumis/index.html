<p>Elymus × lineariglumis is a hybrid grass species known for its unique combination of traits from its parent plants. It is commonly found in semi-arid regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and erosion control. Its tall, slender stalks make it a distinctive feature in native plant landscapes. Despite its hardy nature, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
