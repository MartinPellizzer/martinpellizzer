                    <h1>Erodium tmoleum</h1>
<p>Erodium tmoleum, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and covered in a sticky substance, which helps them adhere to animals and clothing for dispersal.</p>
<p>Erodium tmoleum is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
