                    <h1>Eremocarya lepida</h1>
<p>Eremocarya lepida, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
