<p>Elegia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Elegia cuspidata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous species.</p>
