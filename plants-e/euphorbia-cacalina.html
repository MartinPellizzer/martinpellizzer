                    <h1>Euphorbia cacalina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cacalina, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling the plant requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cacalina plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
