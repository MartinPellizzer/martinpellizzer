<p>Euphorbia obesa subsp.</p>
<p>symmetrica, commonly known as the "Blossom Ball," is a compact, globular cactus native to South Africa. It features a dense, rounded stem covered in short, white bristles that give it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique shape and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings.</p>
