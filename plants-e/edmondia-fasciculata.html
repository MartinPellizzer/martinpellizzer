                    <h1>Edmondia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Edmondia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It has thin, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Edmondia fasciculata is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
