<p>Echinocactus mammulosus, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny, woolly covering that provides protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are cylindrical and often branching, with a thick, fleshy structure that stores water.</p>
<p>Echinocactus mammulosus produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior.</p>
