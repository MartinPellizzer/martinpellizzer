                <h1>Echinopsis aurea</h1>
<p>Echinopsis aurea, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, globular shape, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Echinopsis aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
