                    <h1>Epiphorella victoriae</h1>
<p>Epiphorella victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's epiphyte, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its growth is closely tied to humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
