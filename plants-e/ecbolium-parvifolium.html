                    <h1>Ecbolium parvifolium</h1>
<p>Ecbolium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, ovate leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ecbolium parvifolium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
