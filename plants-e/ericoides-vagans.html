<p>Ericoides vagans, commonly known as the wandering ericoid, is a rare and elusive plant species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
