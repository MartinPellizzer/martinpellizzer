<p>Elymus trachycaulus subsp.</p>
<p>donianus, commonly known as the Donian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, needle-like leaves that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
