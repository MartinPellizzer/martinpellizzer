                    <h1>Echinopsilon crassifolius</h1>
<p>Echinopsilon crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed echinops, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and large, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
