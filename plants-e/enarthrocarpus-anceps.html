                    <h1>Enarthrocarpus anceps</h1>
<p>Enarthrocarpus anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark, leathery fruits. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
