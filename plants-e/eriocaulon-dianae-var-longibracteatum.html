                    <h1>Eriocaulon dianae var. longibracteatum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon dianae var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract eriocaulon, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower clusters, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
