                    <h1>Euphorbia clementei var. euclementei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia clementei var. euclementei, commonly known as the Blue Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking blue-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, rather than typical flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
