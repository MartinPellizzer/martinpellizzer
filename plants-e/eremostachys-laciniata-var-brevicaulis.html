<p>Eremostachys laciniata var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries.</p>
