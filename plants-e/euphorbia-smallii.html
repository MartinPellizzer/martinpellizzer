<p>Euphorbia smallii, commonly known as the smallii spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a short, stocky stem with a thick, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a bluish-gray hue, providing a striking visual contrast.</p>
<p>Euphorbia smallii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
