<p>Euphorbia abramsiana, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Euphorbia abramsiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
