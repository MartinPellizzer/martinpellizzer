                    <h1>Endiandra palmerstonii</h1>
<p>Endiandra palmerstonii, commonly known as the Palmerston's endiandra, is a rare and unique rainforest tree native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tropical trees, though it is one of the few species in this family found in Australia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
