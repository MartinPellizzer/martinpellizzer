                    <h1>Eupatorium cannabifolium</h1>
<p>Eupatorium cannabifolium, commonly known as Indian hemp or hempweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of Cannabis sativa. The plant produces small, clustered white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to cannabis, it has been historically misidentified and sometimes confused with marijuana.</p>
