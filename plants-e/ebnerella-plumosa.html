                    <h1>Ebnerella plumosa</h1>
<p>Ebnerella plumosa, commonly known as the featherleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery thallus that gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a layered cortex, medulla, and upper cortex, typical of foliose lichens.</p>
<p>Ebnerella plumosa is often found on decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems.</p>
