                    <h1>Elaphoglossum coriifolium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum coriifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that give it a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum coriifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
