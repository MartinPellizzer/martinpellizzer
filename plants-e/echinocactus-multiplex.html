<p>Echinocactus multiplex, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus multiplex is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
