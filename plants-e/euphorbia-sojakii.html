<p>Euphorbia sojakii, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or green. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in dry environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which further minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sojakii is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
