                    <h1>Ervatamia celastroides</h1>
<p>Ervatamia celastroides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Ervatamia celastroides is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
