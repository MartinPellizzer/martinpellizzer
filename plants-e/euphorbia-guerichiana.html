<p>Euphorbia guerichiana, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves and a flowering structure called a cyathium, which contains small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia guerichiana is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
