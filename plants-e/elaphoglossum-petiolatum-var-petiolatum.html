<p>Elaphoglossum petiolatum var. petiolatum, commonly known as the petiolate holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which contribute to its distinctive, elegant foliage.</p>
