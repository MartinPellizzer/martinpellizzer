<p>Equisetum arvense subsp.</p>
<p>agreste, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is notable for its primitive morphology, resembling ancient plants from the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
