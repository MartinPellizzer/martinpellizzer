<p>Epidendrum prasinum, commonly known as the Emerald Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Epidendrum prasinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate for indoor or greenhouse settings.</p>
