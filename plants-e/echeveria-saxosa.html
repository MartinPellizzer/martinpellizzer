<p>Echeveria saxosa, commonly known as the Mexican Snowflake, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white to pink flowers during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is ideal for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
