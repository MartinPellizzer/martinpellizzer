                    <h1>Eisocreochiton bracteatus</h1>
<p>Eisocreochiton bracteatus, commonly known as the bracteate ice beetle, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, shield-like body covered in a layer of secreted honeydew. The plant it infests is typically a host within the family Euphorbiaceae, particularly species of the genus Croton. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pest on ornamental and agricultural plants.</p>
<p>The insect's presence can lead to sooty mold growth due to the accumulation of its excretions on plant surfaces.</p>
