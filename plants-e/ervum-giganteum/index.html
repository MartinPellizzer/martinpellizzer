                            <h1>Ervum Giganteum</h1>
<p>Giant pea, scientifically known as Ervum giganteum, is a strikingly large legume native to the Mediterranean region. This plant is notable for its impressive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over six meters. Its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers make it a striking addition to any garden. Despite its size, the Giant pea is relatively easy to grow, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. It has become a popular choice for both ornamental and experimental horticulture due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
