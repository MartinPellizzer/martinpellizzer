<p>Elaphoglossum hispaniolicum, commonly known as the Spanish rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 20 cm in length. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit, with leaves arranged in a tight circle around the central stem. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
