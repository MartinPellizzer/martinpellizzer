                    <h1>Euphorbia robecchii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia robecchii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive branching structure with spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia robecchii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
