<p>Echeveria decumbens var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
