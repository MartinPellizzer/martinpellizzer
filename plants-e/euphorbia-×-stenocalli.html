<p>Euphorbia × stenocalli, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a hybrid plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and narrow, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
