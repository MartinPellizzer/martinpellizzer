                    <h1>Encephalosphaera vitellina</h1>
<p>Encephalosphaera vitellina, commonly known as the yellow cup lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-brown thallus, which is typically flattened and leaf-like in appearance. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the genus Ascomycota. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on tree bark or rocks.</p>
<p>Encephalosphaera vitellina is widely distributed across temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
