<p>Euphorbia pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant has smooth, green stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and alternate, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pedunculata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
