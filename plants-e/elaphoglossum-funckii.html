<p>Elaphoglossum funckii, commonly known as the Funck's harts-tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
