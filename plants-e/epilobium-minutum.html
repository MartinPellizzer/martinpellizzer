                    <h1>Epilobium minutum</h1>
<p>Epilobium minutum, commonly known as small willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, pinkish-purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Epilobium minutum plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
