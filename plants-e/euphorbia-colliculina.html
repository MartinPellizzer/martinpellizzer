<p>Euphorbia colliculina, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia colliculina is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
