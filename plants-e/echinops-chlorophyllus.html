The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinops chlorophyllus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
