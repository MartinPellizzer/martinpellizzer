                    <h1>Equisetum palustre var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Equisetum palustre var. prostratum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features whorled, needle-like leaves that are typically green and slightly rough to the touch. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It has a long evolutionary history and is one of the few surviving members of the ancient order Equisetales.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, spreading along the ground to form dense mats.</p>
