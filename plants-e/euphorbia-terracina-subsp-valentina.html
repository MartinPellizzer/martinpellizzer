<p>Euphorbia terracina subsp.</p>
<p>valentina, commonly known as the Valentina spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
