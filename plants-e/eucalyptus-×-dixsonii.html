                    <h1>Eucalyptus × dixsonii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × dixsonii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, which appear during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus × dixsonii is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
