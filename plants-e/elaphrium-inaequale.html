                    <h1>Elaphrium inaequale</h1>
<p>Elaphrium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal elaphrium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in complex umbels, which are typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Elaphrium inaequale is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
