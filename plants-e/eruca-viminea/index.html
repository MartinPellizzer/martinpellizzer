                            <h1>Eruca Viminea</h1>
<p>Celtuce, scientifically known as Eruca viminea, is a versatile and nutritious leafy green vegetable widely cultivated in East Asia. It is prized for its mild, slightly peppery flavor and tender, crisp leaves that are ideal for salads, stir-fries, and soups. Despite its name, which may confuse it with other members of the Brassica family, Celtuce is botanically distinct and belongs to the Brassicaceae family. Its unique appearance, with thick, fleshy leaves and a rosette-like growth pattern, makes it a visually appealing addition to gardens and culinary dishes. With its adaptability to various climates and growing conditions, Celtuce has become a popular choice for both home gardeners and commercial farmers.</p>
