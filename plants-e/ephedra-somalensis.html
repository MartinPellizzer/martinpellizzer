<p>Ephedra somalensis, commonly known as the Somali ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
