                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. diffusum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. diffusum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant characterized by its abundance of spore-bearing cones and a distinctive, hollow stem.</p>
<p>It is a primitive vascular plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant's stems are segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures, which contribute to its unique appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common to many ancient plant species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is often considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
