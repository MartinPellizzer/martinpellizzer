                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. mackayi</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typical of the Equisetaceae family. Its stems are hollow and contain a high concentration of silica, contributing to its rigid structure.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
