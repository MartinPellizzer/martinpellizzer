                    <h1>Euphorbia garkeana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia garkeana, commonly known as the Karoo euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, and its growth habit makes it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
