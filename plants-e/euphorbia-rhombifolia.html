<p>Euphorbia rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamondleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, diamond-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
