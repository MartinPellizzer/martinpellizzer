                    <h1>Echinopsis × nigerrima</h1>
<p>Echinopsis × nigerrima, commonly known as the Black Thorn Cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Echinopsis chamaecereus and Echinopsis leucodermis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in a dark, almost black, bark-like coating. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is native to arid regions of South America and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and unique features, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping.</p>
