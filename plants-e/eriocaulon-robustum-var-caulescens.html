                    <h1>Eriocaulon robustum var. caulescens</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon robustum var. caulescens, commonly known as the robust marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a caulescent growth habit, meaning it has an upright stem rather than being prostrate, which distinguishes it from other varieties in the genus. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers, typical of the Eriocaulaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in moist habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
