                    <h1>Echinocactus sclerothrix</h1>
<p>Echinocactus sclerothrix, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered with thick, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance plant in arid gardens.</p>
