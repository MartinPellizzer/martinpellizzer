<p>Echeandia sanmiguelensis, commonly known as the San Miguel's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
