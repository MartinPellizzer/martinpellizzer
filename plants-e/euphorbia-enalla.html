                    <h1>Euphorbia enalla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia enalla, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic and is often used as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia enalla thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
