<p>Elytraria tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Elytraria tridentata is notable for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
