                    <h1>Erysimum albidum</h1>
<p>Erysimum albidum, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically scale-like and reduced. Erysimum albidum is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge to cultivate in gardens.</p>
