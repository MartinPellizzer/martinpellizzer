                    <h1>Echeveria reglensis</h1>
<p>Echeveria reglensis, commonly known as the Mexican snowball, is a succulent native to the Mexican states of Jalisco and Nayarit.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
