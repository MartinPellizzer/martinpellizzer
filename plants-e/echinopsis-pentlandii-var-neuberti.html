                    <h1>Echinopsis pentlandii var. neuberti</h1>
<p>Echinopsis pentlandii var. neuberti, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a hybrid cactus species that combines the spineless columnar stem of *Hylocereus* with the colorful, spherical head of *Echinopsis pentlandii*.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water and its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in succulent gardens.</p>
