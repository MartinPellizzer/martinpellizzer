                    <h1>Euphorbion</h1>
<p>Euphorbion, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Many species of Euphorbion are succulents, adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers known as cyathia, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbion species are widely distributed across tropical and warm temperate regions, with many being cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
