                    <h1>Eragrostis scabrida</h1>
<p>Eragrostis scabrida, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Eragrostis scabrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
