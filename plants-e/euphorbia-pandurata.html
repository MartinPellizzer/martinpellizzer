                    <h1>Euphorbia pandurata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pandurata, commonly known as the palmate spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a short, thick trunk and a crown of fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that radiate outward. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pandurata is adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky soils.</p>
