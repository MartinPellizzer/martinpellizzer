                    <h1>Euphorbia spinidens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinidens, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia spinidens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
