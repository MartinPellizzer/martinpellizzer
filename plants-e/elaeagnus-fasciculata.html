                    <h1>Elaeagnus fasciculata</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus fasciculata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red color in late summer. Elaeagnus fasciculata is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for soil stabilization and wildlife habitat.</p>
