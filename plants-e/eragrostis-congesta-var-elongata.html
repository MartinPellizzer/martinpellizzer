                    <h1>Eragrostis congesta var. elongata</h1>
<p>Eragrostis congesta var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping, arching inflorescences that give it a weeping appearance, and its slender, hairless leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique foliage structure.</p>
