                    <h1>Elaphoglossum perangustum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum perangustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huperzia, is a small fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity and ecological adaptation.</p>
