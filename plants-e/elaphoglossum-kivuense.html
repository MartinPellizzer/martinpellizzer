                    <h1>Elaphoglossum kivuense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum kivuense, commonly known as the Kivu holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock faces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
