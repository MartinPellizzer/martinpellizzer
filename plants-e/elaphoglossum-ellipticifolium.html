<p>Elaphoglossum ellipticifolium, commonly known as the elliptic-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent in some varieties, which is a rare trait among ferns.</p>
