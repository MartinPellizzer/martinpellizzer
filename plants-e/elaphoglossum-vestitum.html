                    <h1>Elaphoglossum vestitum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light of the canopy. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum vestitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
