<p>Eriogonum cernuum var. viminale, commonly known as the creeping buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects.</p>
