<p>Epipactis greuteri subsp.</p>
<p>flaminia, commonly known as the Flaminian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive hooded lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, elliptical seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarity to other members of the Epipactis genus, making it challenging to distinguish without close examination.</p>
