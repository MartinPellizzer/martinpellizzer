                    <h1>Ephedra major var. nebrodensis</h1>
<p>Ephedra major var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden ephedra, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in harsh, dry environments and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
