<p>Eragrostis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains.</p>
<p>Eragrostis hirsuta is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to establish dense vegetation.</p>
