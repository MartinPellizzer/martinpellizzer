                    <h1>Erodium maritimum f. apetalum</h1>
<p>Erodium maritimum f. apetalum, commonly known as the coastal erodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and reduced floral structures. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its flowers, which are often sterile or reduced in the apetalum form, contribute to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptability.</p>
