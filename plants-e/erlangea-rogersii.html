<p>Erlangea rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' erlangea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Erlangea rogersii is considered endangered in many of its native ranges.</p>
