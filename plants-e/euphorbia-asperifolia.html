<p>Euphorbia asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
