                    <h1>Echinops gaillardotii</h1>
<p>Echinops gaillardotii, commonly known as the Gaillardot's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature of the Echinops genus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinops gaillardotii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
