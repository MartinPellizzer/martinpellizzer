                    <h1>Euphorbia trigonosperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia trigonosperma, commonly known as the triangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
