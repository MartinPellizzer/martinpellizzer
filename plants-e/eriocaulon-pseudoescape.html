<p>Eriocaulon pseudoescape, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
