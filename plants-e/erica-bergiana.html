                    <h1>Erica bergiana</h1>
<p>Erica bergiana, commonly known as the silver-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a silvery-gray appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late summer. Erica bergiana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing shrubs.</p>
