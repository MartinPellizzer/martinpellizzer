                    <h1>Ellisia torreyi var. bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Ellisia torreyi var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the twin-needle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a lacy, intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rich forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
