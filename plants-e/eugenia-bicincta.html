<p>Eugenia bicincta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when dry, contributing to its ecological role in native habitats.</p>
<p>Eugenia bicincta is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
