<p>Ebenus tessellaria, commonly known as the mosaic everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, tightly packed flowers that range in color from white to pink, giving it a distinctive, almost mosaic-like appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Ebenus tessellaria is also valued for its long-lasting blooms, which remain intact even when dried.</p>
