                    <h1>Erysimum canescens var. welchevii</h1>
<p>Erysimum canescens var. welchevii, commonly known as the desert wallflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and profuse display of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically borne in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
