                    <h1>Echinopsis fallax var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Echinopsis fallax var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfalls. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
