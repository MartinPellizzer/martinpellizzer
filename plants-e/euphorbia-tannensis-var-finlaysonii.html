                    <h1>Euphorbia tannensis var. finlaysonii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tannensis var. finlaysonii, commonly known as the Finlayson's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by unique, bead-like seed pods. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, contributing to its defensive adaptations.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
