<p>Epipactis palustris f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh helleborine, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several flowers, each with a unique structure that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
