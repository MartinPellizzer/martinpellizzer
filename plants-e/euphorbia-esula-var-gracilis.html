<p>Euphorbia esula var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
