                    <h1>Echidnopsis serpentina</h1>
<p>Echidnopsis serpentina, commonly known as the serpent's tail succulent, is a striking member of the Aizoaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of fleshy, cylindrical leaves that resemble a serpent's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a bold contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
