                    <h1>Erythropsis colorata</h1>
<p>Erythropsis colorata, commonly known as the red-flowered lichen, is a unique species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming crust-like structures that help it retain moisture. The plant's vibrant red coloration is primarily due to the presence of carotenoid pigments produced by the algal component. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated regions with minimal competition.</p>
