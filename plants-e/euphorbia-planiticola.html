                    <h1>Euphorbia planiticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia planiticola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia planiticola is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
