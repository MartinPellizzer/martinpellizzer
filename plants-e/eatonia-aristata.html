                    <h1>Eatonia aristata</h1>
<p>Eatonia aristata, commonly known as the silver-tipped orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique foliage features a silvery sheen, which helps reflect excess light and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eatonia aristata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
