<p>Echinocereus uehri, commonly known as the Uehri's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with distinctive spiny, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by various insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinocereus uehri thrives in arid environments and is well-adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
