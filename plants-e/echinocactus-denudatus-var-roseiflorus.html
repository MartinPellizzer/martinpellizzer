                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus var. roseiflorus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus var. roseiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in spiny, greenish-gray ribs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink to rose-colored flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
