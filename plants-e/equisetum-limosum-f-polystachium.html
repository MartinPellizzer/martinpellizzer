                    <h1>Equisetum limosum f. polystachium</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum f. polystachium, commonly known as the swamp willow horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. This variety is typically found in moist, acidic soils near water bodies such as marshes and wetlands. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its stems can persist through winter, making it a perennial plant.</p>
<p>The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
