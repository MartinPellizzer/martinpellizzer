                    <h1>Echinocereus bristolii var. pseudopectinatus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus bristolii var. pseudopectinatus, commonly known as the Bristol prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Its succulent stems store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The variety pseudopectinatus is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Echinocereus bristolii.</p>
