                            <h1>Enkleia Siamensis Subsp. Andamanica</h1>
<p>Enkleia andamanica, scientifically known as Enkleia siamensis subsp. andamanica, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Andaman Islands. This flowering plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Enkleia andamanica is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts. Its unique ecological role and aesthetic appeal make it an important subject for botanical study and environmental preservation.</p>
