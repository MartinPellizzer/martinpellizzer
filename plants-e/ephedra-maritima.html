                    <h1>Ephedra maritima</h1>
<p>Ephedra maritima, commonly known as sea ephedra, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and red or orange fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in restoration projects.</p>
