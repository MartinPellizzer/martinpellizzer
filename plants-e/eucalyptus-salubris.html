                    <h1>Eucalyptus salubris</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus salubris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is typically rough and fibrous, peeling in strips to reveal a smoother underlayer.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus salubris is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions.</p>
