                    <h1>Erica flacca</h1>
<p>Erica flacca, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has wiry, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica flacca is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive floral display.</p>
