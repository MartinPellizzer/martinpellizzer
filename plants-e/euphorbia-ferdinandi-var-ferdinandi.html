                    <h1>Euphorbia ferdinandi var. ferdinandi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ferdinandi var. ferdinandi, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
