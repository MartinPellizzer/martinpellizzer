                    <h1>Euphorbia vulcanorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vulcanorum, commonly known as the Vulcan's spurge, is a unique plant native to the volcanic soils of Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid, nutrient-poor environments, making it well adapted to volcanic landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
