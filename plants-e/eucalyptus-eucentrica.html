                    <h1>Eucalyptus eucentrica</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus eucentrica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a grey-green color and a rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale pink, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus eucentrica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
