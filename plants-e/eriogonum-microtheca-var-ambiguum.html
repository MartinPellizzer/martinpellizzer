                    <h1>Eriogonum microtheca var. ambiguum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum microtheca var. ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its variability in leaf shape and floral structure, which contributes to its classification as a variant.</p>
