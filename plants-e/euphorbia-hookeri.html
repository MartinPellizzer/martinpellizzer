<p>Euphorbia hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
