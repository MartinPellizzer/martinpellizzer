<p>Epilobium glandulosum var. exaltatum, commonly known as the tall willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
