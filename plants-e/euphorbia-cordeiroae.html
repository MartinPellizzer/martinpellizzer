                    <h1>Euphorbia cordeiroae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cordeiroae, commonly known as the Portuguese euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Azores Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and xeriscaping enthusiasts.</p>
