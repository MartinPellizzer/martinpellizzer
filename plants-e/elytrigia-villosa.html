<p>Elytrigia villosa, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike or a few spikes, with small, pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Elytrigia villosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
