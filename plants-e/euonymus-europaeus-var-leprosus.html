                    <h1>Euonymus europaeus var. leprosus</h1>
<p>Euonymus europaeus var. leprosus, commonly known as the European spurge or the white euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'leprosus' refers to the pale, almost white appearance of its leaves, which can give it a distinctive look in the landscape.</p>
