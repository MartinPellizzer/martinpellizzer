<p>Equisetum palustre var. membranaceum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its delicate, membranous sheaths on the stems.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the late spring and early summer. Its stems are jointed and have a hollow, needle-like appearance, with whorls of small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
