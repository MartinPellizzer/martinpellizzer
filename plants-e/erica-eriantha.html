                    <h1>Erica eriantha</h1>
<p>Erica eriantha, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, characterized by its dense, wiry stems and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and summer. Erica eriantha is well adapted to poor, sandy soils and is drought-resistant, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
