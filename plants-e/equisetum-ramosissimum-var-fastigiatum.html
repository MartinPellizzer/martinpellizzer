                    <h1>Equisetum ramosissimum var. fastigiatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, typically in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to tiny, tooth-like structures called sterigmas, which are used for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
