                    <h1>Euphorbia hypericifolia var. falciformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hypericifolia var. falciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
