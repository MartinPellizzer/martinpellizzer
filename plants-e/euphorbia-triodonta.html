<p>Euphorbia triodonta, commonly known as the three-toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia triodonta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
