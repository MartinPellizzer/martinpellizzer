<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with three petals and three sepals. The plant has a short, rhizomatous rootstock and produces a single stem that bears the floral display. Its foliage consists of three broad, heart-shaped leaves that emerge from the base.</p>
