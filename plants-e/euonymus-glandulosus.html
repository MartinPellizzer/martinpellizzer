                    <h1>Euonymus glandulosus</h1>
<p>Euonymus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often glandular-stipulate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, inflated seed capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
