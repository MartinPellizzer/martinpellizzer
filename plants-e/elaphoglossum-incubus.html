                    <h1>Elaphoglossum incubus</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum incubus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum incubus is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
