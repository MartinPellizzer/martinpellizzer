                    <h1>Eugenia littoralis</h1>
<p>Eugenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, thriving in saline and wind-exposed environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
