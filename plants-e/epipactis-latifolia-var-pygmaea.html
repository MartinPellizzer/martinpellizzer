<p>Epipactis latifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces sporangia that release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Epipactis latifolia.</p>
