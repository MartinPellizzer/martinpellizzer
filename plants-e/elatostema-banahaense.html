<p>Elatostema banahaense, commonly known as the Banahae Elatostemum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Elatostemaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
