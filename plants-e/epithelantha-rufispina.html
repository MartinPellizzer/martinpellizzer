                    <h1>Epithelantha rufispina</h1>
<p>Epithelantha rufispina, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in bright red spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Epithelantha rufispina is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable example of desert flora.</p>
