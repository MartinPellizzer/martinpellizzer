<p>Epigeneium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan epigeneium, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with a short, erect stem and broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
