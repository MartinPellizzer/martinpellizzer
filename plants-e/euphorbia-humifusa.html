                <h1>Euphorbia humifusa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it requires caution when handling.</p>
