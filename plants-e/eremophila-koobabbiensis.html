<p>Eremophila koobabbiensis, commonly known as the Koobabbin emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to drought and heat, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
