<p>Enkianthus reticulatus, commonly known as the reticulate enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has opposite, simple, and often serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Enkianthus reticulatus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively disease-resistant once established.</p>
