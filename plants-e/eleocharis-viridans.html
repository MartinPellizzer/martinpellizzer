                    <h1>Eleocharis viridans</h1>
<p>Eleocharis viridans, commonly known as green spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Eleocharis viridans is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
