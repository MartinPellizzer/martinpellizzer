<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Elytranthe colensoi is typically found in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
