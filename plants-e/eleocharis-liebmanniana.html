                    <h1>Eleocharis liebmanniana</h1>
<p>Eleocharis liebmanniana, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescences that produce tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Eleocharis liebmanniana is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
