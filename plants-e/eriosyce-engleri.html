<p>Eriosyce engleri, commonly known as the Engler's snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white, woolly flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, rounded shape with spiny stems that provide protection against herbivores. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriosyce engleri thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
