                <h1>angelica sinensis infusion</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Angelica sinensis, also known as dong quai, is a traditional Chinese herbal remedy often used to support women's health, particularly during menopause. The infusion is made by steeping dried roots of the plant in hot water, and it is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. However, its effectiveness and safety have not been extensively scientifically proven, and further research is needed to confirm its benefits and potential interactions with other medications.</p><p><a href="/herbs/angelica-sinensis.html">angelica sinensis</a></p>
