                <h1>ammi visnaga powder</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Ammi visnaga powder, also known as False Bishop's Weed or Khella, is derived from the seeds of the Ammi visnaga plant, native to the Mediterranean region. Traditionally used in herbal medicine, ammi visnaga powder has been employed to alleviate symptoms of respiratory issues, such as bronchitis and asthma, as well as to help lower blood pressure. However, its effectiveness and safety for human consumption have not been extensively studied, and its use should be approached with caution under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.</p><p><a href="/herbs/ammi-visnaga.html">ammi visnaga</a></p>
