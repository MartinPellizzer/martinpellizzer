                <h1>alpinia officinarum extract</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Alpinia officinarum extract, also known as galangal extract, is derived from the rhizome of the Alpinia officinarum plant, a member of the ginger family. This extract has been traditionally used in various cultures for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, as well as its potential to aid digestion and reduce nausea. Research has also suggested that galangal extract may have antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects, although more studies are needed to fully understand its benefits and applications.</p><p><a href="/herbs/alpinia-officinarum.html">alpinia officinarum</a></p>
