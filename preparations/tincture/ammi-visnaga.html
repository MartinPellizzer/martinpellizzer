                <h1>ammi visnaga tincture</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Ammi visnaga tincture is a herbal remedy derived from the seeds of the ammi visnaga plant, also known as khella or elephant's ear. Traditionally used in Middle Eastern and North African medicine, the tincture is valued for its potential to alleviate respiratory issues such as bronchitis and asthma, as well as its ability to lower blood pressure. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety for human use, and it should be consulted with a healthcare professional before being incorporated into a treatment plan.</p><p><a href="/herbs/ammi-visnaga.html">ammi visnaga</a></p>
