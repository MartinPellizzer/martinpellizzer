                <h1>artemisia annua oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Artemisia annua oil, also known as sweet wormwood oil, is a fragrant and medicinal oil extracted from the leaves and flowers of the Artemisia annua plant. This oil has been traditionally used for its antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, and is often used to treat various health issues, including fever, malaria, and digestive problems. However, due to its potential toxicity and side effects, artemisia annua oil should be used with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p><a href="/herbs/artemisia-annua.html">artemisia annua</a></p>
