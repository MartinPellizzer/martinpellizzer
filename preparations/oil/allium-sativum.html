                <h1>allium sativum oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Allium sativum oil, also known as garlic oil, is a highly concentrated extract obtained from garlic cloves through a process of cold-pressing or solvent extraction. This oil is rich in antioxidants and has been traditionally used in various cultures for its potential health benefits, including reducing inflammation and improving cardiovascular health. However, due to its strong flavor and potential toxicity, garlic oil should be used with caution and in moderation, ideally under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p><a href="/herbs/allium-sativum.html">allium sativum</a></p>
