                <h1>apium graveolens oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Apium graveolens oil, also known as celery seed oil, is a plant-derived essential oil extracted from the seeds of the celery plant. It has been traditionally used in aromatherapy for its potential benefits in reducing inflammation and improving digestion, as well as its ability to uplift and calm the mind. The oil's earthy and herbaceous aroma has also been used in perfumery and skincare products for its antioxidant and moisturizing properties.</p><p><a href="/herbs/apium-graveolens.html">apium graveolens</a></p>
