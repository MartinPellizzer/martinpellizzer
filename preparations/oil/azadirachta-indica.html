                <h1>azadirachta indica oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Azadirachta indica oil, also known as neem oil, is a natural oil extracted from the seeds of the neem tree. It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as an insecticide due to its antimicrobial and antifungal properties, making it effective against a wide range of pests and diseases. Neem oil is also used in skincare and haircare products due to its ability to soothe and calm irritated skin and scalp, reducing inflammation and promoting healthy growth.</p><p><a href="/herbs/azadirachta-indica.html">azadirachta indica</a></p>
