                <h1>ammi visnaga oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Ammi visnaga oil, also known as false bishop's weed or khella oil, is a plant-derived essential oil extracted from the seeds of the Ammi visnaga plant. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential benefits in treating respiratory issues such as bronchitis and asthma, as well as its effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular health. Ammi visnaga oil is often used in aromatherapy and herbal remedies, although more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for human use.</p><p><a href="/herbs/ammi-visnaga.html">ammi visnaga</a></p>
