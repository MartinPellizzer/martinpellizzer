                <h1>capsules</h1><h2>acorus calamus</h2><p>The capsule of Acorus calamus, also known as sweet flag, is a dry, dehiscent fruit that splits open to release its seeds. It is typically an elliptical or oval shape, with a ridged or winged appearance that helps in dispersal. The capsule usually contains 3-6 seeds, each surrounded by a fleshy, white aril that aids in seed dispersal through animals and water.</p><p><a href="/preparations/capsule/acorus-calamus.html">acorus calamus capsule</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>aesculus hippocastanum</h2><p>The Aesculus hippocastanum, or horse chestnut tree, produces a distinctive brown capsule that splits open to reveal several seeds.

The capsule is a dense, globular head containing numerous seeds, typically brown or gray in color, which are surrounded by a prickly, burs-like covering.
