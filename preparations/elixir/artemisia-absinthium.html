                <h1>artemisia absinthium elixir</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Artemisia absinthium elixir, also known as absinthe, is a herbal liqueur made from the flowers and leaves of the wormwood plant. Traditionally, it was brewed with other botanicals such as anise, fennel, and licorice root, resulting in a distinctive, slightly bitter flavor. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, absinthe gained notoriety for its association with artistic and literary figures, as well as its alleged psychoactive properties, although it was later banned in many countries due to concerns over its potential toxicity.</p><p><a href="/herbs/artemisia-absinthium.html">artemisia absinthium</a></p>
