                <h1>poultices</h1><h2>achillea millefolium</h2><p>Achillea millefolium, also known as yarrow, has been used for centuries to create a soothing poultice for wounds and injuries. The leaves and flowers of this plant are typically combined with a carrier oil, such as coconut or olive oil, to create a paste that can be applied directly to the affected area. When used as a poultice, achillea millefolium is said to promote healing, reduce inflammation, and prevent infection, making it a valuable remedy for minor cuts and scrapes.</p><p><a href="/preparations/poultices/achillea-millefolium.html">achillea millefolium poultice</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div>
