                <h1>capsules</h1><h2>aesculus hippocastanum</h2><p>The Aesculus hippocastanum, also known as the horse chestnut tree, produces a distinctive capsule that contains 2-3 seeds surrounded by a red or purple membrane. The capsule is typically 4-5 cm long, green when immature and tan or brown when mature. After it splits open, the seeds are dispersed, often carried away by wind or water, allowing the horse chestnut tree to propagate and spread its range.</p><p><a href="/preparations/capsules/allium-sativum.html">allium sativum capsule</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>allium sativum</h2><p>The Allium sativum capsule, also known as the garlic bulb capsule, is a structure that encloses the seeds of the garlic plant. It is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release the seeds, typically containing multiple seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. The capsule plays a crucial role in the reproduction and dispersal of garlic, allowing the plant to propagate and spread in its natural environment.</p><p><a href="/preparations/capsules/allium-sativum.html">allium sativum capsule</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div>
