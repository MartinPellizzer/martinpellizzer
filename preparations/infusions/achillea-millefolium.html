                    <h1>achillea millefolium infusion</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Achillea millefolium infusion, also known as yarrow tea, is a herbal remedy made from the flowers and leaves of the yarrow plant. It has been traditionally used to aid in digestion, reduce inflammation, and promote wound healing due to its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Drinking yarrow tea may also help to calm the nervous system and promote a restful sleep, although more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.</p><p><a href="/herbs/achillea-millefolium.html">achillea millefolium</a></p>
