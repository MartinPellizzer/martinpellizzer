                <h1>essential oils</h1><h2>artemisia absinthium</h2><p>Artemisia absinthium, also known as wormwood essential oil, is derived from the leaves and flowers of the wormwood plant and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and perfumery. This oil is known for its pungent, earthy, and slightly bitter aroma, which is often associated with absinthe, a classic spirit from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, it's worth noting that wormwood essential oil can be quite potent and should be used with caution, as it may cause skin irritation and other adverse effects in some individuals.</p><p><a href="/preparations/essential-oil/artemisia-absinthium.html">artemisia absinthium essential oil</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div>
