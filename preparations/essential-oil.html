                <h1>essential oils</h1><h2>artemisia absinthium</h2><p>Artemisia absinthium essential oil, also known as wormwood oil, is derived from the leaves of the wormwood plant and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. This oil is known for its potent, pungent aroma and is often used to promote digestion, relieve stress and anxiety, and repel insects. However, it's essential to use wormwood oil with caution, as excessive consumption can be toxic due to its high thujone content.</p><p><a href="/preparations/essential-oil/artemisia-absinthium.html">artemisia absinthium essential oil</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>achillea millefolium</h2><p>Achillea millefolium, also known as yarrow essential oil, is derived from the flowers of the yarrow plant and is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. This oil has been traditionally used to promote skin health, reduce inflammation and swelling, and even help to stop bleeding due to its astringent properties.
