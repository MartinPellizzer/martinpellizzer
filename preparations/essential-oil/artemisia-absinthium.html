                <h1>artemisia absinthium essential oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Artemisia absinthium essential oil, commonly known as wormwood oil, is derived from the leaves of the wormwood plant and has been used in traditional medicine and herbal remedies for centuries. The oil is known for its antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, making it effective in treating a range of health issues, from skin conditions to digestive problems. However, wormwood oil should be used with caution, as it can be toxic in large quantities and is not recommended for internal use due to its potential to cause liver damage and other health issues.</p><p><a href="/herbs/artemisia-absinthium.html">artemisia absinthium</a></p>
