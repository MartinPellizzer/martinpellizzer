                <h1>atropa belladonna infused oil</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>Atropa belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade, is a highly toxic plant that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, and its infused oil is often used in aromatherapy and homeopathic practices. The oil is typically made by infusing the plant's leaves and berries in a carrier oil, such as jojoba or sweet almond oil, under low heat and gentle agitation. Due to its potent and potentially hazardous properties, atropa belladonna infused oil should only be used under the guidance of a qualified practitioner or healthcare professional.</p><p><a href="/herbs/atropa-belladonna.html">atropa belladonna</a></p>
