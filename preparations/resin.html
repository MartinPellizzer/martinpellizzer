                <h1>resins</h1><h2>acorus calamus</h2><p>Acorus calamus resin, also known as calamus resin, is a resinous substance extracted from the root of the Acorus calamus plant, commonly found in Asia and Europe. Traditionally, it has been used in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine for its medicinal properties, including its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. The resin has also been used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent, particularly in the production of birch beer and other traditional beverages.</p><p><a href="/preparations/resin/acorus-calamus.html">acorus calamus resin</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>ammi visnaga</h2><p>Ammi visnaga resin, extracted from the seeds of the ammi visnaga plant, is a natural expectorant traditionally used to treat respiratory issues such as bronchitis, asthma, and coughs. Its expectorant properties help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe and cough up excess phlegm. The resin has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects.</p><p><a href="/preparations/resin/ammi-visnaga.html">ammi visnaga resin</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>artemisia absinthium</h2><p>Artemisia absinthium resin is a thick, sticky sap produced by the wormwood plant, a perennial herb native to Europe and Western Asia. This resin is often used in traditional medicine, particularly in herbalism and homeopathy, due to its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it's essential to note that artemisia absinthium resin can be toxic in large quantities and should be handled with caution by trained professionals only.</p><p><a href="/preparations/resin/artemisia-absinthium.html">artemisia absinthium resin</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>atropa belladonna</h2><p>Atropa belladonna resin is a highly toxic and potent derivative of the deadly nightshade plant, extracted through a process of solvent-based distillation. Its use is not recommended due to the extreme danger it poses, as even small amounts can cause severe poisoning and death. Historically, atropa belladonna resin has been used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices, although its use is now highly regulated and discouraged in modern times.</p><p><a href="/preparations/resin/atropa-belladonna.html">atropa belladonna resin</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>azadirachta indica</h2><p>Azadirachta indica resin, also known as neem resin, is a sticky substance extracted from the sap of the neem tree (Azadirachta indica). This resin has been used in traditional medicine for its antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its ability to repel insects and other pests. Research suggests that azadirachta indica resin may also have potential benefits in wound healing, skin care, and as a natural preservative in food and cosmetics applications.</p><p><a href="/preparations/resin/azadirachta-indica.html">azadirachta indica resin</a></p><div style="margin-bottom: 48px;"></div><h2>barosma betulina</h2><p>Barosma betulina, also known as the "Round-leaved Peppermint Tree", is a plant species native to South Africa.
