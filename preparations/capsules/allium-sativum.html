                    <h1>allium sativum capsule</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>The Allium sativum capsule, also known as the garlic bulb capsule, is a structure that encloses the seeds of the garlic plant. It is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release the seeds, typically containing multiple seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. The capsule plays a crucial role in the reproduction and dispersal of garlic, allowing the plant to propagate and spread in its natural environment.</p><p><a href="/herbs/allium-sativum.html">allium sativum</a></p>
