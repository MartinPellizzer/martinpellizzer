<p>[WRONG START] Walenia formonensis, commonly known as the Formosa wallenia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are typically broad and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
