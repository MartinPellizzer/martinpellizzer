                    <h1>Wormia nitida</h1>
<p>Wormia nitida, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is typically found in rocky crevices, forest floors, and damp soil, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Wormia nitida is a non-vascular plant, meaning it does not have a true vascular system for transporting water and nutrients.</p>
