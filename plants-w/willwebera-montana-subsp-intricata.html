<p>Willwebera montana subsp.</p>
<p>intricata, commonly known as the intricate willwebera, is a rare and distinctive member of the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its finely serrated, grass-like leaves and compact, clustered growth habit.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique morphology, including intricate leaf patterns and small, inconspicuous flowers, makes it a subject of interest for botanists.</p>
