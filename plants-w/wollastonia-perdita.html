                    <h1>Wollastonia perdita</h1>
<p>Wollastonia perdita, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often appear in pairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited to low-water environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
