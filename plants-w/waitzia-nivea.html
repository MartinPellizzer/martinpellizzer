<p>Waitzia nivea, commonly known as the snowy waitzia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant has a short, compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help insulate it from the cold mountain climate. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
