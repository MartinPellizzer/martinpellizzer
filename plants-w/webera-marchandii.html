<p>Webera marchandii, commonly known as the Marchand's webera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of La RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Webera marchandii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
