The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of black, inedible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its cold hardiness, it is often used in urban environments where it provides both aesthetic and environmental benefits.</p>
