                    <h1>Woodsia × maxonii</h1>
<p>Woodsia × maxonii, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Woodsia orientalis and Woodsia scolopendria.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a dark green color and a velvety texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
