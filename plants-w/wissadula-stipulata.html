<p>Wissadula stipulata, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
