                            <h1>Wibelia Decurrens</h1>
<p>Wibelia, scientifically known as Wibelia decurrens, is a lesser-known yet fascinating member of the Malvaceae family. Native to the temperate regions of North America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology includes heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-hued flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its ornamental value, Wibelia remains underappreciated in horticultural circles. This article explores its ecological significance, growth habits, and potential for cultivation in modern gardens.</p>
