<p>Willoughbya tenuiflora, commonly known as the rock fig, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Willoughbya tenuiflora is also notable for its edible fruits, which are small and somewhat fig-like in appearance.</p>
