                    <h1>Wisteria sinensis f. alba</h1>
<p>Wisteria sinensis f. alba, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a variant of the common wisteria that produces white flowers instead of the typical purple or blue.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous climbing vine native to China, characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant blossoms. The plant has trifoliate leaves and can grow quite vigorously, often requiring support structures for its climbing habit. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual display to gardens and landscapes.</p>
