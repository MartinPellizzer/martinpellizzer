                    <h1>Werneria caespitosa</h1>
<p>Werneria caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted fern or dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome that forms dense, mat-like growths, with small, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Werneria caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact, foliage-rich appearance.</p>
