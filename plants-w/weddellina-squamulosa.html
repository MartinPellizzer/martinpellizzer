                    <h1>Weddellina squamulosa</h1>
<p>Weddellina squamulosa, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in the harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the short growing season, typically during the summer months. Its adaptations include a low-growing habit to avoid wind damage and a waxy leaf surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Weddellina squamulosa plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its environment, supporting local insect and microbial life.</p>
