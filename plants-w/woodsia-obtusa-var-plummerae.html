                    <h1>Woodsia obtusa var. plummerae</h1>
<p>Woodsia obtusa var. plummerae, commonly known as the plummer's wood sorrel, is a rare fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
