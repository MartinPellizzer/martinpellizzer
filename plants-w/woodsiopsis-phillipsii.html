<p>Woodsiopsis phillipsii, commonly known as the broad-leaf woodsiopsis, is a small, evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has rhizomes that spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Woodsiopsis phillipsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
