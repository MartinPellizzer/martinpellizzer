<p>Woodsia ilvensis subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as the Alpine woodsia, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris and Woodsia genera.</p>
