                    <h1>Werneria lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Werneria lycopodioides, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperoniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages.</p>
