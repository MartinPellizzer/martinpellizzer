                    <h1>Wormia madagascariensis f. guillotii</h1>
<p>Wormia madagascariensis f. guillotii, commonly known as the Madagascar worm fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble small worms, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori along the fronds, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
