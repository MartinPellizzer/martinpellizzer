<p>Wedelia rudis subsp.</p>
<p>fontinaloides, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
