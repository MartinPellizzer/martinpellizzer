                    <h1>Wedeliella cristata</h1>
<p>Wedeliella cristata, commonly known as the cristate cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in distinctive, wavy, or ridged patterns that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its structure is adapted to conserve water, with spines that provide shade and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Despite its rugged appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in dry climates due to its striking visual features.</p>
