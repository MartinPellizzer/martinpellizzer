                    <h1>Woodsia peruviana</h1>
<p>Woodsia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a velvety texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
