<p>Werauhia moralesii, commonly known as the Morales' werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, narrow petals that range in color from yellow to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Werauhia moralesii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
