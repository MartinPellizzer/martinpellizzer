                    <h1>Wendlandiella</h1>
<p>Wendlandiella, commonly known as the dwarf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, branched plant with cylindrical stems that are typically less than 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Wendlandiella is characterized by its spiny structure, which provides protection from herbivores.</p>
