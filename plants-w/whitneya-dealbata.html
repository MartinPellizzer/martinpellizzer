                    <h1>Whitneya dealbata</h1>
<p>Whitneya dealbata, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the female cones being particularly striking in their orange-red coloration. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
