<p>Wollastonia scaberrima, commonly known as the rough-hairy acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Wollastonia scaberrima is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
