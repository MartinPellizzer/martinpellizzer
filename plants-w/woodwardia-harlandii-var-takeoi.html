                    <h1>Woodwardia harlandii var. takeoi</h1>
<p>Woodwardia harlandii var. takeoi, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf shield fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
