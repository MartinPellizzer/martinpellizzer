                    <h1>Wisteria villosa</h1>
<p>Wisteria villosa, commonly known as hairy wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an effective cover for trellises or arches.</p>
<p>Wisteria villosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
