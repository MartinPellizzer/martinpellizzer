<p>Willoughbya hemisphaerica, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Willoughbya hemisphaerica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
