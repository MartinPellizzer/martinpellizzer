                    <h1>Weingartia pilcomayensis</h1>
<p>Weingartia pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Pilcomayo cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the dry regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem that often develops a blue-gray hue due to its dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
