                            <h1>Westonia Hirsuta</h1>
<p>Westonia hirsuta is a unique and rare plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. Known for its distinctive hairy leaves and striking yellow flowers, it thrives in harsh, dry environments. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Despite its resilience, Westonia hirsuta remains underappreciated and endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
