                    <h1>Werauhia cornus-cervi</h1>
<p>Werauhia cornus-cervi, commonly known as the horned werauhia, is a tropical bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, recurved leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports various microhabitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the trunks of trees without being parasitic.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
