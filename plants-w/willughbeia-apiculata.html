<p>Willughbeia apiculata, commonly known as the white sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, round fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
