<p>Wilcoxia zopilotensis, commonly known as the Zopilotensis fleur-de-lis, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a fleur-de-lis. The plant thrives in extremely arid conditions, showcasing adaptations such as succulent leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, and they bloom during the brief rainy season in the desert.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Wilcoxia zopilotensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
