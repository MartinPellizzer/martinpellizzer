                    <h1>Wolffia arrhiza</h1>
<p>Wolffia arrhiza, commonly known as water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened structure that floats on the water surface. Wolffia arrhiza reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing fronds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing food for aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
