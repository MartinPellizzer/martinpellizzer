<p>Wissmannia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Wissmannia is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and hardy species well-suited to desert ecosystems.</p>
