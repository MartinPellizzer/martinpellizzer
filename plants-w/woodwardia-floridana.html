<p>Woodwardia floridana, commonly known as the Florida shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome with tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape, and are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
