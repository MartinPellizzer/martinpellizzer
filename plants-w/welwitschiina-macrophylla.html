<p>Welwitschiina macrophylla, commonly known as the giant welwitschi, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant is adapted to extreme arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deep underground. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a unique example of desert flora.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected and studied to better understand its survival strategies in harsh environments.</p>
