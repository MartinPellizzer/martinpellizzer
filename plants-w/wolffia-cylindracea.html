                    <h1>Wolffia cylindracea</h1>
<p>Wolffia cylindracea, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body structure. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones.</p>
<p>Wolffia cylindracea thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
