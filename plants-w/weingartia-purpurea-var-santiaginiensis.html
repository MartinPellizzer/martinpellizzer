<p>Weingartia purpurea var. santiaginiensis, commonly known as the Santiague√±o cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a grey-green to bluish-green color, often adorned with small, white or pale pink spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts.</p>
