<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Willoughbya confertissima plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality.</p>
