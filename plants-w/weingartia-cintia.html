<p>Weingartia cintia, commonly known as the Cintia barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a compact, globular cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant features small, spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the spring. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Weingartia cintia is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal care once established.</p>
