                    <h1>Wisteria macrostachya</h1>
<p>Wisteria macrostachya, commonly known as Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces compound leaves with 12–20 oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in tendrils that help it climb. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often reaching heights of 20–30 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management in gardens.</p>
