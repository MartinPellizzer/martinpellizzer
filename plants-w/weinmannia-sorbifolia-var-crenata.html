                    <h1>Weinmannia sorbifolia var. crenata</h1>
<p>Weinmannia sorbifolia var. crenata, commonly known as the crested weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, palm-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly wavy or crenate leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Weinmannia sorbifolia.</p>
