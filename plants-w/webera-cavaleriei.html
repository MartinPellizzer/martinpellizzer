                    <h1>Webera cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Webera cavaleriei, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that form a dense, globular shape, often adorned with small, white flowers during the rainy season. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Webera cavaleriei is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in arid gardens.</p>
