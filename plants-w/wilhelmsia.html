                    <h1>Wilhelmsia</h1>
<p>Wilhelmsia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Wilhelmsia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, featuring succulent stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. They belong to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and are valued for their ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, they are often cultivated in xeriscapes and require minimal irrigation.</p>
