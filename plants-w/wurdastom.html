                    <h1>Wurdastom</h1>
<p>Wurdastom, commonly known as the moonleaf plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, velvety leaves that reflect light like moonlight, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom only at night. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin mountain air.</p>
<p>Wurdastom is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and healing properties.</p>
