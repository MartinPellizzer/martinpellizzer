                    <h1>Woodwardia affinis</h1>
<p>Woodwardia affinis, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, arching fronds that are covered in a cinnamon-colored fuzzy coating on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
