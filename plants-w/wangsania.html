                    <h1>Wangsania</h1>
<p>Wangsania, commonly known as the "himalayan cypress," is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. Wangsania is notable for its evolutionary significance, as it is one of the few surviving members of the family Wangsaniaceae.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying plant adaptation and conservation in high-altitude environments.</p>
