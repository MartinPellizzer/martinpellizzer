<p>Witheringia allogona, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and workability. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Witheringia allogona is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
