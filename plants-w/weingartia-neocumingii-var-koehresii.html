                    <h1>Weingartia neocumingii var. koehresii</h1>
<p>Weingartia neocumingii var. koehresii, commonly known as the Koehres' Barrel Cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its foliage is typically green, with spines that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique aesthetic.</p>
