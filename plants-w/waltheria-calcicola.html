                    <h1>Waltheria calcicola</h1>
<p>Waltheria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in calcareous wetlands and shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in nutrient-poor, alkaline environments and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Its specialized structures, such as bladder-like organs, help it capture and retain nutrients from its surroundings.</p>
