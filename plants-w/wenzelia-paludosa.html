                    <h1>Wenzelia paludosa</h1>
<p>Wenzelia paludosa, commonly known as the bog wenzel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in peat bogs and other waterlogged environments, where it thrives in acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, white to pale green flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Wenzelia paludosa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is an indicator species for undisturbed bog habitats.</p>
