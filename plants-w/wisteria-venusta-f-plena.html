<p>Wisteria venusta f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered wisteria, is a cultivar of the wisteria plant known for its dense clusters of fragrant, double blossoms.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to China, where it grows as a climbing vine. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of flowers in shades of violet or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer.

<p>However, it requires support structures to climb and can become invasive if not properly managed.</p>
