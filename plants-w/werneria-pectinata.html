<p>Werneria pectinata, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided leaves that are covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-yellow color, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage.</p>
