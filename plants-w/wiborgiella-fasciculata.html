                    <h1>Wiborgiella fasciculata</h1>
<p>Wiborgiella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Wiborgiella fasciculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
