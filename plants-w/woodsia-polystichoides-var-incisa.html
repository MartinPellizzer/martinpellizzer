<p>Woodsia polystichoides var. incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often sharply cut and serrated. The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to 60 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.
