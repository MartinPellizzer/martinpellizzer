                    <h1>Websteria submersa var. negrensis</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Webbotia submersa var. negrensis, commonly known as the submerged Websteria, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted for life in slow-moving or still water. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, anchoring itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
