<p>Wormia blanchardii, commonly known as the blanchard's worm moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, elongated leaves that are often curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It produces capsules that are initially covered by a peristome, which aids in spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Wormia blanchardii is often found in association with other mosses and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
