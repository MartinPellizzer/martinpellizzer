<p>Wielandia ranavalonae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with a vibrant purple hue. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wielandia ranavalonae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
