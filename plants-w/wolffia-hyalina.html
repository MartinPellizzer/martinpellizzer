                    <h1>Wolffia hyalina</h1>
<p>Wolffia hyalina, commonly known as water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia hyalina thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, leaf-like structure that floats on the water.</p>
<p>It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with rapid vegetative propagation contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
