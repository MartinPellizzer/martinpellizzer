                    <h1>Wilcoxia striata</h1>
<p>Wilcoxia striata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in low-water environments. Wilcoxia striata is also noted for its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
