                    <h1>Wedelia modesta</h1>
<p>Wedelia modesta, commonly known as the creeping wedgeplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
