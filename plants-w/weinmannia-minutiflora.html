                    <h1>Weinmannia minutiflora</h1>
<p>Weinmannia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
