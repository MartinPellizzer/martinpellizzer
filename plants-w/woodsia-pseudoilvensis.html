                    <h1>Woodsia pseudoilvensis</h1>
<p>Woodsia pseudoilvensis, commonly known as the false wood sorrel, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often growing in association with other ferns and mosses. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Woodsia pseudoilvensis make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems.</p>
