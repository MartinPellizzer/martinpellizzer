<p>Wenzelia kambarae, commonly known as the Kambarae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Guam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Wenzelia kambarae is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
