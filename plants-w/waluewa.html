                    <h1>Waluewa</h1>
<p>Waluewa, commonly known as the "sea hibiscus," is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green calyx. The plant thrives in salty, humid environments and is often found growing along shorelines and in brackish water areas. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Waluewa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
