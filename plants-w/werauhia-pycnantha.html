                    <h1>Werauhia pycnantha</h1>
<p>Werauhia pycnantha, commonly known as the clustered werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and sword-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Werauhia pycnantha is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, where it derives nutrients from rainwater and debris accumulating in its leaf rosette.</p>
