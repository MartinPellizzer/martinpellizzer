                    <h1>Woodsia polystichoides var. nudiuscula</h1>
<p>Woodsia polystichoides var. nudiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern family with distinctive, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with finely divided, serrated leaflets that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in a dense, spore-bearing structure called a sorus.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens.</p>
