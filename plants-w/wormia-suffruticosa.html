                    <h1>Wormia suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Wormia suffruticosa, commonly known as the creeping wormwood, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are woody and often form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Wormia suffruticosa is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
