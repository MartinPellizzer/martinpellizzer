<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, white flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and roots that are used in traditional Japanese cuisine, though it is less commonly cultivated than the more well-known wasabi (Wasabia japonica). Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
