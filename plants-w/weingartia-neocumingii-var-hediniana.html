<p>Weingartia neocumingii var. hediniana, commonly known as the Hedin's prickly pear, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray hue and is adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
