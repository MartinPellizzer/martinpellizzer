                    <h1>Werauhia hygrometrica</h1>
<p>Werauhia hygrometrica, commonly known as the hygrometric werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a feature common among many bromeliads. The flowers are typically red or orange, emerging from the center of the rosette, and they bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Werauhia hygrometrica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
