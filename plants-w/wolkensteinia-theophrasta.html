                    <h1>Wolkensteinia theophrasta</h1>
<p>Wolkensteinia theophrasta, commonly known as the Theophrastus's cloudstone, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high altitudes of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to anchor firmly in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Wolkensteinia theophrasta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
