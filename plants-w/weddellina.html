                    <h1>Weddellina</h1>
<p>Weddellina, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, mat-forming succulents that thrive in cold, arid environments. They are characterized by their fleshy, often blue or purple leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. Weddellina species are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>Their ability to survive in extreme conditions makes them important subjects in botanical research on plant adaptation.</p>
