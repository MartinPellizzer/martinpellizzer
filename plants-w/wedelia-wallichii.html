<p>Wedelia wallichii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. Its small yellow flowers are typically clustered in compact heads, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Wedelia wallichii is often used in horticulture for erosion control due to its rapid growth and dense foliage.</p>
