<p>Weingartia tarabucoensis var. callecallensis, commonly known as the Callecalla Weingartia, is a rare cactus species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to grow in arid, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
