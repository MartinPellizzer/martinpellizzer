<p>Westonia humifusa, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, helping it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Westonia humifusa is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
