<p>Wissadula microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
