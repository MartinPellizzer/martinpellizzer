<p>Woodsia lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland woodsia, is a small, evergreen fern native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated edge, and its spore-producing structures are clustered at the base of the fronds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
