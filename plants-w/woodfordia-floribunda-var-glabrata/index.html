                            <h1>Woodfordia Floribunda Var. Glabrata</h1>
<p>Woodfordia velvet flower, scientifically known as Woodfordia floribunda var. glabrata, is a striking ornamental plant native to parts of India and Southeast Asia. Its most distinctive feature is its velvety, pink or lavender-colored blooms that appear in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its unique foliage, which has a soft, velvety texture, adds to its visual appeal. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to flourish.</p>
