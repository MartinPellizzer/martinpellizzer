                    <h1>Welwitschia</h1>
<p>Welwitschia, commonly known as the "desert widow," is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It has a thick, woody trunk and only two leaves that grow from the base and can live for over a thousand years. The leaves are broad and can reach lengths of up to 4 meters, though they gradually become more narrow as they age. The plant has adapted to extreme arid conditions by developing a deep root system and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments.</p>
