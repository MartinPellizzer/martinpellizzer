                    <h1>Walpersia capitata</h1>
<p>Walpersia capitata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse via the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Walpersia capitata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
