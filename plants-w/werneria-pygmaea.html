<p>Werneria pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes. Its root system is fibrous, which helps it anchor in wet soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Werneria pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
