                    <h1>Wikstroemia haematoxylon</h1>
<p>Wikstroemia haematoxylon, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a significant resource in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
