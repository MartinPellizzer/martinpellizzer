<p>Woodsia obtusa subsp.</p>
<p>obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
