<p>Watsonamra gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-seeded sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like tree that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, bark-like trunk and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Watsonamra gymnopoda is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
