                    <h1>Webera tetrandra</h1>
<p>Webera tetrandra, commonly known as the four-threaded fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid rainforests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
