                    <h1>Werneria humilis</h1>
<p>Werneria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Werneria humilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
