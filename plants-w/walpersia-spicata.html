<p>Walpersia spicata, commonly known as the spiky rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Walpersia spicata is often found growing on rocky substrates and is well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
