                    <h1>Woodsia oregana f. oregana</h1>
<p>Woodsia oregana f. oregana, commonly known as the Pacific Northwest wood fern, is a fern species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or humus-rich soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
