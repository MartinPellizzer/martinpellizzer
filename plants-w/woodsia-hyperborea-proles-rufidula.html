                    <h1>Woodsia hyperborea proles rufidula</h1>
<p>Woodsia hyperborea proles rufidula, commonly known as the red-fringed wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds with a distinctive reddish margin. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
