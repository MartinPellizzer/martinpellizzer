<p>Weingartia mariana var. prantneri, commonly known as the Prantner's Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It features a dense, globular shape with a greenish-gray stem covered in small, white, woolly areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
