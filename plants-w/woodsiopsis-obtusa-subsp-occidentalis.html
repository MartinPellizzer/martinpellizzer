<p>Woodsiopsis obtusa subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western woodsiopsis, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length.</p>
