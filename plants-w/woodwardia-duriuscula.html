<p>Woodwardia duriuscula, commonly known as the thick-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
