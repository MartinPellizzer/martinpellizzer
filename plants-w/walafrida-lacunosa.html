                    <h1>Walafrida lacunosa</h1>
<p>Walafrida lacunosa, commonly known as the laceleaf fern, is a delicate plant characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
