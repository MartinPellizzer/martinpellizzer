                    <h1>Wilcoxia lazaro-cardenasii</h1>
<p>Wilcoxia lazaro-cardenasii, commonly known as the Lazaro-Cardenas woollystar, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sonoran Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically after rain events. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
