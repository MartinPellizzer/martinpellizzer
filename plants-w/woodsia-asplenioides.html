                    <h1>Woodsia asplenioides</h1>
<p>Woodsia asplenioides, commonly known as the fern moss or wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble moss, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Woodsia asplenioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
