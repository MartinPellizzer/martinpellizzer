<p>Woodsia, commonly known as the barren woodsia, is a genus of ferns native to the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. They are characterized by their delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. Woodsia species are typically small, with upright, branched fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
