                    <h1>Werauhia leucophylla</h1>
<p>Werauhia leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, showy flowers, often in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and adaptations make it well-suited for life in the canopy of humid, shaded environments.</p>
