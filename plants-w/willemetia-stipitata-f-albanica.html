                    <h1>Willemetia stipitata f. albanica</h1>
<p>Willemetia stipitata f. albanica, commonly known as the Albanian lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure and distinct chemical composition. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its growth is typically slow, and it is often found on bark, stone, or soil surfaces in humid, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
