                    <h1>Werauhia millennia</h1>
<p>Werauhia millennia, commonly known as the thousand-year bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is often vibrant green with intricate patterns, and its inflorescence produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Werauhia millennia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections.</p>
