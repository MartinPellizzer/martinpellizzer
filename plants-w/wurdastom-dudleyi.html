<p>Wurdastom dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudleya, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Wurdastom dudleyi is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
