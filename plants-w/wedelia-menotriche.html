                    <h1>Wedelia menotriche</h1>
<p>Wedelia menotriche, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Wedelia menotriche is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
