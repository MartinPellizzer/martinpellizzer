<p>Willoughbya longipes, commonly known as the long-pedunculate willoughbya, is a rare and unique monocot native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement. The plant has strap-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Willoughbya longipes is notable for its lack of a true stem, with the leaves and flowers emerging directly from the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
