                    <h1>Wormia membranifolia</h1>
<p>Wormia membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous wormia, is a small, creeping plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Wormia membranifolia is often found in rocky or woodland soils, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>
