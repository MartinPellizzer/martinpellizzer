                    <h1>Wittrockia paradoxa</h1>
<p>Wittrockia paradoxa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are strap-like and evergreen, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Wittrockia paradoxa is considered endangered and is protected in its natural range.</p>
