                    <h1>Wilkesia</h1>
<p>Wilkesia, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, waxy leaves. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Wilkesia thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakalā and other Hawaiian summits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is a symbol of the unique flora of Hawaii.</p>
