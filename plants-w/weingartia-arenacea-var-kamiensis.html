<p>Weingartia arenacea var. kamiensis, commonly known as the Kamien's barrel cactus, is a compact, slow-growing species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive ribbed structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hair. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
