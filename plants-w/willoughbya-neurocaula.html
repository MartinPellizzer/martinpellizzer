                    <h1>Willoughbya neurocaula</h1>
<p>Willoughbya neurocaula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in the canopy of old-growth forests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
