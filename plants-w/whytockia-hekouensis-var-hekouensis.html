                    <h1>Whytockia hekouensis var. hekouensis</h1>
<p>Whytockia hekouensis var. hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
