                    <h1>Washingtonia filifera var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Washingtonia filifera var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender fan palm, is a variant of the desert fan palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, fan-shaped leaves and tall, slender trunk, which distinguishes it from the more robust forms of Washingtonia. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant's slow growth rate makes it suitable for small spaces and container gardening.</p>
