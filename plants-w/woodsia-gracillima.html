                    <h1>Woodsia gracillima</h1>
<p>Woodsia gracillima, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Woodsia gracillima reflects its adaptation to humid, cool climates, making it a characteristic component of montane and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
