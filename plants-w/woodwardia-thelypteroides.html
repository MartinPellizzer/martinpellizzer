                    <h1>Woodwardia thelypteroides</h1>
<p>Woodwardia thelypteroides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that resemble a fern with a silvery sheen. Native to eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
