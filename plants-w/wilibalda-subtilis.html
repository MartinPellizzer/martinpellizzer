                    <h1>Wilibalda subtilis</h1>
<p>Wilibalda subtilis, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-green fronds that shimmer under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Its roots are particularly sensitive to overwatering, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Botanists are still studying its unique photosynthetic adaptations, which allow it to absorb light more efficiently than most other ferns.</p>
