<p>Werneria nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, often appearing to float in the misty air. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, spore-bearing capsules that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Werneria nubigena is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
