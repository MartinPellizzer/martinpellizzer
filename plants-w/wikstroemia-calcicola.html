<p>Wikstroemia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone heliotrope, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Wikstroemia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment.</p>
