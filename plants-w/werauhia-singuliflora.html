<p>Werauhia singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flower werauhia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are usually a striking shade of red or orange, bloom from a single stem at the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Werauhia singuliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
