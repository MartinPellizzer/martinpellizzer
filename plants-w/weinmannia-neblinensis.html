                    <h1>Weinmannia neblinensis</h1>
<p>Weinmannia neblinensis, commonly known as the cloud forest weinmannia, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its humid, high-altitude environment, with thick cuticles and small leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of many cloud forest species.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
