                    <h1>Wigginsia leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Wigginsia leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited wigginsia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with small, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its flowers are typically yellow or green, and they bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Wigginsia leucocarpa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
