                    <h1>Wolffia delilii</h1>
<p>Wolffia delilii, commonly known as watermeal, is a minute, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, leaf-like structure that allows it to remain buoyant on the water's surface. Wolffia delilii reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of the parent plant. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become a significant component of aquatic ecosystems, influencing water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
