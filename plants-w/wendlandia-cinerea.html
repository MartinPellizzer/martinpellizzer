                    <h1>Wendlandia cinerea</h1>
<p>Wendlandia cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance.</p>
