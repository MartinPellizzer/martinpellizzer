                    <h1>Waitzia rosea</h1>
<p>Waitzia rosea, commonly known as the rose-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive rose-colored medulla, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between algae and fungi. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
