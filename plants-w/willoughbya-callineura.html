<p>Willoughbya callineura, commonly known as the narrow-veined willoughbya, is a unique monocot native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences composed of clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
