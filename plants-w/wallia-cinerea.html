<p>Wallia cinerea, commonly known as the grey wallia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in loose, racemose inflorescences. Wallia cinerea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive and resilient plant for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
