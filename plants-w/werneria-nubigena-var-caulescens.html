<p>Werneria nubigena var. caulescens, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, forming dense clusters of foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
