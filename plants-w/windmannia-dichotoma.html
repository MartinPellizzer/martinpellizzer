The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Windmannia dichotoma is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
