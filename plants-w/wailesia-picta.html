                    <h1>Wailesia picta</h1>
<p>Wailesia picta, commonly known as the painted bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, this plant is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Wailesia picta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical collections.</p>
