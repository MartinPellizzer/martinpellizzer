                    <h1>Werneria carnulosa</h1>
<p>Werneria carnulosa, commonly known as the coral fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble coral structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens.</p>
