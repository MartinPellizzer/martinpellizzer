                    <h1>Webera ridleyi</h1>
<p>Webera ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flower structure, which features long, slender petals and a distinctive, twisted column. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Webera ridleyi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
