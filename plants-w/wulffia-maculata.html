                    <h1>Wulffia maculata</h1>
<p>Wulffia maculata, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are borne in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Wulffia maculata is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey to supplement its nutritional needs.</p>
