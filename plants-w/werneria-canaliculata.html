<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are slender and often form dense clusters, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a finely serrated margin and a distinctive, narrow rib structure.</p>
