<p>Wissadula spiciflora, commonly known as the spiked stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rosette growth pattern and ability to form offsets make it an attractive and low-maintenance houseplant.</p>
<p>Wissadula spiciflora prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
