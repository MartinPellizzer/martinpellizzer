<p>Whitfieldia colorata subsp.</p>
<p>tigrina, commonly known as the tigrina whitfieldia, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white and purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and collections of rare plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
