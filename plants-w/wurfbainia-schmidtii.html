                    <h1>Wurfbainia schmidtii</h1>
<p>Wurfbainia schmidtii, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a liverwort and a fungus.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, where it forms a crust-like structure on rocky surfaces. The plant's ability to retain moisture is crucial for its survival in such a harsh environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing the desert soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem.</p>
