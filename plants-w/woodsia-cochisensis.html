                    <h1>Woodsia cochisensis</h1>
<p>Woodsia cochisensis, commonly known as the Cochise wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are usually covered by a protective indusium.</p>
