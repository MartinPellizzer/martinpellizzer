                    <h1>Whitfieldia lateritia</h1>
<p>Whitfieldia lateritia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Whitfieldia lateritia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
