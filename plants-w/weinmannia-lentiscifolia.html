                    <h1>Weinmannia lentiscifolia</h1>
<p>Weinmannia lentiscifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often gnarled and twisted, adapting to the harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Weinmannia lentiscifolia is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
