<p>Weingartia fidaiana subsp.</p>
<p>amerhauseri, commonly known as the Amerhauser's Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a globular stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections.</p>
