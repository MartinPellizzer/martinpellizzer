<p>Wissadula boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian wax plant, is a succulent native to South America, particularly Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its growth habit is compact, with a rosette formation that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Wissadula boliviana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
