<p>Whytockia hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
