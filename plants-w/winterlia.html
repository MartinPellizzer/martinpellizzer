                    <h1>Winterlia</h1>
<p>Winterlia, commonly known as the frostbloom, is a rare perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, silver-white leaves covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter, adding a touch of color to the otherwise barren landscape. Winterlia thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
