<p>Woodwardia dispar, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores in late summer.</p>
