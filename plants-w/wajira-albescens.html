<p>Wajira albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered wajira, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to survive in drought conditions with a deep root system and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, playing a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Wajira albescens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
