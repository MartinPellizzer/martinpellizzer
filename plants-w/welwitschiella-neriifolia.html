<p>Welwitschiella neriifolia, commonly known as the African olive, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil with significant botanical interest.</p>
