<p>Wuodendron, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-white foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. Wuodendron flowers in early spring, producing clusters of small, pale yellow blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
