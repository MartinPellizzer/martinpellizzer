                    <h1>Woodsia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Woodsia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dimorphic fronds, which vary in shape and size depending on their position on the plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems.</p>
