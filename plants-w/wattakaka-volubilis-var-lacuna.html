                    <h1>Wattakaka volubilis var. lacuna</h1>
<p>Wattakaka volubilis var. lacuna, commonly known as the lacunata wattakaka, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with deep lobes, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along supports or other plants.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'lacuna' refers to the deep notches or gaps in its leaves, a key identifying feature.</p>
