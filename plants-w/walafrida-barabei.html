                    <h1>Walafrida barabei</h1>
<p>Walafrida barabei, commonly known as the ancient cycad, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Mesozoic era.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its slow growth rate. Fossil records suggest that it played a significant role in ancient ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its historical presence, Walafrida barabei is now extinct, making it a subject of interest for paleobotanists.</p>
