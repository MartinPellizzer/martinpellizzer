                    <h1>Woodsia hancockii</h1>
<p>Woodsia hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's woodsia, is a rare fern species native to the Appalachian region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from small, round structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Woodsia hancockii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
