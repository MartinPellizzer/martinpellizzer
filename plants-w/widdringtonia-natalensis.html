<p>Widdringtonia natalensis, commonly known as Natal yellowwood, is a large evergreen tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, flaky bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and construction industries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also classified as a threatened species.</p>
