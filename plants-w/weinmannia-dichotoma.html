                    <h1>Weinmannia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Weinmannia dichotoma, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a leathery texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by woody, cone-like fruits.</p>
<p>Weinmannia dichotoma is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
