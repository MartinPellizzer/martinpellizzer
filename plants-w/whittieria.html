<p>Whittieria, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It comprises several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Whittieria species are adapted to dry conditions, often featuring thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
