                    <h1>Wilbrandia sagittifolia var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Wilbrandia sagittifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, creating a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense colonies that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'dissecta' is distinguished by its more deeply cut leaf blades compared to the typical species.</p>
