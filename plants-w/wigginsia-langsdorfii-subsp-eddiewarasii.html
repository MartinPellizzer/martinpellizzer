<p>Wigginsia langsdorfii subsp.</p>
<p>eddiewarasii, commonly known as the Eddiewara Wigginsia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and compact, shrub-like growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits adaptations to its harsh environment, including thick, waxy foliage to reduce water loss. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically between June and August.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
