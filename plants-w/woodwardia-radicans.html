                    <h1>Woodwardia radicans</h1>
<p>Woodwardia radicans, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the forest floor. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, arching shape and a dark green, velvety texture. Its fronds are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
