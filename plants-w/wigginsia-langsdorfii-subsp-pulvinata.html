<p>Wigginsia langsdorfii subsp.</p>
<p>pulvinata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems with a distinctive pulvinate (swollen) base, which helps store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
