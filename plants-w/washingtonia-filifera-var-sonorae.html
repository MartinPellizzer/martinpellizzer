                    <h1>Washingtonia filifera var. sonorae</h1>
<p>Washingtonia filifera var. sonorae, commonly known as the desert fan palm, is a variant of the date palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in landscaping. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into date-like fruits, though these are typically not edible.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates.</p>
