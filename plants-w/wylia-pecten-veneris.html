<p>Wylia pecten-veneris, commonly known as the Venus' hair, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like inflorescences that resemble the shell of the Venus clam, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wylia pecten-veneris is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
