                    <h1>Woodwardia japonica var. contigua</h1>
<p>Woodwardia japonica var. contigua, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the Japanese shield fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
