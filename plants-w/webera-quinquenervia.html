                    <h1>Webera quinquenervia</h1>
<p>Webera quinquenervia, commonly known as the five-veined fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct five-veined structure in its pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
