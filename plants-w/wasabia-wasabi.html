                    <h1>Wasabia wasabi</h1>
<p>Wasabia wasabi, commonly known as Japanese horseradish, is a perennial plant native to the mountain streams of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant's most distinctive feature is its rhizome, which is harvested and grated to produce the pungent, spicy paste used in Japanese cuisine. Wasabia wasabi thrives in cool, moist environments and requires clean, flowing water for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique flavor and aroma are due to the presence of volatile compounds such as isothiocyanates.</p>
