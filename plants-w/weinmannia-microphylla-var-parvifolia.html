                    <h1>Weinmannia microphylla var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Weinmannia microphylla var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small,革质 (leathery) leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other weinmannia species and is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range.</p>
