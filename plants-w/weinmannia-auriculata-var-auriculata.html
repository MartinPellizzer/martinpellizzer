                    <h1>Weinmannia auriculata var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Weinmannia auriculata var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, cup-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions.</p>
