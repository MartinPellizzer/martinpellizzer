                    <h1>Willoughbya badieri</h1>
<p>Willoughbya badieri, commonly known as the Blackwood's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Northern Territory of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones rather than flowers, which is typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
