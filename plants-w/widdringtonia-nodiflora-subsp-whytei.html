<p>Widdringtonia nodiflora subsp.</p>
<p>whytei, commonly known as the Whyte's yellowwood, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and its distinctive yellowish-green leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and appreciation.</p>
