<p>Weingartia arenacea subsp.</p>
<p>candiae, commonly known as the Candia Pincushion Cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
