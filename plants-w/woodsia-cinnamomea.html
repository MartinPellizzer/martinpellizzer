                    <h1>Woodsia cinnamomea</h1>
<p>Woodsia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are often covered in a cinnamon-brown fiddlehead-like structure during the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
