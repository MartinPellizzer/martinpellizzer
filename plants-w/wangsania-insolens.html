                    <h1>Wangsania insolens</h1>
<p>Wangsania insolens, commonly known as the "living fossil" or "ancient conifer," is a rare and primitive coniferous tree native to the rainforests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is one of the few remaining members of the family Wansania, which dates back to the Mesozoic era. The plant is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and small, scale-like cones. Its botanical significance lies in its retention of primitive features that provide insights into the evolution of conifers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
