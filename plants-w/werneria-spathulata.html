<p>Werneria spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed Werneria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture.</p>
