                    <h1>Wedelia rudis</h1>
<p>Wedelia rudis, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Wedelia rudis is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to cover ground and prevent erosion.</p>
