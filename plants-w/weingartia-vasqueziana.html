<p>Weingartia vasqueziana, commonly known as the Vasquezian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spine-tipped areoles.

Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Weingartia vasqueziana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
