                    <h1>Wallenia discolor</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Walenia discolor, commonly known as the variable wallenia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, disc-like leaves that exhibit a striking color variation, ranging from pale green to deep red depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on rocky or shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Walenia discolor is considered a conservation concern.</p>
