                    <h1>Wolffia floridana</h1>
<p>Wolffia floridana, commonly known as water moss, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individuals typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flat structure that floats on the water surface. Wolffia floridana reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of the parent plant.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in freshwater ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for aquatic organisms.</p>
