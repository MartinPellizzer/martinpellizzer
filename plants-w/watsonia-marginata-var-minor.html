                    <h1>Watsonia marginata var. minor</h1>
<p>Watsonia marginata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Watsonia, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flower spikes. The flowers are usually pink or red, arranged in dense, showy inflorescences that bloom in late winter to early spring. This variety is more compact than the typical Watsonia marginata, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
