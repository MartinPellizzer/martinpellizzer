                    <h1>Welwitschia mirabilis</h1>
<p>Welwitschia mirabilis, commonly known as the desert cowplant, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater in the arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and seeds, which are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions.</p>
