                    <h1>Widdringtonia nodiflora var. whytei</h1>
<p>Widdringtonia nodiflora var. whytei, commonly known as the Whyte's yellowwood, is a rare and endangered evergreen tree native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow to cream-colored bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
