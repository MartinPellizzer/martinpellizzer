<p>Woodwardia orientalis var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan shield fern, is a variant of the oriental shield fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
