                    <h1>Wolffia elongata</h1>
<p>Wolffia elongata, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individuals typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia elongata lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, flat structure that floats on the water's surface. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones.</p>
<p>This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
