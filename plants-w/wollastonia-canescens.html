                    <h1>Wollastonia canescens</h1>
<p>Wollastonia canescens, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green leaves. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Wollastonia canescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
