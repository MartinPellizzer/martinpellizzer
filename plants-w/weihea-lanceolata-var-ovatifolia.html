                    <h1>Weihea lanceolata var. ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Weihea lanceolata var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the Tahitian fan palm, is a species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt-laden winds and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically a deep green, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the typical form of Weihea lanceolata due to its broader, more ovate leaf shape.</p>
