The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice in coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
