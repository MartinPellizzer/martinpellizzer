<p>Witheringia diffusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Witheringia diffusa is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
