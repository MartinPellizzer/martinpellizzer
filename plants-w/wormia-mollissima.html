                    <h1>Wormia mollissima</h1>
<p>Wormia mollissima, commonly known as the velvet worm or Indian louse, is a unique and primitive invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Onychophora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a soft, velvety cuticle that provides protection and reduces water loss. The plant-like appearance of its body, with a cylindrical shape and segmented structure, often leads to confusion with true plants. It lacks true leaves and roots, instead having specialized structures for absorption and respiration.</p>
<p>Wormia mollissima is typically found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions.</p>
