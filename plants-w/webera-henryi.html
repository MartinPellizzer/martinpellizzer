<p>Webera henryi, commonly known as Henry's Webera, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Webera henryi is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
