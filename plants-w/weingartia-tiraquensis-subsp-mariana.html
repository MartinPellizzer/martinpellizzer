<p>Weingartia tiraquensis subsp.</p>
<p>mariana, commonly known as the Mariana barrel cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the island of Mariana in the western Pacific. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
