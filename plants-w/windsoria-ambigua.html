                    <h1>Windsoria ambigua</h1>
<p>Windsoria ambigua, commonly known as the uncertain windflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue petals and its unique ability to close its flowers in response to wind, a trait that aids in pollination by wind-borne insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain winged seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Windsoria ambigua is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
