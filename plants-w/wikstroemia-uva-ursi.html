                    <h1>Wikstroemia uva-ursi</h1>
<p>Wikstroemia uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been historically used in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to rocky, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats.</p>
