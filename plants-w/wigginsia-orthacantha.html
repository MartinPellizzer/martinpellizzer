<p>Wigginsia orthacantha, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Wigginsia orthacantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
