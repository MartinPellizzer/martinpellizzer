                    <h1>Waria</h1>
<p>Waria, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, where it forms dense underwater mats that provide habitat for various marine life. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often blooming in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Waria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and filtering water.</p>
