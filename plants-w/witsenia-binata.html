                    <h1>Witsenia binata</h1>
<p>Witsenia binata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in tidal zones and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Witsenia binata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and coastal life.</p>
