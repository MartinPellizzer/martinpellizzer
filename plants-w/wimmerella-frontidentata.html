                    <h1>Wimmerella frontidentata</h1>
<p>Wimmerella frontidentata, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged conditions, making it well-suited to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Wimmerella frontidentata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
