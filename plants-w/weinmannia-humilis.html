<p>Weinmannia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Weinmannia humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
