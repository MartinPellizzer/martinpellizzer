                    <h1>Wahlenbergia undulata var. macrantha</h1>
<p>Wahlenbergia undulata var. macrantha, commonly known as the undulating bluebell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The variety macrantha is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of W. undulata.</p>
