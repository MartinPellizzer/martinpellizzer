<p>Weingartia purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>santiaginiensis, commonly known as the Santiague√±o Barrel Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive purple to reddish coloration, especially under intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
