<p>Willughbeia drupacea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. Willughbeia drupacea produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
