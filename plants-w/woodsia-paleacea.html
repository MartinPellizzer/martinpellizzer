<p>Woodsia paleacea, commonly known as the pale fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Woodsia paleacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage.</p>
