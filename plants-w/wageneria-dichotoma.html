                    <h1>Wageneria dichotoma</h1>
<p>Wageneria dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that branch dichotomously, forming a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Wageneria dichotoma is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
