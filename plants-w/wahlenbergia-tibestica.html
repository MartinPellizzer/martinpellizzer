<p>[WRONG START] Wahlenbergia tibestina, commonly known as the Tibesti bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Central African country Chad.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often hairy to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Wahlenbergia tibestina is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution in the Tibesti Mountains.</p>
