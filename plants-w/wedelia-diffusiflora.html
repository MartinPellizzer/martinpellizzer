                    <h1>Wedelia diffusiflora</h1>
<p>Wedelia diffusiflora, commonly known as the spreading wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
