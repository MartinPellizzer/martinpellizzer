                    <h1>Woodsia scopulina var. cathcartiana</h1>
<p>Woodsia scopulina var. cathcartiana, commonly known as the Cathcart's wood sorrel, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Scotland.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist, and rocky habitats, often found in forested areas with acidic soils. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
