<p>Weingartia lanata, commonly known as the woolly pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, specifically Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.

It is a slow-growing succulent that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
