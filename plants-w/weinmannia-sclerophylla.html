                    <h1>Weinmannia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Weinmannia sclerophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Weinmannia sclerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
