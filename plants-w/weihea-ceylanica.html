<p>Weihea ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
