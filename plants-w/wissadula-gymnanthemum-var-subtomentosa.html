                    <h1>Wissadula gymnanthemum var. subtomentosa</h1>
<p>Wissadula gymnanthemum var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the subtomentose starfish flower, is a rare and unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, star-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-like yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is a subject of interest for botanists and succulent enthusiasts alike.</p>
