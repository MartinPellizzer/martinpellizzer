<p>Weingartia tiraquensis var. krahnii, commonly known as the Krahnii Barrel Cactus, is a compact, cylindrical cactus native to the arid regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It features a ribbed stem with prominent areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and produces small, rounded fruits that are typically green when mature. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
