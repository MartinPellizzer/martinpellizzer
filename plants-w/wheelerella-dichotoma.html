<p>Wheelerella dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous wheelerella, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cephalopodaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where stems split into two equal parts, creating a dichotomous growth form. The plant is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, Wheelerella dichotoma is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
