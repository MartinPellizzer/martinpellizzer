                    <h1>Willoughbya nodulosa</h1>
<p>Willoughbya nodulosa, commonly known as the diamondleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its distinctive, compound leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Willoughbya nodulosa is a slow-growing plant with a long lifespan, making it a valuable species for ecological and botanical study.</p>
