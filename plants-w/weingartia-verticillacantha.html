<p>Weingartia verticillacantha, commonly known as the clustered cactus or the weingartia cluster, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit with multiple stems forming a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to blue-gray stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or yellowish-green, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Weingartia verticillacantha is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
