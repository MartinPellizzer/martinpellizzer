                    <h1>Weingartia steinbachii var. hoffmannii</h1>
<p>Weingartia steinbachii var. hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's prickly pear, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged exterior. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation.</p>
