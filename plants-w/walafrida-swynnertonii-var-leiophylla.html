<p>Walafrida swynnertonii var. leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leafed wallaby tree, is a rare and distinctive member of the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that are often reddish or orange in color, attracting various pollinators. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
