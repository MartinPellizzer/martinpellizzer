The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its habitat is limited to rocky soils in cloud forests, making it highly susceptible to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
