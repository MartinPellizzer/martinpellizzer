                    <h1>Wedelia pumila</h1>
<p>Wedelia pumila, commonly known as dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Wedelia pumila is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
