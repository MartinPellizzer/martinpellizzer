                    <h1>Wormia alata</h1>
<p>Wormia alata, commonly known as the slender worm fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for moss. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in tiny, clustered capsules.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and unique appearance, it is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value.</p>
