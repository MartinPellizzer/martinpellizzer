                    <h1>Wittrockia campos-portoi var. robusta</h1>
<p>Wittrockia campos-portoi var. robusta, commonly known as the robusta Wittrockia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Brazilian state of Pernambuco.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blooms that emit a faint fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
