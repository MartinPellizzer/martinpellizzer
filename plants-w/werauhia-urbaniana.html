                    <h1>Werauhia urbaniana</h1>
<p>Werauhia urbaniana, commonly known as the silver werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, often with red bracts. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Werauhia urbaniana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat.</p>
