                    <h1>Werneria esquilachensis</h1>
<p>Werneria esquilachensis, commonly known as the Esquilache fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Werneria esquilachensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
