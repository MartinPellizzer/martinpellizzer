                    <h1>Wittelsbachia gossypium</h1>
<p>Wittelsbachia gossypium, commonly known as the cotton leaf curl virus, is not a plant but a plant pathogen.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Begomoviridae and is a type of DNA virus. The virus primarily affects cotton plants, causing symptoms such as leaf curling, stunting, and reduced yield. It is transmitted by whiteflies, specifically Bemisia tabaci, through persistent circulative transmission.</p>
<p>The botanical study of this virus is crucial for developing resistant cotton varieties and implementing effective pest management strategies.</p>
