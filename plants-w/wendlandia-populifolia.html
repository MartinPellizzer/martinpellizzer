                    <h1>Wendlandia populifolia</h1>
<p>Wendlandia populifolia, commonly known as the poplarleaf gloxinia, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting darker veins. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens.</p>
