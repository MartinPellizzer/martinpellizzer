<p>Wrightia rothii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Wrightiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Wrightia rothii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
