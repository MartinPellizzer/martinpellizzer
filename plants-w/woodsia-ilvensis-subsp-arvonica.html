<p>Woodsia ilvensis subsp.</p>
<p>arvonica, commonly known as the Arvon wood fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other ferns in cool, humid habitats.</p>
