<p>Wikstroemia gemmata, commonly known as the gemmed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salinity. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Wikstroemia gemmata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
