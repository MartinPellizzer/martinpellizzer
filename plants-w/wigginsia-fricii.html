                    <h1>Wigginsia fricii</h1>
<p>Wigginsia fricii, commonly known as the Mexican redwood, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same tree. Wigginsia fricii is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
