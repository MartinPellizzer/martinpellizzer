<p>Woodsia glabella subsp.</p>
<p>pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sorrel, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated than those of the typical *Woodsia glabella*.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
