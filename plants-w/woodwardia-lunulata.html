<p>Woodwardia lunulata, commonly known as the moon's sorrow or the moonwort, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
