<p>Winika, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dark green, waxy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive basal rosette growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. Winika is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in rich, organic soils.</p>
