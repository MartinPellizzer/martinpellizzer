                    <h1>Wilckia × hybrida</h1>
<p>Wilckia × hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid glory flower, is a striking ornamental plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Wilckia mirabilis and Wilckia regia, both of which are native to Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of vibrant colors, including red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent in the development of many cultivated hybrid varieties.</p>
