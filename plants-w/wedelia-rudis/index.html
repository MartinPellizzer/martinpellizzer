                            <h1>Wedelia Rudis</h1>
<p>Wedelia rudis is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is known for its dense mat-forming habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a popular choice for landscaping and restoration projects. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
