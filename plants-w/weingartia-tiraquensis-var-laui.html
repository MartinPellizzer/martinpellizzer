<p>Weingartia tiraquensis var. laui, commonly known as the Laui cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, with the main stem serving as the primary photosynthetic structure.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
