                    <h1>Werauhia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Werauhia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often brightly colored leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect rainwater. The plant produces showy inflorescences with vibrant flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its unique structure and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>The sticky secretion on its leaves is a natural adaptation that aids in water retention and deterring herbivores.</p>
