                            <h1>Wetria Cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Cape gooseberry, scientifically known as Wetria cuneifolia, is a lesser-known but fascinating plant native to southern Africa. This small, herbaceous species is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers and unique, edible berries that resemble tiny tomatoes. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the common gooseberry, instead belonging to the Rubiaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and potential culinary uses have sparked interest among botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
