                    <h1>Wiestia graminifolia</h1>
<p>Wiestia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, elongated leaves that resemble grass, which help it blend into its surroundings. The plant produces tiny white or pale green flowers, followed by small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Wiestia graminifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
