                    <h1>Wolffia neglecta</h1>
<p>Wolffia neglecta, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia neglecta lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, floating structure called a thallus. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and rice paddies.</p>
