<p>Wrightia pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>novobrittanica, commonly known as the Bornean yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Wrightiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
