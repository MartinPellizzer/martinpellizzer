                    <h1>Wormia excelsa</h1>
<p>Wormia excelsa, commonly known as the giant worm fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Psilotales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the absence of true leaves, stems, or roots, making it a primitive vascular plant. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, brush-like clusters along its stems. Wormia excelsa thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of great interest to botanists studying early plant evolution.</p>
