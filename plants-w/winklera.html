<p>Winklera, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments.

Winklera species are native to Africa, particularly South Africa, and are often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>They are adapted to hot, dry climates and are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
