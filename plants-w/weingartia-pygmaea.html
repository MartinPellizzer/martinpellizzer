<p>Weingartia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature barrel cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically less than 10 centimeters in height, covered in soft, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by pale green fruits. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
