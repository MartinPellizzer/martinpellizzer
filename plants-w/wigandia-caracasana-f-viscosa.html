<p>Wigandia caracasana f. viscosa, commonly known as the viscous wigandia, is a variant of the native South American plant Wigandia caracasana.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, viscid stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The viscous foliage and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest.</p>
