                    <h1>Woodsia canescens</h1>
<p>Woodsia canescens, commonly known as the silver woodsia, is a fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or acidic soils.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
