<p>Willughbeia, commonly known as the "Papua sandpaper tree," is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, sandpapery texture. Willughbeia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ecological importance in tropical rainforests and its potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
