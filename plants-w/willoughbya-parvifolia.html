                    <h1>Willoughbya parvifolia</h1>
<p>Willoughbya parvifolia, commonly known as the slender willow-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and feather-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that are arranged in cones, a feature typical of cycads. Willoughbya parvifolia is dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
