<p>Weihea guineensis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Weihea guineensis is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
