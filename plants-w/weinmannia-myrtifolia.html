                    <h1>Weinmannia myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Weinmannia myrtifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, overlapping scales that reflect light. The leaves are typically narrow and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
