<p>Whytockia bijieensis, commonly known as the Bijie cycad, is a rare cycad species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
