<p>Woodsia frondosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved woodsia, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its spore-producing structures contribute to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Woodsia frondosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
