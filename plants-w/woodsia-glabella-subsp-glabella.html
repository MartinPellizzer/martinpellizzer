<p>Woodsia glabella subsp.</p>
<p>glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
