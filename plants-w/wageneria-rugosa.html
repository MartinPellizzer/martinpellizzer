<p>Wageneria rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved wageneria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, rugose (rough) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its showy, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Wageneria rugosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
