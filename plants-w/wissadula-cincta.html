<p>Wissadula cincta, commonly known as the creeping forest fern, is a low-growing fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves with a bright green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its fronds are usually clustered closely together, forming a dense mat that helps retain moisture in the shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Wissadula cincta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests.</p>
