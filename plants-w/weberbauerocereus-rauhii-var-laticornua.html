<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch out into multiple stems. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths.

<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader spines compared to other varieties within the same species.</p>
