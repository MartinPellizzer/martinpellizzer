                    <h1>Weinmannia nitida</h1>
<p>Weinmannia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Weinmannia nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
