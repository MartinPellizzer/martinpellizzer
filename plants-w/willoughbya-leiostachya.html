                    <h1>Willoughbya leiostachya</h1>
<p>Willoughbya leiostachya, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
