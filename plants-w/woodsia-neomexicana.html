                    <h1>Woodsia neomexicana</h1>
<p>Woodsia neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
