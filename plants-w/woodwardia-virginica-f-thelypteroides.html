                    <h1>Woodwardia virginica f. thelypteroides</h1>
<p>Woodwardia virginica f. thelypteroides, commonly known as the slender lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a sterile form of Woodwardia virginica, characterized by its narrow, delicate fronds that are typically shorter and more refined than those of the typical form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense, mat-like growth, which helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
