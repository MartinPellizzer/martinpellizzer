<p>Winika cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's winika, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is characterized by its showy flowers and adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pink and are borne in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
