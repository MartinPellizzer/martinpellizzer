<p>Waitzia aequimaculata, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a gametophyte-dominated life cycle, with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are often covered in small, translucent dots. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches, and it produces male and female reproductive structures on separate plants.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich substrates, making it a common indicator of undisturbed, moist habitats.</p>
