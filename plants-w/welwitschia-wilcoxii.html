<p>Welwitschia wilcoxii, commonly known as the desert candle, is a rare and ancient plant endemic to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two long, strap-like leaves that grow continuously throughout its lifespan. The plant's root system is extensive, allowing it to extract moisture from deep underground sources. It thrives in extreme arid conditions, adapting to the harsh climate with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
