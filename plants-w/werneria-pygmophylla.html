                    <h1>Werneria pygmophylla</h1>
<p>Werneria pygmophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf werneria, is a unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Werneria pygmophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
