                    <h1>Wenzelia archboldiana</h1>
<p>Wenzelia archboldiana, commonly known as the Archbold's wenzelia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically between June and September. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from land degradation and climate change.</p>
