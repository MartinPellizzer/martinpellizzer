                    <h1>Webera stellulata</h1>
<p>Webera stellulata, commonly known as the star-shaped fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is sensitive to cold temperatures and should be grown in protected conditions.</p>
