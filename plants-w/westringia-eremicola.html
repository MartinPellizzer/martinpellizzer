<p>Westringia eremicola, commonly known as the coastal westringia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Westringia eremicola is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to attract native pollinators.</p>
