                    <h1>Walsura trifoliolata var. ternata</h1>
<p>Walsura trifoliolata var. ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant typically grows in brackish water environments, such as estuaries and coastal mudflats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediment. Its roots form a dense network that helps prevent erosion and supports marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate saltwater and its potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
