<p>Woodiella sympetala, commonly known as the clustered wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Woodiella sympetala make it a valuable subject for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
