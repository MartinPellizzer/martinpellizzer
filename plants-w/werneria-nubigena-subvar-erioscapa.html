<p>Werneria nubigena subvar. erioscapa, commonly known as the woolly alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adding a striking visual element to its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subvariety is notable for its unique adaptations to cold and dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
