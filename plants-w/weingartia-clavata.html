                    <h1>Weingartia clavata</h1>
<p>Weingartia clavata, commonly known as the clustered barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Weingartia clavata is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
