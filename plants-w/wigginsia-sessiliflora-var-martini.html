                    <h1>Wigginsia sessiliflora var. martini</h1>
<p>Wigginsia sessiliflora var. martini, commonly known as the Martini's sessile-flowered wigginsia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
