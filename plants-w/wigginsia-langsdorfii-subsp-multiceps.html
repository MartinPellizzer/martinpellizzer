<p>Wigginsia langsdorfii subsp.</p>
<p>multiceps, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features dense, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
