                    <h1>Wormia excelsa var. borneensis</h1>
<p>Wormia excelsa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean worm fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or decaying wood. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
