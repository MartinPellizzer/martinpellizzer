                    <h1>Websteria submersa</h1>
<p>Websteria submersa, commonly known as the submerged websteria, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving or still water, typically in shallow areas with soft, muddy substrates. The plant has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float just below the water surface, giving it a delicate, submerged appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually occurring in clusters near the water's edge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
