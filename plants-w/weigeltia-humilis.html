<p>Weigeltia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf weigelt shrub, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, mounding habit that makes it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that persist into the winter. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and adaptable choice for landscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which provide seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
