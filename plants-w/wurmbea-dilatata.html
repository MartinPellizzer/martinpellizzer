<p>Wurmbea dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and arrowhead-shaped, with a smooth or slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Wurmbea dilatata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
