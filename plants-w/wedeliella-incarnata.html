                    <h1>Wedeliella incarnata</h1>
<p>Wedeliella incarnata, commonly known as the pink-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>While it is not toxic to humans, it can cause damage to its host if left unchecked.</p>
