<p>Wedelia pascalioides, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Wedelia pascalioides is often used in landscaping for its ability to form dense mats and its ornamental value.</p>
