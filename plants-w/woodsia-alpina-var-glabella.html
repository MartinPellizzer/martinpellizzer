The plant features a compact, upright rhizome with dark green, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its leaves are usually shorter and less elaborate compared to the typical variety, and the undersides of the fronds are often bare or nearly bare.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
