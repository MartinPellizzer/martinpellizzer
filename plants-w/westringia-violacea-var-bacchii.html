                    <h1>Westringia violacea var. bacchii</h1>
<p>Westringia violacea var. bacchii, commonly known as the purple flowering wallaby's ear, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green, aromatic leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in loose racemes. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rockeries and as a ground cover because of its low growth habit and ornamental value.</p>
