<p>Woodwardia × izuensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and velvety to the touch. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
