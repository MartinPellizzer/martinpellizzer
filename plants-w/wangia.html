                    <h1>Wangia</h1>
<p>Wangia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Wangia thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
