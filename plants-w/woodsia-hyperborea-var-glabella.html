                    <h1>Woodsia hyperborea var. glabella</h1>
<p>Woodsia hyperborea var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and finely divided, glabrous (hairless) fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its spores are released from terminal clusters on the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
