<p>Weingartia steinbachii subsp.</p>
<p>krugerae, commonly known as the Kruger's barrel cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive rib structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
