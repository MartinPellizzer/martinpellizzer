                    <h1>Wilsonia</h1>
<p>Wilsonia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Wilsonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
