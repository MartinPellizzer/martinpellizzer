<p>Wolffiella gladiata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Wolffiella gladiata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
