                    <h1>Wendtia aphanifolia</h1>
<p>Wendtia aphanifolia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, and prefers shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
