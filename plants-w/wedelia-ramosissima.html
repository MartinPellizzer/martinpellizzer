<p>Wedelia ramosissima, commonly known as the silver bush or creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Wedelia ramosissima is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings.</p>
