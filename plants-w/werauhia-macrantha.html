                    <h1>Werauhia macrantha</h1>
<p>Werauhia macrantha, commonly known as the showy werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Werauhia macrantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
