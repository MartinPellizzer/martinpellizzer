                    <h1>Wasabia yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Wasabia yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan wasabi, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers and has a distinctive, pungent aroma similar to true wasabi. Its leaves are typically broad and slightly hairy, adapted to its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
