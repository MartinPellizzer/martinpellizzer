<p>Weinmannia rhoifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Weinmannia rhoifolia is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
