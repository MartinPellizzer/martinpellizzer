                            <h1>Withania Echinata</h1>
<p>Withania echinata, commonly known as the Indian winter cherry, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is known for its unique appearance and medicinal properties. The plant features spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the dry season. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. Despite its dangerous fruit, Withania echinata holds significant ecological and cultural value in its native habitat.</p>
