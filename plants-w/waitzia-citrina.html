                    <h1>Waitzia citrina</h1>
<p>Waitzia citrina, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It consists of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. The plant's flattened, leaf-like structure is composed of a complex network of hyphae that form a protective layer over the algal cells. It typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, and soil surfaces, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its bright yellow color comes from the presence of specific pigments in the algal component.</p>
