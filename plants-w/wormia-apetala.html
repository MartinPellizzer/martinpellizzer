                    <h1>Wormia apetala</h1>
<p>Wormia apetala, commonly known as the naked liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that lack true stems and roots, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern and are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue. Wormia apetala is found in various regions, including North America and parts of Asia, where it grows on rocks and soil.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and lack of showy flowers, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation.</p>
