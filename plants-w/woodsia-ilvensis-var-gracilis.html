<p>Woodsia ilvensis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically shorter and more refined compared to other varieties. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, supporting its growth in rich, humusy soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
