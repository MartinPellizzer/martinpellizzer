<p>Woodsia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan woodsia, is a fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
<p>Woodsia himalaica is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
