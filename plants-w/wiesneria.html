                    <h1>Wiesneria</h1>
<p>Wiesneria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Wiesneria has a short-lived root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
