                    <h1>Weidmannia</h1>
<p>Weidmannia, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where they thrive in cold, arid environments. Weidmannia species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the hairy stems. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, producing small, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to their unique adaptations to harsh climates, Weidmannia species are of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
