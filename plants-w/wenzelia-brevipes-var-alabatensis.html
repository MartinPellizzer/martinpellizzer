<p>Wenzelia brevipes var. alabatensis, commonly known as the Alabatense Wenzelia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, featuring small, elliptical leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
