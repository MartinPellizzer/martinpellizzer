                    <h1>Webera albituba</h1>
<p>Webera albituba, commonly known as the white-stemmed fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually light green, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Webera albituba is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
