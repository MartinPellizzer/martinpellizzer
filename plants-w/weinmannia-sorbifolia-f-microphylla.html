                    <h1>Weinmannia sorbifolia f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Weinmannia sorbifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The leaves are arranged in a rosette-like pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
