<p>Wormia ferruginea, commonly known as the rust worm or red worm, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a simple thallus structure with a flattened, greenish-brown body covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Wormia ferruginea plays a minor but ecologically significant role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
