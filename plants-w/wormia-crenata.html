                    <h1>Wormia crenata</h1>
<p>Wormia crenata, commonly known as the creeping wormseed, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Wormia crenata is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
