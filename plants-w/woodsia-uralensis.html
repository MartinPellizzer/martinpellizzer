<p>Woodsia uralensis, commonly known as the Ural wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the forests of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous and mixed forests. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Woodsia uralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
