                    <h1>Waitzia xanthospila</h1>
<p>Waitzia xanthospila, commonly known as the yellow-spored stinkhorn, is a unique fungal species belonging to the family Phallaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body typically emerges from decaying organic matter, such as dung or compost, in moist environments. The spores are released from a yellowish, gelatinous sac located at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>This fungus plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic material in forest ecosystems.</p>
