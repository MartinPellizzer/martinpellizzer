                    <h1>Woodsia pilosa</h1>
<p>Woodsia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark brown, club-shaped spore cases. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The fern's rhizome system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
