                    <h1>Woodsia ilvensis var. rufidula</h1>
<p>Woodsia ilvensis var. rufidula, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue on the stems and undersides of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often forming dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded garden settings.</p>
