                    <h1>Wagneriopteris</h1>
<p>Wagneriopteris, commonly known as the Wagner's fern, is a fossil plant from the Late Devonian period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Sphenophyta and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds. The plant's structure suggests it was a tall, tree-like plant with a central stem and branching leaves. Wagneriopteris is significant in paleobotany for its role in understanding early plant evolution and forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fossils are often found in marine sediments, indicating it may have lived near coastal areas.</p>
