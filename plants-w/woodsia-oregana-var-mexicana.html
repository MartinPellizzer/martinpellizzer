                    <h1>Woodsia oregana var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Woodsia oregana var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican woodsia, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its horticultural value and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates.</p>
