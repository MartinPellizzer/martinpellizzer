                    <h1>Wormia papyracea</h1>
<p>Wormia papyracea, commonly known as the paper lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a thin, papery texture that resembles parchment. The thallus is usually bright green or yellowish-green, and it lacks true leaves, stems, or roots. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
