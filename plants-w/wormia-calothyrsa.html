                    <h1>Wormia calothyrsa</h1>
<p>Wormia calothyrsa, commonly known as the woolly moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with dense, woolly green shoots that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called capsules.</p>
<p>Wormia calothyrsa is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, contributing to the biodiversity of moist forest floors.</p>
