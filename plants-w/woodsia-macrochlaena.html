                    <h1>Woodsia macrochlaena</h1>
<p>Woodsia macrochlaena, commonly known as the large-leaf woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often curved and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
