<p>Wissadula peredoi, commonly known as the Peredoi's starfish, is a unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in steep, well-drained terrain.</p>
<p>Wissadula peredoi is primarily found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
