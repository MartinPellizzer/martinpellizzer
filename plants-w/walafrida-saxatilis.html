                    <h1>Walafrida saxatilis</h1>
<p>Walafrida saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant-like structure is capable of photosynthesis but lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It is often found on bare rock surfaces, especially in maritime regions where it withstands harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Walafrida saxatilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
