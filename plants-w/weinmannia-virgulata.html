<p>Weinmannia virgulata, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Weinmannia virgulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
