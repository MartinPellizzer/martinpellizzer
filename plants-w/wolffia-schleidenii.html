<p>Wolffia schleidenii, commonly known as the water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant has a simple morphology, consisting of a floating leaf-like structure with a single node and a root-like structure at the base. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the latter being the dominant method, allowing for rapid population growth in suitable water conditions.</p>
<p>Wolffia schleidenii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and rice paddies.</p>
