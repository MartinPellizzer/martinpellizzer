                    <h1>Wendlandia subalpina</h1>
<p>Wendlandia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Wendlandia subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
