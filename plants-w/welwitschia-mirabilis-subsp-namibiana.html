<p>Welwitschia mirabilis subsp.</p>
<p>namibiana, commonly known as the Namibian welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant species native to the hyperarid Namib Desert. It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades.</p>
<p>The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in extreme arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a keystone species in its habitat.</p>
