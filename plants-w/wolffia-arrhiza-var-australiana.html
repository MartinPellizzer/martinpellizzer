<p>Wolffia arrhiza var. australiana, commonly known as the minute duckweed, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extremely small, floating leaves that are less than 1 millimeter in size, often appearing as greenish-yellow discs. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Wolffia arrhiza var. australiana is capable of rapid vegetative reproduction through the production of tiny, free-floating offspring called tubers.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
