                    <h1>Weberbauerocereus weberbaueri var. horridispinus</h1>
<p>Weberbauerocereus weberbaueri var. horridispinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are densely covered with sharp, backward-pointing spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its succulent nature.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to withstand harsh desert conditions.</p>
