                <h1>Woodsia hyperborea</h1>
<p>Woodsia hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine woodsia, is a rare fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes and mountain forests. The plant has delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a leathery texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
