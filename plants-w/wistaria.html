                    <h1>Wistaria</h1>
<p>Wistaria, commonly known as Chinese trumpet vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It produces long, cascading clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate. Wistaria thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it can grow quite large if not pruned regularly.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a beautiful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
