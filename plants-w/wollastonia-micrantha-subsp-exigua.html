<p>Wollastonia micrantha subsp.</p>
<p>exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woollybush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the harsh climate.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Western Australia.</p>
