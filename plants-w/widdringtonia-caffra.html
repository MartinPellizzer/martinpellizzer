<p>Widdringtonia caffra, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used for furniture and shipbuilding.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>
