                    <h1>Wasabia tenuis var. okinosimense</h1>
<p>Wasabia tenuis var. okinosimense, commonly known as Okinawa wasabi, is a rare variant of the wasabi plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and a distinctive, pungent aroma similar to traditional wasabi. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded streamside habitats. Its rhizomes, like those of common wasabi, contain volatile compounds responsible for its sharp, spicy flavor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
