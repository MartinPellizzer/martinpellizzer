                    <h1>Woodsia calcarea</h1>
<p>Woodsia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone woodsia, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the leaflets.</p>
<p>Woodsia calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting diverse microfauna in its native habitat.</p>
