                    <h1>Wormia hirta</h1>
<p>Wormia hirta, commonly known as the hairy worm plant, is a small, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often shed during drought periods to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Wormia hirta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its specialized morphology and water-storing tissues.</p>
