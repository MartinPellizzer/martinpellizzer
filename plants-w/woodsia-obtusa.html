                    <h1>Woodsia obtusa</h1>
<p>Woodsia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood-sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
