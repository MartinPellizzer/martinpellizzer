                    <h1>Welwitschia filifolia</h1>
<p>Welwitschia filifolia, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two long, rope-like leaves that grow from a woody stem and can reach lengths of over 4 meters. The plant has a unique ability to survive in extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fibrous leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Welwitschia filifolia is considered a living fossil and a symbol of the desert's resilience.</p>
