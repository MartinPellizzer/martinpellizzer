<p>Werauhia broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway Werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to humid environments.

Its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences, often in shades of red or orange, make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in botanical gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in well-drained, bright but indirect light.</p>
