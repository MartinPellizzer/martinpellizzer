<p>Werauhia ampla, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, with some varieties displaying vivid red, orange, or yellow hues. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, are usually hidden within the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Werauhia ampla thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
