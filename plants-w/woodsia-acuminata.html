                    <h1>Woodsia acuminata</h1>
<p>Woodsia acuminata, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pinnately compound leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clusters of kidney-shaped, greenish-brown spores. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in low-light conditions.</p>
