                    <h1>Wedelia trilobata</h1>
<p>Wedelia trilobata, commonly known as the creeping oxeye or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
