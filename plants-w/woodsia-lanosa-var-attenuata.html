                    <h1>Woodsia lanosa var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Woodsia lanosa var. attenuata, commonly known as the woolly woodsia, is a fern species characterized by its soft, velvety fronds covered in fine, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in forested areas with moist, shaded conditions. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often reduced in size, giving it a compact, cushion-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
