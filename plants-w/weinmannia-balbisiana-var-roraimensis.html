                    <h1>Weinmannia balbisiana var. roraimensis</h1>
<p>Weinmannia balbisiana var. roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cunoniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, adapting to the harsh conditions of the tepui landscape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution in the tepui regions.</p>
