<p>Wurmbea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone wormbea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tuberous roots and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for studying plant responses to nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
