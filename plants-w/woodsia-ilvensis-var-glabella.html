                    <h1>Woodsia ilvensis var. glabella</h1>
<p>Woodsia ilvensis var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood sorrel, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is often found in rocky or woodland areas with high humidity.</p>
