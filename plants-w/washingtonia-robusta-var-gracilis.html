                    <h1>Washingtonia robusta var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Washingtonia robusta var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender date palm, is a variant of the Mexican fan palm characterized by its narrower, more upright growth habit compared to the typical Washingtonia robusta.</p>
<p>It features long, feather-like leaves that are typically lighter green in color and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is less commonly cultivated for fruit production than its parent species. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 11, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to arid environments.</p>
