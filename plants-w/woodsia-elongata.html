                    <h1>Woodsia elongata</h1>
<p>Woodsia elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodsia, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Woodsia elongata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories.</p>
