                    <h1>Wilhelminia</h1>
<p>Wilhelminia, commonly known as desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in the evening. Wilhelminia species are typically low-growing shrubs with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. They have a deep root system that allows them to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Wilhelminia tamariscina, which is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
