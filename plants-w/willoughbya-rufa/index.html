                            <h1>Willoughbya Rufa</h1>
<p>Rufous willoughbya, scientifically known as Willoughbya rufa, is a unique and striking plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. This species belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves and showy, red-orange flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often found in the floodplains of the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant's name derives from its rufous, or reddish-brown, coloration, which is most prominent in its foliage and floral structures. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Willoughbya rufa is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
