                    <h1>Warnockia</h1>
<p>Warnockia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short-lived lifecycle, with its flowers opening only under specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to study. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Warnockia is considered a botanical curiosity and is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts and researchers alike.</p>
