                    <h1>Willichia</h1>
<p>Willichia, commonly known as the "water lily of the tropics," is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Willichia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and Southeast Asia. Their roots are submerged, anchoring them in shallow waters, while their leaves provide shade and oxygen to the aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The flowers typically open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
