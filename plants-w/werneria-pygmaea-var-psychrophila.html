                    <h1>Werneria pygmaea var. psychrophila</h1>
<p>Werneria pygmaea var. psychrophila, commonly known as the Antarctic haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, dense shoots and dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. This variety is adapted to extreme conditions, including low temperatures and high UV radiation, making it a resilient species in polar and alpine regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are typically borne on short stalks and release spores during the brief growing season.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other cold-adapted organisms.</p>
