                    <h1>Wheelerella</h1>
<p>Wheelerella, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a type of planthopper native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is notable for its transparent, waxy wings that give it a distinctive appearance. This insect is a significant agricultural pest, particularly for its role in spreading plant pathogens. Wheelerella feeds on the sap of a wide range of plants, including many economically important crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the undersides of leaves, where the nymphs develop through several instars before reaching adulthood.</p>
