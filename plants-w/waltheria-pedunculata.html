                    <h1>Waltheria pedunculata</h1>
<p>Waltheria pedunculata, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
