<p>Weingartia, commonly known as the rat-tail cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. They are characterized by their short, cylindrical stems that often resemble a rat's tail, hence their common name. The stems are typically covered in white or grayish spines, and they produce small, yellow flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Weingartia species are popular among cactus enthusiasts due to their compact size, ease of care, and aesthetic appeal.</p>
