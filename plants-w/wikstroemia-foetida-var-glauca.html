<p>Wikstroemia foetida var. glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to salty air and wind-swept environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh coastal climates.</p>
