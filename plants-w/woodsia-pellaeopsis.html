<p>Woodsia pellaeopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its intricate leaf structure and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
