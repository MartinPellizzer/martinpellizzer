<p>Weigeltia detergens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which are often followed by orange or red capsules containing seeds. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or wetland areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
