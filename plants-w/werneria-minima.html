<p>Werneria minima, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters above the water surface.</p>
<p>Werneria minima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
