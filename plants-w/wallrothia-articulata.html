                    <h1>Wallrothia articulata</h1>
<p>Wallrothia articulata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, segmented stems that resemble the limbs of a skeleton, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Wallrothia articulata is a member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family, known for its succulent species adapted to extreme conditions.</p>
