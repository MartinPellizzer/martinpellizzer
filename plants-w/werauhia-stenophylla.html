                    <h1>Werauhia stenophylla</h1>
<p>Werauhia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed werauhia, is a herbaceous plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Werauhia stenophylla produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
