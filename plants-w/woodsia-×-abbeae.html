                    <h1>Woodsia × abbeae</h1>
<p>Woodsia × abbeae, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Woodsia orientalis and Woodsia fragilis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is primarily propagated through spore dispersal rather than sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
