                    <h1>Waitzia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Waitzia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which contains high concentrations of sulfur compounds. The lichen's structure consists of a layered cortex, algal layers, and a fungal matrix, typical of foliose lichens. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments and sulfur-containing metabolites.</p>
