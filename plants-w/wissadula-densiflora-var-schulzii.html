                    <h1>Wissadula densiflora var. schulzii</h1>
<p>Wissadula densiflora var. schulzii, commonly known as the Schultze's dense-flowered pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Pachypodium genus, sharing similar adaptations to drought and heat.</p>
