                    <h1>Wallacea</h1>
<p>Wallacea, commonly known as the Wallacea region, is a biogeographical area in Indonesia characterized by its unique biodiversity.</p>
<p>It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who noted the distinct faunal and floral differences between the eastern and western parts of the archipelago. The region is home to a rich variety of plant species, many of which are endemic to the area. Wallacea's flora includes diverse ecosystems such as tropical rainforests, mangroves, and mountainous regions, supporting a wide range of plant life.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Wallacea lies in its role as a center of endemism and its contribution to global plant diversity.</p>
