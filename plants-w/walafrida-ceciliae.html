                    <h1>Walafrida ceciliae</h1>
<p>Walafrida ceciliae, commonly known as the celestial bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to soft lavender, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, helping to reflect intense sunlight. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Walafrida ceciliae is considered an endangered species.</p>
