                    <h1>Weinmannia hirta var. glabra</h1>
<p>Weinmannia hirta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat.</p>
