                    <h1>Wissadula periplocifolia f. cordata</h1>
<p>Wissadula periplocifolia f. cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf wissadula, is a unique variant of the Wissadula genus native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its distinctive cordate, or heart-shaped, leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in the early spring.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is valued in botanical gardens for its unusual leaf morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
