                    <h1>Welfia regia</h1>
<p>Welfia regia, commonly known as the royal welfia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight. The plant produces vibrant purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Welfia regia thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
