                    <h1>Wormia coromandelina</h1>
<p>Wormia coromandelina, commonly known as the Indian liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a stem-like structure with spirally arranged leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores.</p>
<p>Wormia coromandelina is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
