                    <h1>Weinmannia sorbifolia var. typica</h1>
<p>Weinmannia sorbifolia var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found in rocky soils along the shoreline.</p>
