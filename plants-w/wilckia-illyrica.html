<p>Wilckia illyrica, commonly known as the Illlyric Wilckia, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a unique, almost ethereal appearance that has made it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wilckia illyrica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
