<p>Woodwardia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sword fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
