                    <h1>Woodwardia prolifera</h1>
<p>Woodwardia prolifera, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender sterile frond that is often tinged with reddish hues, giving it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that emerge from the base of the plant, forming a distinctive "cinnamon" or "cabbage" shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
