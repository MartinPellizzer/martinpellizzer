                    <h1>Windsoria pallida</h1>
<p>Windsoria pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and filtered sunlight to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Windsoria pallida is listed as an endangered species.</p>
