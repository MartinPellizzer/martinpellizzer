<p>Woodsia pallida, commonly known as the pale woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and it produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Woodsia pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
