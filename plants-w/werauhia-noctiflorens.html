                    <h1>Werauhia noctiflorens</h1>
<p>Werauhia noctiflorens, commonly known as the night-blooming werauhia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white flowers, which open at night. These flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>Its unique floral timing and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
