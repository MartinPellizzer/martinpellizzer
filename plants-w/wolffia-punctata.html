                    <h1>Wolffia punctata</h1>
<p>Wolffia punctata, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual plants typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, leaf-like structure that serves multiple functions. Wolffia punctata reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, often forming dense mats on the surface of still water.</p>
<p>It is widely distributed in freshwater habitats across the globe and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
