                    <h1>Woodsia veitchii</h1>
<p>Woodsia veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's wood sorrel, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires specific care to mimic its natural conditions.</p>
