<p>Werneria fontii, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in wet, swampy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies along water margins.</p>
<p>Werneria fontii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability.</p>
