                    <h1>Wolffia angusta</h1>
<p>Wolffia angusta, commonly known as water lentil, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia angusta thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, where new plants develop from the fragmentation of existing fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate and high nutrient content, it is also considered a potential candidate for sustainable food and biofuel production.</p>
