                    <h1>Werauhia latissima</h1>
<p>Werauhia latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding cup at the center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees or rocks. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Werauhia latissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
