<p>Waltheria coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features gray-green, rough-textured leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.

<p>Waltheria coriacea is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
