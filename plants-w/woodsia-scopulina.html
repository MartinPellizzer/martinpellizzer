                <h1>Woodsia scopulina</h1>
<p>Woodsia scopulina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of brownish hair. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its harsh habitat. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Woodsia scopulina is a hardy species well adapted to cool, moist climates with limited light.</p>
