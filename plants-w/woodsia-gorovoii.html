                    <h1>Woodsia gorovoii</h1>
<p>Woodsia gorovoii, commonly known as the Gorovoii wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Woodsia gorovoii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
