                    <h1>Winterlia uliginosa</h1>
<p>Winterlia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Winterlia uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
