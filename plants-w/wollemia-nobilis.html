                    <h1>Wollemia nobilis</h1>
<p>Wollemia nobilis, commonly known as the Wollemi pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to a small area in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is one of the few surviving members of the family Araucariaceae, which dates back to the time of the dinosaurs. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and drooping, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces unique, elongated cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a living fossil and a valuable subject of botanical study.</p>
