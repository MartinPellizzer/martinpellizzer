                    <h1>Wulfhorstia</h1>
<p>Wulfhorstia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear small, yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Wulfhorstia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
