                    <h1>Werauhia picta</h1>
<p>Werauhia picta, commonly known as the "Painted Werauhia," is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that can range from red to yellow, often resembling flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Werauhia picta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
