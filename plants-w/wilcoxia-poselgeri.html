<p>Wilcoxia poselgeri, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. This resilient species has adapted to extreme arid conditions by developing a deep root system and reduced leaf surfaces. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, and it blooms during the brief rainy season.</p>
<p>Wilcoxia poselgeri is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a unique example of desert flora.</p>
