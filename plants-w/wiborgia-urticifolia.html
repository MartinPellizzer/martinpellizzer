<p>Wiborgia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, green stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Wiborgia urticifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
