                    <h1>Wikstroemia foetida var. tahitensis</h1>
<p>Wikstroemia foetida var. tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian sandarac, is a shrub native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces a fragrant, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional Polynesian crafts and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in coastal and limestone soils, often growing in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
