<p>Wolfia spectabilis, commonly known as the floating starwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Wolfiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, star-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Wolfia spectabilis is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
