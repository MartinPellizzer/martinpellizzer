<p>Wigginsia arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's wigginsia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Podostemales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique aquatic adaptations, including its root system that anchors it to submerged rocks. The plant exhibits a highly specialized morphology, with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. It thrives in fast-flowing streams and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
