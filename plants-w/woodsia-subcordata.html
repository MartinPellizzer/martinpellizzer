                    <h1>Woodsia subcordata</h1>
<p>Woodsia subcordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, supporting the growth of its upright, lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
