<p>Weinmannia elliptica, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Weinmannia elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in urban landscapes.</p>
