                    <h1>Woodwardia × semicordata</h1>
<p>Woodwardia × semicordata, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Woodwardia radicans and Woodwardia arendsea.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features large, shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive semi-circular base, giving it its common name. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bright green, with a slightly wavy margin, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
