<p>Wrightia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim Wrightia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
