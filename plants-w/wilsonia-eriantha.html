<p>Wilsonia eriantha, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wilsonia eriantha is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
