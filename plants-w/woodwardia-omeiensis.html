<p>Woodwardia omeiensis, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a subject of scientific interest and a rare botanical curiosity.</p>
