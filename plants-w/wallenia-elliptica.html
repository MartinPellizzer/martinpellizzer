<p>[WRONG START] Walenia elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical wallenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.

Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Wallenia elliptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils.</p>
