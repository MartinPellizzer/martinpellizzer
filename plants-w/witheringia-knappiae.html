                <h1>Witheringia knappiae</h1>
<p>Witheringia knappiae, commonly known as the Knapp's witheringia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Witheringia knappiae is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its chemical composition.</p>
