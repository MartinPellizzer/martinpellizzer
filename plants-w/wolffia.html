                    <h1>Wolffia</h1>
<p>Wolffia, commonly known as water moss, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the order Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are among the smallest flowering plants, with individual specimens often measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. They possess a simple morphology, consisting of a small, leaf-like structure with a single node and a short stem.</p>
<p>Wolffia plants reproduce both sexually and asexually, primarily through the production of tiny, free-floating seeds.</p>
