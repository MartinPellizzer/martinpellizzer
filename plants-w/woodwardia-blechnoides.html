                    <h1>Woodwardia blechnoides</h1>
<p>Woodwardia blechnoides, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that resemble swords, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its intricate spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
