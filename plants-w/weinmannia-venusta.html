                    <h1>Weinmannia venusta</h1>
<p>Weinmannia venusta, commonly known as the silver mistflower, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Weinmannia venusta is often found in coastal chaparral and is adapted to salty air and strong winds.</p>
