                    <h1>Wendlandia urceolata</h1>
<p>Wendlandia urceolata, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a waterwheel, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
