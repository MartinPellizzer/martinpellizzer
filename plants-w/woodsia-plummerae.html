                    <h1>Woodsia plummerae</h1>
<p>Woodsia plummerae, commonly known as the Plummer's wood sorrel, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems within its native habitat.</p>
