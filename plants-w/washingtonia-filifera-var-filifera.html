                    <h1>Washingtonia filifera var. filifera</h1>
<p>Washingtonia filifera var. filifera, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a single, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, brownish layer called the 'bark.'. The plant produces large, feathery, bright green leaves that can reach up to 10 feet in length. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates.</p>
<p>The Mexican fan palm is also notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which makes it suitable for coastal environments.</p>
