                    <h1>Wittrockia minuta</h1>
<p>Wittrockia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact, tree-like structure with a stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the crown. Wittrockia minuta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and requiring minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
