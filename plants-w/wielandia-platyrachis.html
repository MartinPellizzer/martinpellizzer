<p>Wielandia platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, rhizomatous growth and large, divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Wielandia platyrachis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
