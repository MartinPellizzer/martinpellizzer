<p>Withania microphysalis, commonly known as the small-fruited ashwagandha, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It has a woody stem and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other Withania species.</p>
