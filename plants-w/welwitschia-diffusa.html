<p>Welwitschia diffusa, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to access groundwater in the arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions.</p>
