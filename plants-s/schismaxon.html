<p>Schismaxon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin roots that anchor it to tree bark and absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are white and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Schismaxon is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
