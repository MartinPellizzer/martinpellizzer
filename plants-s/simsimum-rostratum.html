                    <h1>Simsimum rostratum</h1>
<p>Simsimum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Simsimum rostratum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment.</p>
