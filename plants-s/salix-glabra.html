                    <h1>Salix glabra</h1>
<p>Salix glabra, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant has opposite, elongated leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Salix glabra is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams and lakes, and it plays an important role in riparian ecosystems.</p>
