                    <h1>Salix phylicifolia var. ovata</h1>
<p>Salix phylicifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf willow or ovate willow, is a variant of the willow genus native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves, which are typically smooth and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal, and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a flexible, multi-stemmed structure that allows it to withstand water flow and flooding.</p>
