                    <h1>Saxifraga compacta</h1>
<p>Saxifraga compacta, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Saxifraga compacta is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and tundra environments.</p>
