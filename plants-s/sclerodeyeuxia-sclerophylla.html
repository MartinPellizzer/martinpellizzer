                    <h1>Sclerodeyeuxia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Sclerodeyeuxia sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody foliage and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its adaptations, such as thick cuticles and succulent leaves, make it well-suited for survival in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Sclerodeyeuxia sclerophylla plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is a valuable component of its ecosystem.</p>
