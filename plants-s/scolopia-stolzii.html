                    <h1>Scolopia stolzii</h1>
<p>Scolopia stolzii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features hairy, branched stems that are often prostrate or ascending, adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scolopia stolzii is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
