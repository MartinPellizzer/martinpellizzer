                    <h1>Sporobolus airoides var. minor</h1>
<p>Sporobolus airoides var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
