<p>Siebera billardierei, commonly known as the Mountain Pepper, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
