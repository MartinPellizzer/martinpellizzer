<p>It is characterized by its unique, globular inflorescence that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
