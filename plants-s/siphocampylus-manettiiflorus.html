<p>Siphocampylus manettiiflorus, commonly known as the Manetti's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Siphocampylus manettiiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
