                    <h1>Staavia rupestris</h1>
<p>Staavia rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Staavia rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
