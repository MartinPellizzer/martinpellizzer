                    <h1>Sarracenia drummondii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
