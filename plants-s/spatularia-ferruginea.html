                    <h1>Spatularia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Spatularia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted spatula fungus, is a member of the family Marasmiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, saprophytic fungus that typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in forested areas. The cap is spatula-shaped, with a reddish-brown coloration that becomes more intense with age. Its gills are closely spaced and initially pale, turning brown as the fungus matures.</p>
<p>Spatularia ferruginea is often found in humid environments and is not considered edible due to its bitter taste and potential toxicity.</p>
