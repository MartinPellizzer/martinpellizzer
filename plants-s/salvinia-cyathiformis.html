                    <h1>Salvinia cyathiformis</h1>
<p>Salvinia cyathiformis, commonly known as the Cyathiform Salvinia, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America and is characterized by its small, ovate, and often overlapping leaves. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically located near the leaf margins. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it has been introduced.</p>
