                    <h1>Sisymbrium atrovirens</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium atrovirens, commonly known as the blackstem broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, though it does not produce true flowers or seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants in arid or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, influencing the growth of its host species.</p>
