                            <h1>Sorghum Annulatum</h1>
<p>Sorghum annulatum is a unique grass species known for its striking appearance and ecological significance. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in harsh environments where few plants can survive. Its distinctive features include tall stalks and colorful, ring-like patterns on its leaves. This plant plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability. Due to its resilience, it is increasingly being studied for potential agricultural and environmental applications.</p>
