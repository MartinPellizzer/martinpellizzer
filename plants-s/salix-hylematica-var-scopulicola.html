                    <h1>Salix hylematica var. scopulicola</h1>
<p>Salix hylematica var. scopulicola, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
