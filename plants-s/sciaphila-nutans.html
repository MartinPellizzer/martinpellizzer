                    <h1>Sciaphila nutans</h1>
<p>Sciaphila nutans, commonly known as the nodding ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's flowers are small, greenish-white, and emit a faint fragrance, typically blooming at night. Sciaphila nutans thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rare occurrence, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
