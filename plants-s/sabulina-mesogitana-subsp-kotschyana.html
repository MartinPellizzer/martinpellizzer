<p>Sabulina mesogitana subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschyan's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
