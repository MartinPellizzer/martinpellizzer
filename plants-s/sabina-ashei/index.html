                            <h1>Sabina Ashei</h1>
<p>Ashe's juniper, scientifically known as Sabina ashei, is a resilient evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is commonly found in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, berry-like cones that provide food for wildlife. Ashe's juniper plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems. Despite its hardy nature, it is often mistaken for a tree due to its size and shape.</p>
