<p>Saccolabium arachnanthe, commonly known as the spider-thorn acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reduced to scales, a feature typical of many acacia species. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Saccolabium arachnanthe is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of arid ecosystems.</p>
