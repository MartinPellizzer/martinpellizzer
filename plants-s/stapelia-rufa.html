<p>Stapelia rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow to orange in color, often with a strong odor resembling decay. Its leaves are usually small and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Stapelia rufa is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
