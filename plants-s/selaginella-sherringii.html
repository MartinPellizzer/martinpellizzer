<p>Selaginella sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Selaginella sherringii is notable for its resilience and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance.</p>
