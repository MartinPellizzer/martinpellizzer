<p>Salix vulpina var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in alpine meadows. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments.</p>
