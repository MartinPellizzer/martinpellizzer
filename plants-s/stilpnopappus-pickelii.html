                    <h1>Stilpnopappus pickelii</h1>
<p>Stilpnopappus pickelii, commonly known as the Pickel's burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, hairy bracts that form a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
