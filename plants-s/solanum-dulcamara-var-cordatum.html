                    <h1>Solanum dulcamara var. cordatum</h1>
<p>Solanum dulcamara var. cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that transition from green to yellowish-red as they mature. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along fences.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a horticultural curiosity and a potential invasive species in certain areas.</p>
