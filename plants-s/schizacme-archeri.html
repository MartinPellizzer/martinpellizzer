                    <h1>Schizacme archeri</h1>
<p>Schizacme archeri, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in association with other wetland flora. Its unique habitat requirements make it a sensitive indicator of wetland health and ecological stability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizacme archeri is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
