                    <h1>Stellaria ovata f. paradoxa</h1>
<p>Stellaria ovata f. paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical starwort, is a rare horticultural form of the common starwort.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like flowers with five petals that are often a striking combination of white and pink. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique floral morphology and its status as a rare cultivar in botanical gardens.</p>
