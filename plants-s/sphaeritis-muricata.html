                    <h1>Sphaeritis muricata</h1>
<p>Sphaeritis muricata, commonly known as the rough-leaved sphaeritis, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Sphaeritis muricata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
