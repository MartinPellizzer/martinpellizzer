<p>Symphytum orientale, commonly known as the oriental comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are particularly thick and fleshy, which allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Symphytum orientale is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
