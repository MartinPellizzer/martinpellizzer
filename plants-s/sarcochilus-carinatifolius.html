<p>Sarcochilus carinatifolius, commonly known as the ridged-leaf saxifrage, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, strap-shaped leaves with prominent midribs that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
