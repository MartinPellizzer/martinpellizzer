                    <h1>Sacoila squamulosa</h1>
<p>Sacoila squamulosa, commonly known as the hairy leathery fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds covered in fine, scale-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi-directionally pinnate, with a complex arrangement of leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value.</p>
