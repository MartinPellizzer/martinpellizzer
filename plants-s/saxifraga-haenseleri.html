<p>Saxifraga haenseleri, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
