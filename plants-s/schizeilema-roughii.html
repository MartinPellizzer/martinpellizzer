                    <h1>Schizeilema roughii</h1>
<p>Schizeilema roughii, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing stature and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. Schizeilema roughii has a fibrous root system that aids in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
