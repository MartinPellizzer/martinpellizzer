                    <h1>Senecio polycephalus</h1>
<p>Senecio polycephalus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a dense covering of fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Senecio polycephalus produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
