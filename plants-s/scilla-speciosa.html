                    <h1>Scilla speciosa</h1>
<p>Scilla speciosa, commonly known as the showy squill, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, typical of many bulbous plants. Scilla speciosa thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit, which adds color to gardens during the transition from winter to spring.</p>
