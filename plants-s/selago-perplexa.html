                    <h1>Selago perplexa</h1>
<p>Selago perplexa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. The plant thrives in wet, pine flatwood habitats and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique ecological role and its value in conservation efforts.</p>
