                    <h1>Solanum cleistogamum</h1>
<p>Solanum cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closed, self-pollinating flowers that do not open, a trait known as cleistogamy. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique reproductive strategy, it plays a role in certain ecological systems where pollinators are scarce.</p>
