<p>Stevia elatior var. typica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with tiny, sweet-tasting glands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is cultivated for its leaves, which are used as a natural sweetener. Stevia elatior var. typica thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its high concentration of steviol glycosides gives it a strong, sweet flavor without the caloric content of sugar.</p>
