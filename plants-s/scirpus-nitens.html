<p>Scirpus nitens, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers, which appear in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Scirpus nitens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
