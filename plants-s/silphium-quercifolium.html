<p>Silphium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. Its root system is notable for its thick, fleshy rhizomes, which were historically valued for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Silphium quercifolium thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
