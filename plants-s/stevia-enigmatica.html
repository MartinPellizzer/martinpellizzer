                    <h1>Stevia enigmatica</h1>
<p>Stevia enigmatica, commonly known as the mysterious sweetleaf, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Stevia enigmatica remains a subject of botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
