<p>Spartina longispica, commonly known as the long-spiked cordgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Spartina longispica plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
