<p>Saxifraga × forojulensis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions.</p>
