                    <h1>Sedum cockerellii</h1>
<p>Sedum cockerellii, commonly known as the Cockerell's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a dense rosette, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for desert landscapes.</p>
