<p>Sabulina biebersteinii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in some areas.</p>
