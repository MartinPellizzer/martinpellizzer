<p>Salvinia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged surfaces, while its floating leaves help in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Salvinia auriculata is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense vegetation in ponds and lakes.</p>
