                    <h1>Sarcolobus pepo</h1>
<p>Sarcolobus pepo, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fruit-like structures called "tunas.". These tunas are not only a food source for various animals but also have historical and cultural significance.</p>
<p>Additionally, the plant's spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
