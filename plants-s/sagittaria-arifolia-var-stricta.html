                    <h1>Sagittaria arifolia var. stricta</h1>
<p>Sagittaria arifolia var. stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, often floating on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments in wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of aquatic environments, including ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
