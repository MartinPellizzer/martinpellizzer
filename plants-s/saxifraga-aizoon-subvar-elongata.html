                    <h1>Saxifraga aizoon subvar. elongata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aizoon subvar. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aizoon subvar. elongata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
