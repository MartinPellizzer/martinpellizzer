                    <h1>Striga squamigera</h1>
<p>Striga squamigera, commonly known as the red sandmat, is an annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Striga squamigera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to enter dormancy during droughts.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems but can also be a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
