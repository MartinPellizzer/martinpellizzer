<p>Spodiopogon albidus, commonly known as the white feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and delicate, white to pale blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its soft, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Spodiopogon albidus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
