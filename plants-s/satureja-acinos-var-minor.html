                    <h1>Satureja acinos var. minor</h1>
<p>Satureja acinos var. minor, commonly known as dwarf mountain savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically features small, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, pungent aroma, and it produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Satureja acinos, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
