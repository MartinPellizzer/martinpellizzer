                    <h1>Senecio filifolius var. fremontii</h1>
<p>Senecio filifolius var. fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont's ice plant, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its low maintenance and drought tolerance contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
