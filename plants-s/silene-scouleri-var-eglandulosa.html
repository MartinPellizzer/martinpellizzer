                    <h1>Silene scouleri var. eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Silene scouleri var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The plant produces showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, giving it its varietal name.</p>
