The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often resembling leaves, which helps it blend into its surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
