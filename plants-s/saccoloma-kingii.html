                <h1>Saccoloma kingii</h1>
<p>Saccoloma kingii, commonly known as the King's saccoloma, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saccoloma kingii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
