                    <h1>Stevia seleriana</h1>
<p>Stevia seleriana, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural sweetener, making it a popular alternative to sugar in many cultures.</p>
<p>Stevia seleriana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
