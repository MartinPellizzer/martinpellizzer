                    <h1>Syringodea pulvinitormis</h1>
<p>Syringodea pulvinitormis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fibrous root system and lacks leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
