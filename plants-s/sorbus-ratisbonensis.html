                    <h1>Sorbus ratisbonensis</h1>
<p>Sorbus ratisbonensis, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows.</p>
