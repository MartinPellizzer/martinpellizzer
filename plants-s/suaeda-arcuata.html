<p>Suaeda arcuata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or green. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Suaeda arcuata plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining biodiversity in harsh desert ecosystems.</p>
