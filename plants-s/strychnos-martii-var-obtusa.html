                    <h1>Strychnos martii var. obtusa</h1>
<p>Strychnos martii var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed poisonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often broad and ovate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It contains toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which make it highly poisonous to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution.</p>
