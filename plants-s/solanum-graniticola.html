                    <h1>Solanum graniticola</h1>
<p>Solanum graniticola, commonly known as the granite tomato, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tomato-like fruits. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils, which is reflected in its common name. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces flowers that are usually white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Solanum graniticola is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
