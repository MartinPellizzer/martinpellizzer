The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper portion of the stem. It is often grown as a forage crop due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
