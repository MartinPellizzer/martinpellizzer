                    <h1>Strombosiopsis</h1>
<p>Strombosiopsis, commonly known as the horned sea hare, is a genus of sea slugs belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their soft, gelatinous bodies and often vibrant coloration. They are found in tropical and subtropical waters, typically in shallow marine environments. Strombosiopsis species are known for their unique, horn-like protrusions on their bodies, which may serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Their diet primarily consists of algae, and they play a role in marine ecosystems through their grazing activities.</p>
