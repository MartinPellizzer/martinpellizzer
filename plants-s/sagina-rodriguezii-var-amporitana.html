<p>Sagina rodriguezii var. amporitana, commonly known as the Amorita sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, closely packed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
