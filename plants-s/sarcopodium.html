                    <h1>Sarcopodium</h1>
<p>Sarcopodium, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, still water.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, ribbon-like leaves that float just beneath the water's surface. The plant lacks true roots and stems, relying instead on its flat, leaf-like structures for nutrient absorption. Sarcopodium is often found in ponds, marshes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and unusual growth habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
