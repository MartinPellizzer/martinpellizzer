                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos bakeri</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's globe-stephanos, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, spherical shape. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, Mediterranean climate to flourish. Its floral display is particularly notable during the spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
