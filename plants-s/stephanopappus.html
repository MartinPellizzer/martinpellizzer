<p>Stephanopappus, commonly known as the common composite or desert composite, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their daisy-like flowers, with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pink ray flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
