<p>Stylosanthes guianensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to South America.</p>

The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a valuable species in agroforestry systems.</p>
