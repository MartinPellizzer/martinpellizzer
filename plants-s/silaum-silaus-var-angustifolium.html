                    <h1>Silaum silaus var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Silaum silaus var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leafed silaum, is a variant of the silaum plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb characterized by its slender, angular stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other silaum species, particularly in leaf morphology and habitat preference.</p>
