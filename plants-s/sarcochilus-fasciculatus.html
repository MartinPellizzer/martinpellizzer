<p>Sarcochilus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered helmet orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the subtropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. The plant produces its showy blooms on lateral shoots, often in clusters, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Sarcochilus fasciculatus is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
