                    <h1>Scirpus cespitosus var. callosus</h1>
<p>Scirpus cespitosus var. callosus, commonly known as the rough bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that grow in water or very wet soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, bristle-like hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments, playing an important role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
