<p>Sagina apetala subsp.</p>
<p>filicaulis, commonly known as the slender leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme climates.</p>
