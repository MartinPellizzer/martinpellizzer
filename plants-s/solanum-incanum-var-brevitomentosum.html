<p>Solanum incanum var. brevitomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans.</p>
