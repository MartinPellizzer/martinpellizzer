<p>Silene caesia, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene caesia thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to its aquatic and semi-aquatic environment.</p>
