<p>Salix turuchanensis, commonly known as the Turuchan willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and typically grows in tundra and taiga ecosystems. The plant has slender, often multi-branched stems and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Salix turuchanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna.</p>
