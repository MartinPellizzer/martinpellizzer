<p>Stonecrop, scientifically known as Sempervivum tectorum proles murale, is a hardy succulent plant native to rocky and alpine regions. It is prized for its ability to thrive in poor soil and withstand harsh weather conditions. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that range in color from green to red and purple. Stonecrop is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal. Its resilience and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a durable, drought-tolerant plant.</p>
