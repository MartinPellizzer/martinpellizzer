                    <h1>Sarracenia × areolata</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × areolata, commonly known as the areola pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange to yellowish pitchers with a prominent areolar pattern on the upper surface. The plant's leaves are tubular and modified into pitfall traps that secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous habits, it is a popular specimen in both botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
