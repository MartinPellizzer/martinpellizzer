                    <h1>Stylocoryna ovata</h1>
<p>Stylocoryna ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Stylocoryna ovata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
