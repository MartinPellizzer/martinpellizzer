                    <h1>Santaloides anomala</h1>
<p>Santaloides anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, slender leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. It is known for its unique ability to survive in low-light conditions and its reliance on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
