                    <h1>Seriphidium gypsaceum</h1>
<p>Seriphidium gypsaceum, commonly known as the gypsum wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Seriphidium gypsaceum is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or gypsum-rich terrain.</p>
