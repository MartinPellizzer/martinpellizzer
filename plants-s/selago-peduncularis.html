<p>Selago peduncularis, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Selago peduncularis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
