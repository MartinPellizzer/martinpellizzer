                    <h1>Sarcoglottis picta var. variegata</h1>
<p>Sarcoglottis picta var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sarcoglottis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically surrounded by a spathe, a modified leaf-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The variegation in its foliage is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution.</p>
