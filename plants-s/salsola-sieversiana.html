<p>Salsola sieversiana, commonly known as Russian thornweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub with succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It is native to Central Asia and is often found in dry, coastal, or saline soils.</p>
<p>Salsola sieversiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas due to its extensive root system.</p>
