                    <h1>Schoenus nigricans var. plurisquamatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus nigricans var. plurisquamatus, commonly known as the black rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, dark green stems that are often covered with a layer of dark, waxy cuticle, giving it its characteristic blackish appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marshy areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib and a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural strength.</p>
