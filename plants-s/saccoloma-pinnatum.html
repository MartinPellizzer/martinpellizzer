<p>Saccoloma pinnatum, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in absorbing moisture from the environment.</p>
<p>Saccoloma pinnatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
