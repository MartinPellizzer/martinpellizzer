                    <h1>Simarubopsis</h1>
<p>Simarubopsis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its unique ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate the health of the host tree and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
