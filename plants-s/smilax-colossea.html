                    <h1>Smilax colossea</h1>
<p>Smilax colossea, commonly known as the red smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust, woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Smilax colossea is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it spreads through both rhizomes and seeds.</p>
