                    <h1>Saxifraga moschata var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga moschata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, mat-forming growth that helps it survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish-white, and appear in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
