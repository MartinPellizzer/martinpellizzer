<p>Sapium laurifolium, commonly known as the Chinese holly or Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
