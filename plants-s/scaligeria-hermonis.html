<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves that are often aromatic, and it blooms with white or pale yellow flowers from late spring to early summer.</p>
