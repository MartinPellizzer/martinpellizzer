                    <h1>Synaphea</h1>
<p>Synaphea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets that resemble petals, and its spiny, bract-like leaves. Synaphea species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where they thrive in saline environments. The plants produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in their spread along shorelines.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
