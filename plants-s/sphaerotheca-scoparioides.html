                    <h1>Sphaerotheca scoparioides</h1>
<p>Sphaerotheca scoparioides, commonly known as the common powdery mildew, is a fungal plant pathogen that affects a wide range of host plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by the formation of white, powdery sporulating patches on the upper surfaces of leaves. The fungus produces specialized structures called pycnidia, which contain conidia that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid conditions and can cause defoliation and reduced growth in infected plants.</p>
<p>Its impact is significant in both agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
