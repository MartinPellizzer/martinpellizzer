                    <h1>Salix wilhelmsiana var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Salix wilhelmsiana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper to a point, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
