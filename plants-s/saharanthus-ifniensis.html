                    <h1>Saharanthus ifniensis</h1>
<p>Saharanthus ifniensis, commonly known as the Ifni saharanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to extreme desert conditions through specialized root systems and water-conserving mechanisms. Its small, narrow leaves reduce surface area to minimize water loss, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saharanthus ifniensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
