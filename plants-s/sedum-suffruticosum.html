<p>Sedum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth pattern enables it to spread rapidly, making it an effective ground cover in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sedum suffruticosum is well-suited for rock gardens, xeriscaping, and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardiness.</p>
