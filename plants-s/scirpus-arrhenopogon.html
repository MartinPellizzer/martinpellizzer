<p>Scirpus arrhenopogon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has long, narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often submerged or just above the water surface. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and contribute to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Scirpus arrhenopogon plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
