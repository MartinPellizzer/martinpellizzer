                    <h1>Santalum preissii</h1>
<p>Santalum preissii, commonly known as the Western Australian sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the south-western region of Western Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species.</p>
