                    <h1>Sempervivum cruentum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum cruentum, commonly known as the crimson rosette plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees Mountains.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically red or purple in color, especially when exposed to full sun. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces upright, branching flower stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well adapted to rocky, alpine environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
