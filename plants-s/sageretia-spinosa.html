<p>Sageretia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny sageretia, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, spiny projections, and its small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Sageretia spinosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
