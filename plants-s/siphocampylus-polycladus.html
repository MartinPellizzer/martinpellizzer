<p>Siphocampylus polycladus, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the milkweed family. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, a common trait among milkweeds.</p>
<p>Siphocampylus polycladus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, although it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
