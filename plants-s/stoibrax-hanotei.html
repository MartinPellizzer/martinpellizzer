                    <h1>Stoibrax hanotei</h1>
<p>Stoibrax hanotei, commonly known as the Hanotei's mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Stoibrax hanotei thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
