                    <h1>Saccharum contractum</h1>
<p>Saccharum contractum, commonly known as the dwarf sugarcane.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sugarcane varieties. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in wetland environments. Its stems are thick and juicy, containing high concentrations of sucrose, making it valuable for sugar production.</p>
<p>However, due to its smaller size, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial sugarcane farming.</p>
