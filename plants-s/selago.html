<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, often blue or purple flowers. Selago species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
