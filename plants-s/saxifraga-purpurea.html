<p>Saxifraga purpurea, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, showy purple or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountain environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season.</p>
<p>Saxifraga purpurea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh habitat.</p>
