<p>Sclerocalyx, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. Sclerocalyx is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
