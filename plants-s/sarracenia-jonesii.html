                    <h1>Sarracenia jonesii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia jonesii, commonly known as Jones' pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a contrasting green or yellow base, which helps attract prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and high humidity.</p>
<p>Sarracenia jonesii is often found in bogs and wetlands, where it plays a unique role in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
