                    <h1>Selenipedium × clymene</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × clymene, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Selenipedium albertii and Selenipedium petraeum, characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
