<p>Stipa debilis var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
