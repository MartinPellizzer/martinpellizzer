                    <h1>Scleropoa rigida var. minor</h1>
<p>Scleropoa rigida var. minor, commonly known as the hard-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
