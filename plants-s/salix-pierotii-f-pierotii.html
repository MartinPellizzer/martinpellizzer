<p>Salix pierotii f. pierotii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery-white coating. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
