<p>Syngonanthus duidae var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms.</p>
