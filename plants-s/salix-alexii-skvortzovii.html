                    <h1>Salix alexii-skvortzovii</h1>
<p>Salix alexii-skvortzovii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems.</p>
