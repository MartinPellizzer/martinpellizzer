                    <h1>Sagittaria montevidensis var. scabra</h1>
<p>Sagittaria montevidensis var. scabra, commonly known as the rough arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, rough textures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense underwater stands, which can provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more rugged leaf surface compared to other Sagittaria species.</p>
