<p>Schistophyllidium bifurcum subsp.</p>
<p>orientale, commonly known as the Eastern Forkleaf, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated leaves, which are adapted to capture moisture from humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green or yellowish hue.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
