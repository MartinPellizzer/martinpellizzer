<p>Salix microstachya var. bordensis, commonly known as the Baltic willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or muddy soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
