<p>Santaloides minor subsp.</p>
<p>monadelpha, commonly known as the dwarf sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and reduced, often scale-like leaves on its stems.</p>
<p>The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
