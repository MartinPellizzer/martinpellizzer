<p>Syngonanthus leprieurii f. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in yellow or orange. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its unique reproductive strategy and ornamental flowers make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
