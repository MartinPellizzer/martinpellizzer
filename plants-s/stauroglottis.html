                    <h1>Stauroglottis</h1>
<p>Stauroglottis, commonly known as the starry glottis or false thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Stauroglottis species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in dry conditions. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Stauroglottis ciliata, which is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
