<p>Selaginella bahiensis subsp.</p>
<p>manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist soil. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are typically clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its morphological adaptations that enable it to survive in the competitive and nutrient-poor conditions of the rainforest floor.</p>
