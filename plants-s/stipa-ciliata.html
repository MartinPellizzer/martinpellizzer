                    <h1>Stipa ciliata</h1>
<p>Stipa ciliata, commonly known as the silky grass or slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Stipa ciliata is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
