                    <h1>Stryphnodendron venosum</h1>
<p>Stryphnodendron venosum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and compound leaves with a prominent venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density, rich color, and tonal qualities, making it popular in musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions.</p>
