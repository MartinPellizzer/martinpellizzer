<p>Styphelia madida subsp.</p>
<p>hirtigera, commonly known as the Hirtigera heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
