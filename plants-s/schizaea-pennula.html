<p>Schizaea pennula, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like appearance, with long, branching leaves that give it a soft, lacy texture. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Schizaea pennula lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
