<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often丛生, forming dense clumps. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to form a rosette at the base.</p>
