                    <h1>Sagina saginoides var. hesperia</h1>
<p>Sagina saginoides var. hesperia, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear or mountain mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover plant.</p>
