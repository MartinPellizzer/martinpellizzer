                    <h1>Stipa × consanguinea</h1>
<p>Stipa × consanguinea, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Stipa capillata and Stipa pennata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for erosion control and wildlife habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying polyploidy and hybridization in grasses.</p>
