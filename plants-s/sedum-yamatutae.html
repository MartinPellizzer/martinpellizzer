                <h1>Sedum yamatutae</h1>
<p>Sedum yamatutae, commonly known as the Yamatotai stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sedum yamatutae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
