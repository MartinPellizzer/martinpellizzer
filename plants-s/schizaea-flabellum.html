<p>Schizaea flabellum, commonly known as the basket moss, is a member of the family Schizaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a primitive fern that lacks true leaves and instead has whorls of spirally arranged, scale-like structures called stichids. The plant is epiphytic, often growing on the trunks of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, umbrella-like clusters called sorus.</p>
<p>Schizaea flabellum plays an important ecological role in maintaining moisture and soil stability in its habitat.</p>
