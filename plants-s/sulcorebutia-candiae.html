                    <h1>Sulcorebutia candiae</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia candiae, commonly known as the Canary Island cactus or the sun rose, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous woolly, spiny stems that branch out in a rosette formation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which bloom from the axils of the spines. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia candiae is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
