                    <h1>Striga junodii</h1>
<p>Striga junodii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, often causing significant damage to crops like sorghum and millet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with numerous branches. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food security, Striga junodii is a subject of ongoing research for control methods.</p>
