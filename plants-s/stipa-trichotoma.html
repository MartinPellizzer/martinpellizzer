                    <h1>Stipa trichotoma</h1>
<p>Stipa trichotoma, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted clusters of fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
