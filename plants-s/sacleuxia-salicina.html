                    <h1>Sacleuxia salicina</h1>
<p>Sacleuxia salicina, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to tolerate and even thrive in salty soils.</p>
<p>Sacleuxia salicina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
