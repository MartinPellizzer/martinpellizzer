                    <h1>Salicornia praecox</h1>
<p>Salicornia praecox, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to further prevent desiccation.</p>
<p>Salicornia praecox plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
