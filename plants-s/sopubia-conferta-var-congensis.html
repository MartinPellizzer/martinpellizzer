                    <h1>Sopubia conferta var. congensis</h1>
<p>Sopubia conferta var. congensis, commonly known as the Congo sopubia, is a perennial herb native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively understudied and remains a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
