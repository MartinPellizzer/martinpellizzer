                            <h1>Silene Depressa Var. Meyeri</h1>
<p>Meyer's catchfly, scientifically known as Silene depressa var. meyeri, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rocky slopes of the Sierra Nevada. This low-growing perennial is characterized by its pale pink to purple flowers and hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Meyer's catchfly is considered endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival. Its unique beauty and ecological importance make it a subject of both scientific study and botanical fascination.</p>
