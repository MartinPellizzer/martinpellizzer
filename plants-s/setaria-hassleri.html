<p>Setaria hassleri, commonly known as the silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it conserve moisture in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas.</p>
