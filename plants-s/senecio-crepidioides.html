<p>Senecio crepidioides, commonly known as the blue ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
