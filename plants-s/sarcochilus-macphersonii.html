<p>Sarcochilus macphersonii, commonly known as the Macpherson's sarcochilus, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces striking, fragrant flowers with yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly ornamental, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
