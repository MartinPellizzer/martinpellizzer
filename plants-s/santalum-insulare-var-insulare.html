                    <h1>Santalum insulare var. insulare</h1>
<p>Santalum insulare var. insulare, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemi-parasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its roots. Native to the islands of the Pacific, including Fiji and Tonga, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by woody fruits containing small, black seeds.</p>
