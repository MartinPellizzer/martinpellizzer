                    <h1>Sphaeropteris vaupelii</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact, both contributing to its reproductive strategy. Native to New Caledonia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
