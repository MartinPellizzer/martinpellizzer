<p>Salix reinii var. cyclophylloides, commonly known as the cyclophylloides willow, is a rare and specialized variant of the willow genus native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinctive, rounded base that sets it apart from other willow species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its floral structure includes catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it relies on wind pollination for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species.</p>
