<p>Stelis salomonica, commonly known as Solomon's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive greenish or purple throat. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting its evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Stelis salomonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions.</p>
