<p>Setaria cenchroides, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green florets that are arranged in a cylindrical spike, which is typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, where it can become a weed.</p>
<p>Setaria cenchroides is also used in some traditional practices and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation.</p>
