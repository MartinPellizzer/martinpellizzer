<p>Salix annularis, commonly known as the ring willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
