                    <h1>Schefflera tahanica</h1>
<p>Schefflera tahanica, commonly known as the Tahanica umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Schefflera tahanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
