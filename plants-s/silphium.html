                    <h1>Silphium</h1>
<p>Silphium, commonly known as the "Greek fennel," is a now-extinct plant native to the region of ancient Greece and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stature, reaching up to six feet in height, with large, umbrella-like flower heads. The plant's rhizomes and roots were highly valued for their medicinal properties, particularly for treating digestive ailments and as a contraceptive. Silphium was so prized that it became a major trade commodity, often used as currency in ancient times.</p>
<p>Its extinction is believed to have been caused by overharvesting and habitat loss, leading to its disappearance from the historical record.</p>
