<p>Secale ancestrale var. arenosum, commonly known as the sand rye, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sand dunes, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
