This plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and adjacent areas. It exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary adaptations and role in ecological studies of plant resilience.</p>
