                    <h1>Stisseria deflexa</h1>
<p>Stisseria deflexa, commonly known as the flexible stisseria, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,匍匐茎 (prostrate stems) that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Stisseria deflexa is considered endangered and is often found in protected wetland reserves.</p>
