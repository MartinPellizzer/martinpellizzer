<p>Setaria alonsoi, commonly known as the Alonzo's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Setaria alonsoi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
