                    <h1>Smilax tamnifolia</h1>
<p>Smilax tamnifolia, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively through underground stems. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in natural habitats.</p>
