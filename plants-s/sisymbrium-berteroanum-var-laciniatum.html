                    <h1>Sisymbrium berteroanum var. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium berteroanum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. It is native to South America and often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes a weed.</p>
