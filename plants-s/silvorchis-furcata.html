                    <h1>Silvorchis furcata</h1>
<p>Silvorchis furcata, commonly known as the forked orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific forest habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with flowers that often have a distinctive forked appearance in the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understorey of tropical or subtropical forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Silvorchis furcata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
