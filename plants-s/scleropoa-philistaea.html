<p>Scleropoa philistaea, commonly known as the Philistine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tough, fibrous leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Scleropoa philistaea is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional landscaping for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
