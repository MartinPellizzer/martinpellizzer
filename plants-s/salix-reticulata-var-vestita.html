<p>Salix reticulata var. vestita, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and often grayish-white, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance.</p>
<p>The silver willow is also valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
