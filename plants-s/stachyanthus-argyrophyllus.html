<p>Stachyanthus argyrophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf stachyanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
