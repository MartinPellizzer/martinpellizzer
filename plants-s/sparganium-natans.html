                    <h1>Sparganium natans</h1>
<p>Sparganium natans, commonly known as floating burr rush, is a water plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating stems that bear clusters of spadices, which are yellowish-green, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The fruiting structures, called burrs, are distinctive and can adhere to animals or clothing, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
