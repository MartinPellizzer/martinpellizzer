                    <h1>Senegalia subsessilis</h1>
<p>Senegalia subsessilis, commonly known as the burro bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
<p>Senegalia subsessilis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
