                    <h1>Salix magnifica var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Salix magnifica var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pendulous catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense, low-growing mats that help stabilize fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in colder climates as an ornamental plant.</p>
