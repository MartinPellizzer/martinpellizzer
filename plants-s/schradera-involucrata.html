<p>Schradera involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Schradera involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
