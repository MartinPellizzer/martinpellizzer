                    <h1>Sophia andrenarum</h1>
<p>Sophia andrenarum, commonly known as the honeybee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent, fragrant labellum that attracts pollinators such as bees. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, displaying a mix of yellow, green, and white hues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Sophia andrenarum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
