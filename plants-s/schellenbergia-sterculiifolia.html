<p>Schellenbergia sterculiifolia, commonly known as the stonecrop saxifrage, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Schellenbergia sterculiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
