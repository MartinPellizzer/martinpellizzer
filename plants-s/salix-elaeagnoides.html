                    <h1>Salix elaeagnoides</h1>
<p>Salix elaeagnoides, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside, and they turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Silver willow is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as riverbanks and woodland edges.</p>
