<p>Scirpus litoralis subsp.</p>
<p>thermalis, commonly known as the thermal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
