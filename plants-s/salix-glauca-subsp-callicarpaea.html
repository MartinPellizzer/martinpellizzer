<p>Salix glauca subsp.</p>
<p>callicarpaea, commonly known as the gray willow or narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-white bark that peels in thin layers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones.</p>
