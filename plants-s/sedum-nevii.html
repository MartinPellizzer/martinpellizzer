                    <h1>Sedum nevii</h1>
<p>Sedum nevii, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Sedum nevii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental appeal.</p>
