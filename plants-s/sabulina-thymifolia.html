<p>Sabulina thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in mountainous areas with limited vegetation.</p>
