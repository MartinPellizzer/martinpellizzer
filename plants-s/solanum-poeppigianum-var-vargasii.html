<p>Solanum poeppigianum var. vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant bears berries that mature to a deep blue or black color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species.
