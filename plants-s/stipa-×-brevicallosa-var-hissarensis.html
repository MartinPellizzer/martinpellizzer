                    <h1>Stipa × brevicallosa var. hissarensis</h1>
<p>Stipa × brevicallosa var. hissarensis, commonly known as the Hissarensis needlegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that often appear gray-green due to a dense covering of hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing branches, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies and potential for use in restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
