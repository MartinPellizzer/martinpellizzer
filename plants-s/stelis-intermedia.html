<p>Stelis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis intermedia is appreciated in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
