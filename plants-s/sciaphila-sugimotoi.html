<p>Sciaphila sugimotoi, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, especially at night. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to grow on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall understated appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciaphila sugimotoi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
