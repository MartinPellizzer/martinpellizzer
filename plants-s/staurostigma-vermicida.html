<p>Staurostigma vermicida, commonly known as the wormseed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Staurostigma vermicida is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey.</p>
