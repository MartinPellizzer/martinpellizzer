                    <h1>Satyrium bracteatum var. latebracteatum</h1>
<p>Satyrium bracteatum var. latebracteatum, commonly known as the late bract fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clump-forming habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in specialized leaf structures called indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
