<p>Sasa oseana, commonly known as Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a clump-forming grass species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, grassy texture. Sasa oseana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats or clumps over time.</p>
