<p>Sorbus commixta var. ulleungensis, commonly known as the Ulleung Island whitebeam, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the Korean island of Ulleungdo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5–7 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
