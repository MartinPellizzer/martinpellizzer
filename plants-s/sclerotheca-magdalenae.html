                    <h1>Sclerotheca magdalenae</h1>
<p>Sclerotheca magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Sclerotheca magdalenae is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
