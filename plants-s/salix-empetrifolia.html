                    <h1>Salix empetrifolia</h1>
<p>Salix empetrifolia, commonly known as the rock willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
