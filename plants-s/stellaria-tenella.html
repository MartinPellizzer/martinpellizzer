<p>Stellaria tenella, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds.</p>
<p>Stellaria tenella is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats.</p>
