<p>Schizachyrium gracile, commonly known as slender grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Schizachyrium gracile is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
