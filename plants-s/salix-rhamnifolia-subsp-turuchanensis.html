<p>Salix rhamnifolia subsp.</p>
<p>turuchanensis, commonly known as Turuchan willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native environment.</p>
