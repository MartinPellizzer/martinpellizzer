The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its botanical features include a woody stem and fibrous roots adapted for nutrient absorption from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
