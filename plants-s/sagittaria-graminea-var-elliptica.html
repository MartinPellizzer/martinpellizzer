                    <h1>Sagittaria graminea var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Sagittaria graminea var. elliptica, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are broad and elliptical, often floating on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water level. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
