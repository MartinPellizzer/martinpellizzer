                    <h1>Salix atrocinerea f. sennenii</h1>
<p>Salix atrocinerea f. sennenii, commonly known as the black willow sennii form, is a rare and distinctive willow species native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. This form exhibits unique morphological traits compared to the typical Salix atrocinerea, including differences in leaf structure and growth habits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
