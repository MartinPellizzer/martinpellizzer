                    <h1>Staphidium astrotrichum</h1>
<p>Staphidium astrotrichum, commonly known as the star-tailed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a dense cluster of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Staphidium astrotrichum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
