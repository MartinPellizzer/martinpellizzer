<p>Sonchus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with serrated, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and roots make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
