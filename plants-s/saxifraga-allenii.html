<p>Saxifraga allenii, commonly known as Allen's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during the short growing season.</p>
<p>Saxifraga allenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
