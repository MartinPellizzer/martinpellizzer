                    <h1>Sequoia sempervirens var. nana-pendula</h1>
<p>Sequoia sempervirens var. nana-pendula, commonly known as the dwarf weeping coast redwood, is a unique variant of the coastal redwood.</p>
<p>It exhibits a compact growth habit with a slow growth rate, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. The plant features drooping, pendulous branches that give it a weeping appearance, contrasting with the upright form of typical coast redwoods. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves, typical of the coniferous species, and it produces small, inconspicuous cones.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, cool climates.</p>
