                <h1>Senega polygama</h1>
<p>Senega polygama, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-like flower that resembles a lady's slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in shaded environments. Senega polygama has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, and its unique floral structure plays a role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
