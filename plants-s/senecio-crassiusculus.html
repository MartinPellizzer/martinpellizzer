<p>Senecio crassiusculus, commonly known as the thickleaf groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent nature, it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
