                    <h1>Sceptridium minus</h1>
<p>Sceptridium minus, commonly known as the lesser tamarisk, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, woody stems, and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sceptridium minus is often found in washes, dunes, and other disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
