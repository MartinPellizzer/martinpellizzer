                    <h1>Sparganium simplex var. fluctuans</h1>
<p>Sparganium simplex var. fluctuans, commonly known as the floating burr rush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, spiky fruiting structures that resemble small, spiny balls, which help in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often submerged or floating at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
