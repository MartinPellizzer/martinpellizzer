                    <h1>Smilax grandis</h1>
<p>Smilax grandis, commonly known as the giant greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Smilax grandis thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth habit makes it both a valuable ecological component and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
