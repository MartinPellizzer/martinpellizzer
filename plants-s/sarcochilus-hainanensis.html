<p>Sarcochilus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan sarcocarp, is a terrestrial orchid native to China's Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb with a single, elongated leaf and produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. It blooms during the winter months, making it a rare and distinctive species within the Sarcochilus genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
