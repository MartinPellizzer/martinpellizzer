                    <h1>Salix helvetica var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Salix helvetica var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the European white willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lanceolate leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
