<p>Saxifraga kuana, commonly known as the Kuana saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
