<p>Sedum cilicicum, commonly known as Armenian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum cilicicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions.</p>
