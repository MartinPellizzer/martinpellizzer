<p>Smilax aculeata, commonly known as the catbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, stiff spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Smilax aculeata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
