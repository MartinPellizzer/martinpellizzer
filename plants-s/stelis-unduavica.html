                    <h1>Stelis unduavica</h1>
<p>Stelis unduavica, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis unduavica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat.</p>
