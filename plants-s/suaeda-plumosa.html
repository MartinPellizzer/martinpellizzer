<p>Suaeda plumosa, commonly known as the silky saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and desert regions.</p>
<p>Suaeda plumosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
