                    <h1>Stipagrostis obtusa</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis obtusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis obtusa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
