                    <h1>Stapelia arenosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia arenosa, commonly known as the desert stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its ability to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia arenosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
