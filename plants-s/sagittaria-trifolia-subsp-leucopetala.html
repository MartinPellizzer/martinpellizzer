<p>Sagittaria trifolia subsp.</p>
<p>leucopetala, commonly known as white arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically light green to white in color, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
