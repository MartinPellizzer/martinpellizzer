<p>Scutellaria sublitoralis, commonly known as the seaside skullcap, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Scutellaria sublitoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
