<p>Sayeria minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sayeria, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>

The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
