<p>Scutellaria viscidula, commonly known as sticky skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its sticky leaves and hairy stems are adaptations that help it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Scutellaria viscidula is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
