                    <h1>Stapelia cedrimontana</h1>
<p>Stapelia cedrimontana, commonly known as the Cape Town Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated by flies and beetles attracted by the scent.</p>
<p>Stapelia cedrimontana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
