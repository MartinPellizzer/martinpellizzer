                    <h1>Sophora pendula</h1>
<p>Sophora pendula, commonly known as the weeping senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>Sophora pendula is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
