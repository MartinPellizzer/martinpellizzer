<p>Smilax inermis, commonly known as the smooth smilax, is a vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and the absence of spines, which distinguishes it from other smilax species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its berries are dark red and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Smilax inermis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps.</p>
