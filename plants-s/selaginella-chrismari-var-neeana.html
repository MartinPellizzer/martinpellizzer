                    <h1>Selaginella chrismari var. neeana</h1>
<p>Selaginella chrismari var. neeana, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a rare and unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. This variety is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cellular structures.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying plant adaptations to environmental stress.</p>
