                    <h1>Sagittaria palifolia var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Sagittaria palifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Sagittaria palifolia, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. It produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
