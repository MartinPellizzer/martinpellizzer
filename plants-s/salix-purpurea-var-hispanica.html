<p>Salix purpurea var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses or in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects.</p>
