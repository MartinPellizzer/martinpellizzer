<p>Selenicereus dorschianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain numerous seeds. Its nocturnal flowering habit is an adaptation to attract pollinators such as bats and moths.</p>
<p>Selenicereus dorschianus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
