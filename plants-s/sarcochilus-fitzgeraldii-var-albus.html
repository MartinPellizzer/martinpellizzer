                    <h1>Sarcochilus fitzgeraldii var. albus</h1>
<p>Sarcochilus fitzgeraldii var. albus, commonly known as the White Fitzgerald's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
