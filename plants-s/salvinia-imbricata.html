                    <h1>Salvinia imbricata</h1>
<p>Salvinia imbricata, commonly known as the water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, overlapping leaves that help it stay afloat. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are responsible for its reproduction. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective colonizer of still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in non-native environments, posing challenges for aquatic ecosystems.</p>
