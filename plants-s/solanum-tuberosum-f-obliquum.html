The plant produces tubers that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to standard potatoes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its distinct morphology and potential for genetic research.</p>
