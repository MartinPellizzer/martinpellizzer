                    <h1>Statice caspia</h1>
<p>Statice caspia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>Statice caspia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
