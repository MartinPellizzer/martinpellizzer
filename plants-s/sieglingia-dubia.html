<p>Sieglingia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pale green to white and have a distinctive, almost spectral appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Sieglingia dubia is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
