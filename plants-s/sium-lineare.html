                    <h1>Sium lineare</h1>
<p>Sium lineare, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that grow on hollow, ridged stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of the parsnip.</p>
<p>Sium lineare thrives in wetlands and moist soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
