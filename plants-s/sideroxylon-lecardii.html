                    <h1>Sideroxylon lecardii</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon lecardii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, round fruits containing several seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon lecardii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert species.</p>
