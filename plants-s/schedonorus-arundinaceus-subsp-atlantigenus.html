<p>Schedonorus arundinaceus subsp.</p>
<p>atlantigenus, commonly known as the Atlantic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
