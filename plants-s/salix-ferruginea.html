                    <h1>Salix ferruginea</h1>
<p>Salix ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
