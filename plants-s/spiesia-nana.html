                    <h1>Spiesia nana</h1>
<p>Spiesia nana, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design.</p>
