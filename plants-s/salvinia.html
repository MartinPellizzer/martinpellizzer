                    <h1>Salvinia</h1>
<p>Salvinia, commonly known as watermoss, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves and spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Salvinia species are found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
<p>However, some species can become invasive, outcompeting native plants and altering water quality.</p>
