<p>Serapias lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the rockcress family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Serapias lutea is often found in open habitats such as limestone grasslands and coastal dunes.</p>
