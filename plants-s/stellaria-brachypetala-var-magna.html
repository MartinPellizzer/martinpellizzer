<p>Stellaria brachypetala var. magna, commonly known as the giant starwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
