<p>Spallanzania, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a unique liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, elliptical leaves that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Spallanzania reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Its simple yet efficient structure allows it to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of the bryophyte community.</p>
