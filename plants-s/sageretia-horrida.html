<p>Sageretia horrida, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sageretia horrida plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
