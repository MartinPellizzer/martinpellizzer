                    <h1>Spergularia doumerguei</h1>
<p>Spergularia doumerguei, commonly known as the Doumergue's sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent stems and fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in capsules that dehisce to release the seeds, facilitating dispersal in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Spergularia doumerguei is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with limited water availability.</p>
