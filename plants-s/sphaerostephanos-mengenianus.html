                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos mengenianus</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos mengenianus, commonly known as the Mengenianus starflower, is a rare and striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming dense tufts that help it withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
