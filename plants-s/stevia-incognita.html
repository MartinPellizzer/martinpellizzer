<p>Stevia incognita, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural sweetener, making it a popular alternative to sugar in many countries.</p>
<p>Stevia incognita is also valued for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
