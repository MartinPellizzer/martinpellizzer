                    <h1>Selaginella oligophylla</h1>
<p>Selaginella oligophylla, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. It produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of the stems, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Selaginella oligophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its unique adaptations to arid conditions.</p>
