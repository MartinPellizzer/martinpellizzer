<p>Saxifraga castellana, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Saxifraga castellana is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh environments, making it a common sight in rocky landscapes.</p>
