                    <h1>Sedum album f. virens</h1>
<p>Sedum album f. virens, commonly known as the green-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle contrast to its foliage. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'virens' distinguishes it from the typical white-flowered Sedum album by its unique greenish floral coloration.</p>
