                    <h1>Sulcorebutia gemmae</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia gemmae, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, ribbed stem with a dark green to bluish-gray coloration, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to form offsets, or "gemmae," which allow it to propagate vegetatively.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
