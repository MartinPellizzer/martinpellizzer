                    <h1>Salix humilis var. keweenawensis</h1>
<p>Salix humilis var. keweenawensis, commonly known as the Keweenaw willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and catkin flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family. This variety thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy areas. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it useful for erosion control in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to cold, moist environments in its native range.</p>
