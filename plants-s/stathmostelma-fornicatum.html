<p>Stathmostelma fornicatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped floral structure that protects its reproductive organs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hood-like bract. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
