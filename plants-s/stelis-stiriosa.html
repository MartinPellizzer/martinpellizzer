                    <h1>Stelis stiriosa</h1>
<p>Stelis stiriosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis stiriosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
