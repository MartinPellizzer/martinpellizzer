<p>Sorbus ursina, commonly known as the bear's berries, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5â€“9 pairs of leaflets, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Sorbus ursina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
