                    <h1>Scleroglossum koealagoguambaense</h1>
<p>Scleroglossum koealagoguambaense, commonly known as the Koealagoguamba sandstone lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Graphidaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure composed of a dense, crust-like layer. The lichen thrives on rocky substrates, particularly in areas with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. Its survival depends on the presence of specific mineral-rich soils and minimal competition from other flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
