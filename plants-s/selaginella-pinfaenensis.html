                    <h1>Selaginella pinfaenensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella pinfaenensis, commonly known as the pinfaenensis spikemoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common among spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary adaptations in early land plants.</p>
