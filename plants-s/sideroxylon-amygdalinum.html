                    <h1>Sideroxylon amygdalinum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon amygdalinum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
