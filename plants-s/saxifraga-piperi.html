<p>Saxifraga piperi, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga piperi is often found in mountain meadows and on rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
