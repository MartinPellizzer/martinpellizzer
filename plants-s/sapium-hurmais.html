<p>Sapium hurmais, commonly known as the narrowleaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
