<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions.</p>
