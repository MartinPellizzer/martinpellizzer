<p>Schismatoglottis beccariana var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leafed schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
