                    <h1>Shonia</h1>
<p>Shonia, commonly known as the Shonia lichen, is a type of symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its partners for nutrient absorption. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Shonia is often used in ecological studies to monitor environmental changes and air quality.</p>
