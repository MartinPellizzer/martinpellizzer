<p>Staphylea trifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered woodbine, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Staphyleaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, lemon-yellow berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
