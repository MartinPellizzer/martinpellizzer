                    <h1>Solanum tomentellum</h1>
<p>Solanum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike.</p>
