                    <h1>Sempervivum lautareticum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum lautareticum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Alps.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is often found growing in crevices and on stone surfaces, where it can tolerate harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
