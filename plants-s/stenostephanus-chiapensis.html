<p>Stenostephanus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or tree trunks. Its unique floral structure and limited geographic range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
