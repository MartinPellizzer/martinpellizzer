                    <h1>Senegalia sororia</h1>
<p>Senegalia sororia, commonly known as screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, often contorted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senegalia sororia is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
