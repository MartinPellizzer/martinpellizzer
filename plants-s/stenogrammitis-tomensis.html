                    <h1>Stenogrammitis tomensis</h1>
<p>Stenogrammitis tomensis, commonly known as the Tom's stenogrammitis, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
