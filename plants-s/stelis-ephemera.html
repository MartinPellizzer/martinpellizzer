                    <h1>Stelis ephemera</h1>
<p>Stelis ephemera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the dry season. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Stelis ephemera is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
