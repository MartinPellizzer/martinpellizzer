<p>Silene rupicola, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils, often on cliffs or among rocks. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Silene rupicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
