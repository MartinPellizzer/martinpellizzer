<p>Smilax herbacea var. foetida, commonly known as stinkbush or swamp smilax, is a perennial vine native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a climbing stem covered in sharp, curved spines and has opposite, arrowhead-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its roots are tuberous and used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
