                    <h1>Salicornia dioica</h1>
<p>Salicornia dioica, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its salt tolerance is due to specialized cellular structures that help regulate ion balance and prevent water loss.</p>
<p>Salicornia dioica plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
