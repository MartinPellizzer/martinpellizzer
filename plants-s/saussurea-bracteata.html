                    <h1>Saussurea bracteata</h1>
<p>Saussurea bracteata, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron or the Himalayan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in a composite head, which is a common feature among members of its family. Saussurea bracteata is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is not as widely used as other saffron species.</p>
