                    <h1>Salix tenerrima</h1>
<p>Salix tenerrima, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, delicate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions due to its aggressive spread.</p>
