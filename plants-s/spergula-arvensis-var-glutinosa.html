<p>Spergula arvensis var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky layer. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
