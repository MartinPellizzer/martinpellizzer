<p>Salix transarisanensis, commonly known as the Transarisan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it is often found in moist, forested habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
