                    <h1>Serapias lingua var. duriaei</h1>
<p>Serapias lingua var. duriaei, commonly known as the Duria's tongue orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, tongue-shaped lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
