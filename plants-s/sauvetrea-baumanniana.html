<p>Sauvetrea baumanniana, commonly known as the Baumann's sauvetrea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Sauvetrea baumanniana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments.</p>
