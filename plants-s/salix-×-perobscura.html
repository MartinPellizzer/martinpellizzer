                    <h1>Salix × perobscura</h1>
<p>Salix × perobscura, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix purpurea (purple willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive features. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a pale underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
