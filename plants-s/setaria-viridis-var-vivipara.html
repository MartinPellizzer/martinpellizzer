                    <h1>Setaria viridis var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Setaria viridis var. vivipara, commonly known as watergrass or viviparous green millet, is a variant of the green millet species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous offspring, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and rapid growth.</p>
