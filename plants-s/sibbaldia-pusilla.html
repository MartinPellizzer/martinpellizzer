<p>Sibbaldia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sibbaldia pusilla is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
