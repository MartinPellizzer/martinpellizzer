<p>Scorzoneroides montana subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
