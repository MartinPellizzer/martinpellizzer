<p>Saltugilia australis, commonly known as the Australian saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape. It is highly salt-tolerant, making it well-suited for saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Saltugilia australis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
