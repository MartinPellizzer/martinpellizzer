<p>Sorbus semipinnata eusemipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
