<p>Sagittaria multinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive network of veins. The plant produces small, white flowers that rise above the water surface in late summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sagittaria multinervia is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
