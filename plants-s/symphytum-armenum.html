                    <h1>Symphytum armenum</h1>
<p>Symphytum armenum, commonly known as Armenian comfrey, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It features rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of purple or pinkish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing allantoin, a compound known for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential toxicity, it is generally not recommended for cultivation in edible gardens.</p>
