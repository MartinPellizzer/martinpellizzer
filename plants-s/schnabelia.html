                    <h1>Schnabelia</h1>
<p>Schnabelia, commonly known as the snout vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, elongated seed pods that resemble a snout, giving the genus its common name. Schnabelia species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in dry, rocky soils or along roadsides. They produce small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and they are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardy nature.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Schnabelia annua and Schnabelia filiformis, which are both native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
