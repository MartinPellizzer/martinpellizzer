<p>Scirpus stans, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Scirpus stans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
