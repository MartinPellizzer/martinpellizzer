                    <h1>Sonchidium</h1>
<p>Sonchidium, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It typically features a rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into achene fruits, which are dispersed by wind. Sonchidium is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
