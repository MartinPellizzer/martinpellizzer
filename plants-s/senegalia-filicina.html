                    <h1>Senegalia filicina</h1>
<p>Senegalia filicina, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, silky appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Senegalia filicina is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
