                    <h1>Spergula pumila</h1>
<p>Spergula pumila, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Spergula pumila is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
