<p>Saxifraga yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against harsh weather.</p>
<p>Saxifraga yukonensis is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with long winters and short growing seasons.</p>
