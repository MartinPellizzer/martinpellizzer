                    <h1>Solanum adhaerens</h1>
<p>Solanum adhaerens, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
