                    <h1>Salacia kivuensis</h1>
<p>Salacia kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, simple leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salacia kivuensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
