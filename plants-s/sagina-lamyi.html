<p>Sagina lamyi, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Sagina lamyi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
