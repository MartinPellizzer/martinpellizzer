<p>Sabazia tridacoides, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity. It has adapted to harsh coastal conditions through specialized root systems and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Sabazia tridacoides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
