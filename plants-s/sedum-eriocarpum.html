<p>Sedum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense, white woolly coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at high altitudes or in tundra conditions.</p>
