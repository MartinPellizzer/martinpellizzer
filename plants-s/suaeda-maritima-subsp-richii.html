<p>Suaeda maritima subsp.</p>
<p>richii, commonly known as coastal seepweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
