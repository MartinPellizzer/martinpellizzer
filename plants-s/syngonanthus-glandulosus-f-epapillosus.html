                    <h1>Syngonanthus glandulosus f. epapillosus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus glandulosus f. epapillosus, commonly known as the papillate glandular everlasting pea, is a variant of the everlastings, characterized by its distinctive papillate (bump-like) glands on its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its foliage is often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it a rough texture and contribute to its adaptability in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
