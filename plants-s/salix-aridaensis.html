<p>Salix aridaensis, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, appearing in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Salix aridaensis is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
