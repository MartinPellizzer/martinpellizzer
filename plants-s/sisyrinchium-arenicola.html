<p>Sisyrinchium arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry habitats. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sisyrinchium arenicola plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
