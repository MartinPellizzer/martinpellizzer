                    <h1>Swainsona viridis</h1>
<p>Swainsona viridis, commonly known as the green swainsona, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often as a shrub or small tree. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
