                    <h1>Salix × lapponum</h1>
<p>Salix × lapponum, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a hybrid shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is well adapted to cold, harsh environments. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
