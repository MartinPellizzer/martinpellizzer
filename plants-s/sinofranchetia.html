                    <h1>Sinofranchetia</h1>
<p>Sinofranchetia, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or Chinese holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, and their showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Sinofranchetia species are often used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>They also play a role in traditional medicine in some regions of Asia.</p>
