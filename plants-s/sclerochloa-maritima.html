                    <h1>Sclerochloa maritima</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa maritima, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain tiny flowers typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh maritime conditions makes it a valuable plant for dune stabilization and ecological restoration.</p>
