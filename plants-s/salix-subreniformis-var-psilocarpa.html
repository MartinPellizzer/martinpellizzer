                    <h1>Salix subreniformis var. psilocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix subreniformis var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the hallucinogenic willow, is a rare variant of the willow tree native to parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with sub-reniform (kidney-shaped) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers, and its bark is typically grayish with a rough texture. While not a true hallucinogen, it has been associated with traditional use in certain regions for its potential psychoactive properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinct genetic variation and ecological niche within its native habitat.</p>
