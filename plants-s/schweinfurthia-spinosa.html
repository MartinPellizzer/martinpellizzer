<p>Schweinfurthia spinosa, commonly known as the snowbell or mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop.</p>
