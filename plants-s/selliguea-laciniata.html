                    <h1>Selliguea laciniata</h1>
<p>Selliguea laciniata, commonly known as the fringed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure with finely divided, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Selliguea laciniata is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually small and inconspicuous, with capsules that release spores for propagation.</p>
