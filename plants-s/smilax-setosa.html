<p>It features a woody stem covered with sharp, thorn-like projections, which help in climbing and defending against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, spiny berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Smilax setosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland areas.</p>
