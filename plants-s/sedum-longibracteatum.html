                    <h1>Sedum longibracteatum</h1>
<p>Sedum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out, covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sedum longibracteatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
