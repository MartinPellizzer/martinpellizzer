<p>Smilax pilosa, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>

The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Smilax pilosa is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
