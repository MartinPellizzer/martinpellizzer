                    <h1>Saxifraga ascoldica</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ascoldica, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the extreme conditions of mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga ascoldica is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in areas with limited vegetation.</p>
