<p>Solanum minutifoliolum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that mature to a deep purple color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
