                    <h1>Stipa iberica var. pseudodasyphylla</h1>
<p>Stipa iberica var. pseudodasyphylla, commonly known as the Iberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments.</p>
