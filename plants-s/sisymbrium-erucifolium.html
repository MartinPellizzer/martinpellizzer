                    <h1>Sisymbrium erucifolium</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium erucifolium, commonly known as hoary cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and roadsides. Its seeds are small and covered in a powdery coating, which aids in their dispersal.</p>
<p>Hoary cress is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
