<p>Sapium stylare, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red fruits that split open to reveal three winged seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
