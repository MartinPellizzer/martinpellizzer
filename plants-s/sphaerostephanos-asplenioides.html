                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos asplenioides</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos asplenioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
