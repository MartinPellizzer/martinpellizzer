                    <h1>Selago fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Selago fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to maritime environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, contributing to coastal habitat preservation.</p>
<p>Selago fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
