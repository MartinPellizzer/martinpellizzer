<p>Specklinia ruschii, commonly known as the silver-veined staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, antler-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its fronds are covered in a dense layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>Specklinia ruschii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
