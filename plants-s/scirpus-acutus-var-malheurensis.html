                    <h1>Scirpus acutus var. malheurensis</h1>
<p>Scirpus acutus var. malheurensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flowering spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically wind-pollinated, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
