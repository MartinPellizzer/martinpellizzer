                    <h1>Solanum poeppigianum var. crystallinum</h1>
<p>Solanum poeppigianum var. crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline nightshade, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue or black color. One of its most distinctive features is the presence of a crystalline substance on its leaves and stems, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This unique botanical trait makes it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study.</p>
