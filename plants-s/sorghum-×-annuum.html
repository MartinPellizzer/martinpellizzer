                    <h1>Sorghum × annuum</h1>
<p>Sorghum × annuum, commonly known as crossbred sorghum, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus).</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including robust growth habits and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant typically produces tall stalks with large, broad leaves, and its flowers are often composite inflorescences resembling those of sunflowers. Botanically, it is classified as an intergeneric hybrid, showcasing genetic diversity and potential for agricultural innovation.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest in research for its potential in biofuel production and as a model for studying plant hybridization.</p>
