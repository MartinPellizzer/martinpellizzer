<p>Saponaria fastigiata, commonly known as the upright soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which are natural detergents used historically for cleaning and medicinal purposes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>Saponaria fastigiata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
