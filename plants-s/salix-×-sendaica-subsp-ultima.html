<p>Salix × sendaica subsp.</p>
<p>ultima, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
