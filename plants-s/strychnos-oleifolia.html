                    <h1>Strychnos oleifolia</h1>
<p>Strychnos oleifolia, commonly known as the oil tree or African oil tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which are found in its seeds and roots.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a source of oil and in folk medicine.</p>
