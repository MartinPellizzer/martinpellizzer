<p>Selaginella darmandvillei var. busuensis, commonly known as the Busuensis spikemoss, is a rare and unique member of the Selaginellaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and spore-producing structures called strobila. Native to specific regions in Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, arranged in whorls around the stems.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
