                    <h1>Salix myrtillifolia var. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Salix myrtillifolia var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are male and female, and it thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in cold climates.</p>
