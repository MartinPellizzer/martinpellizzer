                    <h1>Salix teplouchowii</h1>
<p>Salix teplouchowii, commonly known as the Teplochowii willow, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many willow species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the willow family.</p>
