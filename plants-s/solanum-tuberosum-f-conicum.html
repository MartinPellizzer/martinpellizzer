                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. conicum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. conicum, commonly known as the conical potato, is a unique cultivar of the potato plant characterized by its distinctive conical shape.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits a compact growth habit with tubers that develop in a tightly clustered, cone-like formation. The foliage is typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is well-suited for smaller garden spaces. It is prized for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers, which have a slightly sweeter flavor compared to standard potatoes.</p>
<p>The conical form makes it an interesting choice for both culinary use and horticultural display.</p>
