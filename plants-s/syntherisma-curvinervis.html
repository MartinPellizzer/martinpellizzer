                    <h1>Syntherisma curvinervis</h1>
<p>Syntherisma curvinervis, commonly known as the curved-vein fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its intricate leaf structure.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that exhibit a distinctive, curved vein pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Syntherisma curvinervis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
