                    <h1>Stobaea bergii</h1>
<p>Stobaea bergii, commonly known as the Berg's stobaea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stobaea bergii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
