<p>Solanum proboluspermum, commonly known as the moonlit nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment.</p>
<p>Solanum proboluspermum is also notable for its toxic berries, which contain alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family.</p>
