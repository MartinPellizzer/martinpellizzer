                    <h1>Stipa arenicola</h1>
<p>Stipa arenicola, commonly known as the sand grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stipa arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
