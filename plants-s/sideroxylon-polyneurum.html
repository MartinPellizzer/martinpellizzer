<p>Sideroxylon polyneurum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carpentry and furniture-making.</p>
