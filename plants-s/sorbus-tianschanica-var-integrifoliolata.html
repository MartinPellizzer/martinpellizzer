<p>Sorbus tianschanica var. integrifoliolata, commonly known as the Tianshan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are entire or slightly lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, apple-like berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
