<p>Salix × eriocataphylla var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the red-osier dogwood, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive, bright red twigs that stand out against its green foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to North America, often found in wetlands and along stream banks where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind, followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
