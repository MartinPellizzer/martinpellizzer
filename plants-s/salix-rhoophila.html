                    <h1>Salix rhoophila</h1>
<p>Salix rhoophila, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the wetlands and streambanks of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones, contributing to erosion control and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Salix rhoophila is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
