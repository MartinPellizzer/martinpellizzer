<p>Setaria imberbis f. brevispica, commonly known as the short-haired barnyard grass, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced inflorescence.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to warm temperate and tropical regions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, flat leaves and a distinctive, sparsely branched panicle inflorescence. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Setaria imberbis.</p>
