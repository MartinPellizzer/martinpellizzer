<p>Sarcanthus fuscomaculatus, commonly known as the black-spotted hornwort, is a type of aquatic plant belonging to the family Anthocerotales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, filamentous structure and the presence of spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its dark green to blackish coloration is due to the presence of pigments like chlorophyll and carotenoids.</p>
<p>Sarcanthus fuscomaculatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
