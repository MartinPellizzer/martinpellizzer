<p>Suaeda pinnatifida, commonly known as sea spinach or saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid and coastal regions. The plant produces small, green to yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Suaeda pinnatifida is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline habitats across the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
