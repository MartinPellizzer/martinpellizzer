<p>Syngramma boerlageana, commonly known as the Boerlage's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance with elongated, spindly petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in semi-shade environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive, recurved lip that resembles a spider's body.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
