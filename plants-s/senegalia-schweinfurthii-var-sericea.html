<p>Senegalia schweinfurthii var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are often clustered in groups, adding ornamental value. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Silverleaf acacia is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
