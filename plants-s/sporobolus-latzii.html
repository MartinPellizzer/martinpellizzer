<p>Sporobolus latzii, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bract-like structures, which help in seed dispersal. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Sporobolus latzii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
