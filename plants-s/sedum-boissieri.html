                    <h1>Sedum boissieri</h1>
<p>Sedum boissieri, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sedum boissieri is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
