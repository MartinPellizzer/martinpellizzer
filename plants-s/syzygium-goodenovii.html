                    <h1>Syzygium goodenovii</h1>
<p>Syzygium goodenovii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, orange-red fruits. Syzygium goodenovii is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
