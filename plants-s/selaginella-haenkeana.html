                    <h1>Selaginella haenkeana</h1>
<p>Selaginella haenkeana, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many bryophytes and fern allies. Its reproductive structures are often clustered near the base of the plant, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Selaginella haenkeana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
