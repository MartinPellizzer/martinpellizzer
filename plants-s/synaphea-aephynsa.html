<p>Synaphea aephynsa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate rainforests of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that resemble the translucent, ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Synaphea aephynsa is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
