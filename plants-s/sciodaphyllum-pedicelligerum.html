<p>Sciodaphyllum pedicelligerum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often translucent fronds that give it a ghost-like appearance. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with spores produced in specialized cones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum pedicelligerum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
