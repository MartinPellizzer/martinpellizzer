<p>Saxifraga oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga oligophylla is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms dense mats that stabilize the soil.</p>
