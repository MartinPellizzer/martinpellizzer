<p>Sarracenia alabamensis subsp.</p>
<p>alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red, tubular pitchers that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils along the margins of bogs and swamps. Its leaves are modified into pitcher-shaped structures that serve as both traps and habitats for various small organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its relatively large size and vibrant coloration compared to other Sarracenia species.</p>
