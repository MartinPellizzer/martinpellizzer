                    <h1>Sedum ochroleucum var. anopetalum</h1>
<p>Sedum ochroleucum var. anopetalum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
