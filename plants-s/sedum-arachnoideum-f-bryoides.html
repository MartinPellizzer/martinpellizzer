<p>Sedum arachnoideum f. bryoides, commonly known as the "Cushion Stonecrop," is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and form a compact rosette, giving the plant a cushion-like appearance. It produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
