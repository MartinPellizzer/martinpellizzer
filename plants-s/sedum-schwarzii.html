                    <h1>Sedum schwarzii</h1>
<p>Sedum schwarzii, commonly known as the Blackfoot sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum schwarzii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including cold and arid environments.</p>
