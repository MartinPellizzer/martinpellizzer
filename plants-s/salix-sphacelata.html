                    <h1>Salix sphacelata</h1>
<p>Salix sphacelata, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Salix sphacelata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
