                            <h1>Senecio Nivalis</h1>
<p>Senecio nivalis, commonly known as the snowplant, is a rare and striking alpine species that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North America, where it flourishes in cold, rocky soils. This plant is notable for its bright white or pale green foliage, which resembles snow, hence its common name. Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably resilient, surviving harsh winter conditions. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and botanical admiration.</p>
