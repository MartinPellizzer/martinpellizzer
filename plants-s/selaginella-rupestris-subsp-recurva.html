<p>Selaginella rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>recurva, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of linear, glossy green leaves that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia in terminal clusters, which are released during dry periods to disperse spores. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to enter dormancy.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in its native ecosystems.</p>
