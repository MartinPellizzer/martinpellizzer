                    <h1>Selaginella yunnanensis var. longiflora</h1>
<p>Selaginella yunnanensis var. longiflora, commonly known as the Yunnan spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals around its stems, and it produces tiny, cone-like structures that contain spores. It is notable for its morphological similarity to other species in the genus Selaginella, which are often referred to as "spikemosses" due to their spiky appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential conservation significance.</p>
