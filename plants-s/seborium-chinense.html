                    <h1>Seborium chinense</h1>
<p>Seborium chinense, commonly known as the Chinese seborium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, oblong leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seborium chinense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
