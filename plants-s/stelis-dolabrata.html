                    <h1>Stelis dolabrata</h1>
<p>Stelis dolabrata, commonly known as the sickle orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, green leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive sickle-shaped lip that gives the species its common name.</p>
<p>Stelis dolabrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth.</p>
