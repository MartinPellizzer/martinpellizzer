<p>Senecio resedifolius var. columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
