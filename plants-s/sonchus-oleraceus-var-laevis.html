<p>Sonchus oleraceus var. laevis, commonly known as lettuceleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves that are often mistaken for lettuce, hence its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
