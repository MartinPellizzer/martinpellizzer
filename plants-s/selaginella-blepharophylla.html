<p>Selaginella blepharophylla, commonly known as the silver fir moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Selaginella blepharophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
