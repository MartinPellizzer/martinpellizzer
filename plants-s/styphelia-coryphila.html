<p>Styphelia coryphila, commonly known as the snowbells, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact and mat-like growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded borders.</p>
<p>Styphelia coryphila is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
