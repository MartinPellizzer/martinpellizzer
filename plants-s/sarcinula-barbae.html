                    <h1>Sarcinula barbae</h1>
<p>Sarcinula barbae, commonly known as the beard sponge, is a marine sponge found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sarcinulidae and is characterized by its dense, fibrous structure. The plant has a simple morphology with a spongy body composed of a network of cells called choanocytes. It lacks true roots, stems, or leaves, and instead relies on its porous structure for filtering water.</p>
<p>Sarcinula barbae plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
