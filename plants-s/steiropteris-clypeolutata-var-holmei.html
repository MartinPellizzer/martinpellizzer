<p>Steiropteris clypeolutata var. holmei, commonly known as the Holme's shield fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
