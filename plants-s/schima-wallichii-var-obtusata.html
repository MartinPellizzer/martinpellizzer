                    <h1>Schima wallichii var. obtusata</h1>
<p>Schima wallichii var. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved schima, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red drupes that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
