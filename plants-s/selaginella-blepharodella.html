                    <h1>Selaginella blepharodella</h1>
<p>Selaginella blepharodella, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often creeping stems that bear clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in low-light conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
