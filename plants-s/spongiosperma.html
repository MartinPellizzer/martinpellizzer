                    <h1>Spongiosperma</h1>
<p>Spongiosperma, commonly known as the spongy spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spongy, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Spongiosperma species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxic properties require caution in handling.</p>
