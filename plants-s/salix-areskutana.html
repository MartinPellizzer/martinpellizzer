<p>Salix areskutana, commonly known as the Areskutan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Salix areskutana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes.</p>
