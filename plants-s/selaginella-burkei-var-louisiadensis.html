                    <h1>Selaginella burkei var. louisiadensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella burkei var. louisiadensis, commonly known as the Lushan spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of needle-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats.</p>
