<p>Saxifraga stellaris subsp.</p>
<p>prolifera, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats, with small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons makes it a resilient and widespread species in its native environment.</p>
