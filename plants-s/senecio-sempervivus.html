                    <h1>Senecio sempervivus</h1>
<p>Senecio sempervivus, commonly known as the houseleek, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
