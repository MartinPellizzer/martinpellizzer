                    <h1>Salix philicifolia</h1>
<p>Salix philicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Salix philicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian habitats.</p>
