<p>Schizophragma hydrangeoides, commonly known as the climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble hydrangea flowers, though it is not related to the true hydrangea genus. The plant has opposite, simple, and lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries in the fall.</p>
<p>Schizophragma hydrangeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb walls or trellises.</p>
