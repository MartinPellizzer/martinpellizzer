                    <h1>Scirpus cernuus var. brevis</h1>
<p>Scirpus cernuus var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of Scirpus cernuus. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the water's edge.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and wetland organisms.</p>
