                    <h1>Smilax sagittata</h1>
<p>Smilax sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have a distinctive arrowhead shape, and its spiny stems that provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Smilax sagittata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps, often climbing or spreading along the ground.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a notable component of its native flora.</p>
