The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Salsola sieberi var. zygophylla is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and preventing erosion.</p>
