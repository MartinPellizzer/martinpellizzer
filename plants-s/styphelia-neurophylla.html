                <h1>Styphelia neurophylla</h1>
<p>Styphelia neurophylla, commonly known as the slender leaf wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are often accompanied by a strong, spicy scent. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Styphelia neurophylla is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
