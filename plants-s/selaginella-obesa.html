<p>Selaginella obesa, commonly known as the fat spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Selaginella obesa is valued for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance.</p>
