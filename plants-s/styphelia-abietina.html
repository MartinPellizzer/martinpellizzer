                    <h1>Styphelia abietina</h1>
<p>Styphelia abietina, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like, dark green, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat.</p>
<p>Styphelia abietina thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
