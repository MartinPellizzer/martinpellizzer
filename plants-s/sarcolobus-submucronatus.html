<p>Sarcolobus submucronatus, commonly known as the narrow-pointed lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale to dark green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga, which provides it with nutrients. It is often found on bark and rock surfaces in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
