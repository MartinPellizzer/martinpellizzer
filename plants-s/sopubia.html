                    <h1>Sopubia</h1>
<p>Sopubia, commonly known as the "cup-shaped plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like inflorescence that resembles a small bowl or cup, which is formed by the tightly packed ray florets. Sopubia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. The leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appearance.</p>
