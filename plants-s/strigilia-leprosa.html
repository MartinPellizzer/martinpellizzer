                    <h1>Strigilia leprosa</h1>
<p>Strigilia leprosa, commonly known as the leprous strigil, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with leprosy, though this connection is more cultural than botanical.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Strigilia leprosa is considered a delicate indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
