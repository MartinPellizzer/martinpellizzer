                    <h1>Sempervivum mettenianum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum mettenianum, commonly known as the hen-and-chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the Alps and Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ability to form offsets, or "chicks," allows it to propagate easily and maintain its compact, ornamental form.</p>
