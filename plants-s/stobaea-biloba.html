<p>Stobaea biloba, commonly known as the Biloba tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bilaterally symmetrical leaves, which are typically divided into two unequal lobes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Stobaea biloba is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
