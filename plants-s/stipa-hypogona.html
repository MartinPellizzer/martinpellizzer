                    <h1>Stipa hypogona</h1>
<p>Stipa hypogona, commonly known as the bentgrass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Stipa hypogona is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
