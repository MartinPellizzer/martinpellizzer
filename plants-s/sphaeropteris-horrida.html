<p>Sphaeropteris horrida, commonly known as the rough cycad, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
