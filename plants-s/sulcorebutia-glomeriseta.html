                    <h1>Sulcorebutia glomeriseta</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia glomeriseta, commonly known as the clustered cushion cactus, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with dense clusters of small, spiny stems that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia glomeriseta is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
