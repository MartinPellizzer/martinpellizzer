<p>Solanum horridum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple or black color. It has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which contribute to its prickly appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is considered somewhat invasive in some areas.</p>
