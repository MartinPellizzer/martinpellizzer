                    <h1>Sarothra aphylla</h1>
<p>Sarothra aphylla, commonly known as the hairless sandmat, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant lacks leaves, which is why it is called "aphylla," and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Sarothra aphylla is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
