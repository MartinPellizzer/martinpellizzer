<p>Salix leveilleana, commonly known as the Levill's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
