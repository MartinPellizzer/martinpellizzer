                    <h1>Sagitta graminea</h1>
<p>Sagitta graminea, commonly known as the arrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological success in these environments.</p>
<p>Sagitta graminea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
