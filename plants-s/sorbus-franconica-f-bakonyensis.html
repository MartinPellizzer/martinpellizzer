                    <h1>Sorbus franconica f. bakonyensis</h1>
<p>Sorbus franconica f. bakonyensis, commonly known as the Bakony whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European whitebeam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a notable subject in botanical studies.</p>
