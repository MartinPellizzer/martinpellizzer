<p>Spergula fimbriata var. tenuis, commonly known as slender fimbriate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of three to five spikelets, each with a distinct fringe of hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates.</p>
