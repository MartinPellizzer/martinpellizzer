                            <h1>Sporobolus Cuspidatus</h1>
<p>Needlegrass, scientifically known as Sporobolus cuspidatus, is a hardy perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its sharp, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit that makes it highly resilient to drought and heat. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in prairies, and in sandy or rocky habitats. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion has made it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects. Despite its tough appearance, Needlegrass plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>
