                    <h1>Sclerocactus wrightiae</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus wrightiae, commonly known as Wright's spiny cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, succulent body. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
