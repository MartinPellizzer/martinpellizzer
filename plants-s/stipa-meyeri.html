<p>Stipa meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-green foliage that produce delicate, feathery inflorescences in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Stipa meyeri is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
