                    <h1>Salvinia auriculata var. major</h1>
<p>Salvinia auriculata var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feathery leaves that allow it to absorb sunlight efficiently in water. The plant reproduces through spores and can spread rapidly, making it a potential invasive species in non-native environments. Its dense growth can alter water chemistry and outcompete native aquatic plants.</p>
<p>It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
