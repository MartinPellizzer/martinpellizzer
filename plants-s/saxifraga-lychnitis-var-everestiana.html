                    <h1>Saxifraga lychnitis var. everestiana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lychnitis var. everestiana, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming foliage composed of thick, waxy leaves that help conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is well-adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions.</p>
