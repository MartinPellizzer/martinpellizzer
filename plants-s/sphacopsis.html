                    <h1>Sphacopsis</h1>
<p>Sphacopsis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water flow and light absorption.</p>
<p>Sphacopsis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
