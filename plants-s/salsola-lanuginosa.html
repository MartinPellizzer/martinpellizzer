                    <h1>Salsola lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Salsola lanuginosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sandy soils. The plant has small, spiny leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Salsola lanuginosa is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
