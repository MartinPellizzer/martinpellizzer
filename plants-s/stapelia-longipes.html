<p>Stapelia longipes, commonly known as the longiped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Stapelia longipes is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
