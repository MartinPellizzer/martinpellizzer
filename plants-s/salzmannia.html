                    <h1>Salzmannia</h1>
<p>Salzmannia, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Salzmannia species are characterized by their showy, white or pale flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a glossy surface, and the fruits are fleshy berries containing seeds.</p>
<p>Despite their beauty, some species of Salzmannia contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
