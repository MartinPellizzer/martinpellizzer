<p>Sporobolus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across open grasslands.</p>
<p>Sporobolus welwitschii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of savanna ecosystems.</p>
