<p>Schwenckia juncoides, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is an aquatic or semi-aquatic species, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically whorled and have a spongy texture, which helps it absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Schwenckia juncoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
