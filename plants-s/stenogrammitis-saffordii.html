                    <h1>Stenogrammitis saffordii</h1>
<p>Stenogrammitis saffordii, commonly known as the Safford's stenogrammitis, is a rare fern native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
