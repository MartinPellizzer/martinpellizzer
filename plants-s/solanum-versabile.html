                    <h1>Solanum versabile</h1>
<p>Solanum versabile, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its variable morphology, which can lead to confusion with other solanum species. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and potential for hybridization, Solanum versabile is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
