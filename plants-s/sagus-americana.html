                    <h1>Sagus americana</h1>
<p>Sagus americana, commonly known as the American saguaro, is a unique cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 40 feet in height. The plant has a distinctive branching pattern, with arms that develop from the main stem as it matures. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by bats and insects.</p>
<p>The saguaro is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem to survive long dry periods.</p>
