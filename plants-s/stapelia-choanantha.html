<p>Stapelia choanantha, commonly known as the Cape Town stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia choanantha is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
