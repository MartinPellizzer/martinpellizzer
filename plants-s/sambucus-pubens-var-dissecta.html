<p>Sambucus pubens var. dissecta, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a reddish hue, especially in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the late summer. These berries are edible when fully ripe but are toxic when unripe and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest.</p>
