                            <h1>Sambucus Intermedia F. Neomexicana</h1>
<p>Sambucus intermedia f. neomexicana is a rare and lesser-known variant of the elderberry plant native to the southwestern United States. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive foliage and unique growth habits, making it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. While it shares some traits with its parent species, it exhibits notable differences in morphology and ecological adaptation. Due to its limited distribution, it faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes. Understanding and conserving this plant is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
