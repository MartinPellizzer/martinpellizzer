                    <h1>Sorghum vulgare var. nigricans</h1>
<p>Sorghum vulgare var. nigricans, commonly known as black sorghum, is a variety of sorghum characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a tall, robust grass native to Africa and widely cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to various climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are used for food, animal feed, and industrial purposes. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
<p>The plant's dark pigmentation is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value.</p>
