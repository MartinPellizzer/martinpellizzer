<p>Satyrium hallackii subsp.</p>
<p>ballii, commonly known as the Ball's ghost orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-white coloration.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested habitats. Its small, tubular flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
