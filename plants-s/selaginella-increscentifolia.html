                    <h1>Selaginella increscentifolia</h1>
<p>Selaginella increscentifolia, commonly known as the increasing frond spikeweed, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that grow in whorls around the stem. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without damage. Its reproductive structures, known as microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Selaginella increscentifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops.</p>
