<p>Selaginella schrammii, commonly known as Schramm's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Selaginella schrammii is adapted to drought conditions, with its ability to enter a state of dormancy during dry periods.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its native environment.</p>
