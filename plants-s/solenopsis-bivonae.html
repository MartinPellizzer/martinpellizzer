                    <h1>Solenopsis bivonae</h1>
<p>Solenopsis bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona fire ant, is a species of ant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, reddish-brown body and is closely related to other fire ant species. The plant aspect of this species refers to its role in the ecological interactions within its habitat, particularly in soil ecosystems. It is known to influence plant growth through both direct and indirect means, such as soil aeration and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>However, it is primarily recognized for its ant colony structure rather than botanical features.</p>
