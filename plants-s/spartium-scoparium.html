<p>Spartium scoparium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a bristly, spiky capsule, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Spartium scoparium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
