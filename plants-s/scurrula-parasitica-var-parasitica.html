                    <h1>Scurrula parasitica var. parasitica</h1>
<p>Scurrula parasitica var. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic scurrula, is a rare and specialized plant that exhibits hemiparasitic traits, drawing nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can access suitable host species. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, clustered leaves and a short, wiry stem. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
