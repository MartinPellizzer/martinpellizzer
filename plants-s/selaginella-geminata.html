                    <h1>Selaginella geminata</h1>
<p>Selaginella geminata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals around its stems.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of spore reproduction, with spores produced in specialized structures called strobila. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Selaginella geminata is also notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its capacity for desiccation tolerance.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important species in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
