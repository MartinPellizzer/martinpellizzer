<p>Statice × virgatoformis, commonly known as the common statice or sea lavender, is a flowering plant in the family Plumbaginaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean, it thrives in salty, well-drained soils. The plant is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin between two species of statice.</p>
