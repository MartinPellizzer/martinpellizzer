                            <h1>Sesleria Varia Var. Albicans</h1>
<p>Albicans sesleria, scientifically known as Sesleria varia var. albicans, is a striking grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale silver-blue foliage and delicate, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring. This variety is a lesser-known cousin of the more common Sesleria varia, often overlooked for its subtle beauty. Its unique coloration and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Despite its elegance, Albicans sesleria remains a relatively rare and underappreciated species in the botanical world.</p>
