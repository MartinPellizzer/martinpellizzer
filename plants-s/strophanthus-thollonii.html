<p>Strophanthus thollonii, commonly known as the red-stemmed African milkvine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds.
