                    <h1>Sticherus penniger</h1>
<p>Sticherus penniger, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, mat-forming evergreen moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, cup-like structures called gametophores, which bear the sex organs for reproduction. Sticherus penniger is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and on tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to retain moisture makes it an important component of soil stabilization and moisture regulation in its habitat.</p>
