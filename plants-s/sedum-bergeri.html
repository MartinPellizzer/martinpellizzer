<p>Sedum bergeri, commonly known as the Berger's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is typically low-growing, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Sedum bergeri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
