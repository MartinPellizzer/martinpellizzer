<p>Selinum polymorphum, commonly known as the mountain garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Selinum polymorphum is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
