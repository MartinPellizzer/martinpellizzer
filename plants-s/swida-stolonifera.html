<p>Swida stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale green berries that are often mistaken for true berries due to their appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Swida stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
