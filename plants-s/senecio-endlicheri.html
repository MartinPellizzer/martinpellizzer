<p>Senecio endlicheri, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and rockeries.</p>
