<p>Sagina pilifera var. laxa, commonly known as the lax sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
