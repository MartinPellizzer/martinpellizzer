                    <h1>Saxifraga bracteosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bracteosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bracteosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and tundra ecosystems.</p>
