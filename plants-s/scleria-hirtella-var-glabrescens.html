                    <h1>Scleria hirtella var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Scleria hirtella var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-headed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'glabrescens' refers to its smooth, hairless appearance compared to the typical form of S. hirtella.</p>
