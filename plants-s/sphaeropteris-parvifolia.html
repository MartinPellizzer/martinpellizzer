                    <h1>Sphaeropteris parvifolia</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
