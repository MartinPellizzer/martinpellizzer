<p>Specularia speculum-veneris f. procumbens, commonly known as the Venus' Looking-Glass trailing form, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period.</p>
