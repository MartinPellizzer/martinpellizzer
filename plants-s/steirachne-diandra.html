<p>Steirachne diandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a species of grass native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Steirachne diandra thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
