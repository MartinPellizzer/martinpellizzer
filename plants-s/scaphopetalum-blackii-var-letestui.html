<p>Scaphopetalum blackii var. letestui, commonly known as the blackii letestui variant, is a rare and unique species within the Scrophulariaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
