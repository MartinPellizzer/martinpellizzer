                    <h1>Strychnos fallax</h1>
<p>Strychnos fallax, commonly known as the African poison bean, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine despite their harmful effects. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure.</p>
<p>However, due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is highly poisonous and should be handled with care.</p>
