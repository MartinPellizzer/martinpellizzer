<p>Sedum crenulatum, commonly known as the stonecrop or silver leaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Sedum crenulatum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
