                    <h1>Sphenocentrum</h1>
<p>Sphenocentrum, commonly known as the African water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble the shape of a fern, with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and swamps. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Sphenocentrum plays a vital role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
