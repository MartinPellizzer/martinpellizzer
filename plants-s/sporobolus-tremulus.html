                    <h1>Sporobolus tremulus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus tremulus, commonly known as the trembling grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that often sway in the wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
