<p>Specklinia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's bryophyte, is a member of the family Ptychopteraceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic liverwort that typically grows on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like growth form with closely packed, overlapping leaves. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Specklinia curtisii is often found in shaded, moist environments, contributing to the biodiversity of forest understories.</p>
