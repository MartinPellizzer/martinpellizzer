                <h1>Salmonopuntia salmiana</h1>
<p>Salmonopuntia salmiana, commonly known as the golden fish spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green and spiny appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
