<p>Saccolabium heathii, commonly known as Heath's saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Saccolabium heathii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
