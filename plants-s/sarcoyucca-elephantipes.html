<p>Sarcoyucca elephantipes, commonly known as the elephant's foot yucca, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, elephant-like roots that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant features sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a unique visual contrast. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
