<p>Scirpus tenuis, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus tenuis is also an important food source for waterfowl and other wetland wildlife.</p>
