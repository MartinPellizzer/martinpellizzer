<p>Sarcopera tepuiensis subsp.</p>
<p>tepuiensis, commonly known as the Tepui sarcopera, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the tepuis, including high altitudes and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
