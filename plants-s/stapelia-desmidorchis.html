                    <h1>Stapelia desmidorchis</h1>
<p>Stapelia desmidorchis, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces distinctive yellow-orange flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Stapelia desmidorchis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
