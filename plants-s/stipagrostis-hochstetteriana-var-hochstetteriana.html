<p>Stipagrostis hochstetteriana var. hochstetteriana, commonly known as the Hochstetter's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
