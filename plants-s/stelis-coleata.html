<p>Stelis coleata, commonly known as the orchid with clustered flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, stocky stem with several clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Stelis coleata is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
