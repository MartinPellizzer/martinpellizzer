                    <h1>Serratula pinnatifida var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Serratula pinnatifida var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, hairless leaves and stems that are typically unbranched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
