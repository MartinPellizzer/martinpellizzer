                    <h1>Scleria depauperata</h1>
<p>Scleria depauperata, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Scleria depauperata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
