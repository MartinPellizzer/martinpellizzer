<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces feathery, bracted involucres that give it a delicate, airy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist meadows and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Silky goldenrod is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
