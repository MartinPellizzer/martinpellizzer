                    <h1>Sipanea pratensis f. breviflora</h1>
<p>Sipanea pratensis f. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered form of the meadow sipanea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more condensed inflorescences compared to the typical form. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a hairy surface that aids in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>
