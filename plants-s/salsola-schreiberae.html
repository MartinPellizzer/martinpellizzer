<p>Salsola schreiberae, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Salsola schreiberae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
