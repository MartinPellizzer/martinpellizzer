                    <h1>Stanhopea graveolens var. venusta</h1>
<p>Stanhopea graveolens var. venusta, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The variety venusta is distinguished by its more intense fragrance and slightly different flower morphology compared to the typical form.</p>
