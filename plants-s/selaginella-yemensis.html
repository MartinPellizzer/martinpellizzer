                    <h1>Selaginella yemensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella yemensis, commonly known as the Yemen spikemoss, is a rare and endemic vascular plant native to the highlands of Yemen.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobili. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to arid environments, with a succulent stem that helps store water. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella yemensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
