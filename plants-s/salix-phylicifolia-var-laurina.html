                    <h1>Salix phylicifolia var. laurina</h1>
<p>Salix phylicifolia var. laurina, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the willow family native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The bark is often reddish-brown and peels in thin layers, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
