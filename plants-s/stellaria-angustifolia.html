                    <h1>Stellaria angustifolia</h1>
<p>Stellaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals that bloom in clusters, often resembling a star, hence its genus name "Stellaria.". The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Stellaria angustifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations.</p>
