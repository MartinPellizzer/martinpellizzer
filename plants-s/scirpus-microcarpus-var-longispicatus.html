                    <h1>Scirpus microcarpus var. longispicatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus microcarpus var. longispicatus, commonly known as the long-spiked bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush genus Scirpus, native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The longispicatus variety is distinguished by its elongated, spiky inflorescences compared to other Scirpus species.</p>
