<p>Setaria maritima, commonly known as sea dropseed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it tolerate salt spray.</p>
<p>Setaria maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
