                    <h1>Setaria nana</h1>
<p>Setaria nana, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny seeds that are wind-dispersed, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its compact growth form and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
