<p>Sideroxylon pedicellatum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
