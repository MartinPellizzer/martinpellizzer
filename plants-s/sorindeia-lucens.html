                    <h1>Sorindeia lucens</h1>
<p>Sorindeia lucens, commonly known as the luminous sorindea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance that enhances its appeal to insects.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Sorindeia lucens is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
