<p>Sasaella iwatekensis f. yenaensis, commonly known as the Yenaensis form of the Iwatekensis sasa, is a variant of the sasa genus native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous stem system that aids in its clonal propagation.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
