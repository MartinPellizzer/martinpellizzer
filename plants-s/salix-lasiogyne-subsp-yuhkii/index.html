                            <h1>Salix Lasiogyne Subsp. Yuhkii</h1>
<p>Yuhkii willow, scientifically known as Salix lasiogyne subsp. yuhkii, is a rare and striking member of the willow family native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. This unique species is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, rounded leaves that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Yuhkii willow is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Its beauty and rarity make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
