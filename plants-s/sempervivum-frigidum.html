<p>Sempervivum frigidum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and is relatively easy to care for in gardens with low maintenance requirements.</p>
