<p>Sparganium draco, commonly known as the dragon burr, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, cone-like structures called spikelets, which are covered in bracts and contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in its preferred moist habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
