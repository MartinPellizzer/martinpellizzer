                    <h1>Schizoglossum biauriculatum</h1>
<p>Schizoglossum biauriculatum, commonly known as the two-auricle moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that often have distinct auricles, or ear-like structures, on both sides. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schizoglossum biauriculatum is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
