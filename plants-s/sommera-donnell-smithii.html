<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
