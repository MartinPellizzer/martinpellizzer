<p>Sparganium tenuicaule, commonly known as narrow-stem bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters.</p>
<p>It features narrow, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Sparganium tenuicaule is typically found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
