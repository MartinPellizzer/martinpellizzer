                    <h1>Sarcanthus uniflorus</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower sarcanthus, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in its natural habitat.</p>
