<p>Spiranthes pterygantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America.</p>

Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having linear, photosynthetic stems.</p>
<p>Spiranthes pterygantha is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
