<p>Salix myrsinites subsp.</p>
<p>breviserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
