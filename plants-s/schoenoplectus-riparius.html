<p>Schoenoplectus riparius, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of rivers, lakes, and ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers.
