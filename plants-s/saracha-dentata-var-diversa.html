<p>Saracha dentata var. diversa, commonly known as the variable toothed saracha, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and small, umbelliform flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. Its unique morphological variations make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant diversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
