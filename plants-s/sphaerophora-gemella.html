                    <h1>Sphaerophora gemella</h1>
<p>Sphaerophora gemella, commonly known as the gemella gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Sphaeroporidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily associated with the formation of galls on the leaves of various plants, particularly those in the genus *Quercus*. The female lays eggs on the underside of leaves, leading to the development of distinctive, spherical galls that provide protection for the developing larvae. These galls are often used as a food source by other insects and can influence the plant's growth patterns.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical interaction with Sphaerophora gemella highlights the complex relationships between insects and their host plants in ecological systems.</p>
