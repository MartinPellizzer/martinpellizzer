                    <h1>Schoenus macrocephalus</h1>
<p>Schoenus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus macrocephalus is also an important food source for various insects and waterfowl.</p>
