<p>Sedum reptans subsp.</p>
<p>carinatifolium, commonly known as the wrinkled stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that often lie prostrate, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pale pink to white, appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
