<p>Selaginella caulescens var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
