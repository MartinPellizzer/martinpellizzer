                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus var. cinereoviridis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. cinereoviridis, commonly known as the silver-green needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
