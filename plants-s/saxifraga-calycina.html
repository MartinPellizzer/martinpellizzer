                    <h1>Saxifraga calycina</h1>
<p>Saxifraga calycina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas where it forms dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga calycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
