                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus lanatus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, cushion-like growth.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish-green thallus with a velvety, woolly texture due to its dense growth of hyphae. The plant is characterized by its rounded, globe-shaped lobes that are often covered in a fine, downy layer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Sphaerocephalus lanatus is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
