                    <h1>Saussurea glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Saussurea glabriuscula, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in extreme altitudes with low oxygen levels. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
