<p>Steganthera brassii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Steganthera brassii is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
