<p>Salpixantha, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery绒毛, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Salpixantha is considered a botanical curiosity and is rarely studied.</p>
