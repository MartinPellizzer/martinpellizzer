<p>Saxifraga elata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Saxifraga elata is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
