                    <h1>Sphenostigma gracile</h1>
<p>Sphenostigma gracile, commonly known as the slender sphenostigma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that grow in a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and understudied species.</p>
