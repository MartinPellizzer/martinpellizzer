                <h1>Styphelia cinerea</h1>
<p>Styphelia cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects light and helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Styphelia cinerea thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
