                    <h1>Salvia kiaometiensis f. tomentella</h1>
<p>Salvia kiaometiensis f. tomentella, commonly known as the tomentellum sage, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers, typically arranged in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
