                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. caffrorum</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. caffrorum, commonly known as the Cape clubmoss, is a rare and endemic fern ally found primarily in South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping plant with a distinctive rosette of narrow, linear leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
