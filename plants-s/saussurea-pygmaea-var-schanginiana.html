<p>Saussurea pygmaea var. schanginiana, commonly known as the dwarf saussurea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold and dry conditions. The plant features a short, fibrous root system and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
