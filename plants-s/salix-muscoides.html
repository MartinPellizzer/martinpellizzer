<p>Salix muscoides, commonly known as the mossy willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing form, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, moss-like coating, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Salix muscoides thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
