<p>Sphaerorhizon, commonly known as the globe sphaerocarp, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Sphaerocarpaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where they form dense mats on the water surface. The genus is characterized by its unique, spherical or globular structure, which resembles a small ball. Sphaerorhizon species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
<p>They play a role in water filtration and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
