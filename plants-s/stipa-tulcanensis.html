<p>Stipa tulcanensis, commonly known as the Tulc√°n needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned spikelets. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
