                    <h1>Spiranthes olivacea</h1>
<p>Spiranthes olivacea, commonly known as the olive swamp twayblade, is a species of orchid native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with a slender, erect stem and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called bracts. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, giving the plant its characteristic name.</p>
