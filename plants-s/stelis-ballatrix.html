<p>Stelis ballatrix, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded forest habitat. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks, and it thrives in high light conditions with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Stelis ballatrix is a popular specimen in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and rarity in cultivation.</p>
