<p>Salvia albiterrarum, commonly known as the white sand sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Salvia albiterrarum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
