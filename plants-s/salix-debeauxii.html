                    <h1>Salix debeauxii</h1>
<p>Salix debeauxii, commonly known as the DeBeauvoir willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in alpine environments, characterized by its slender branches and narrow leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Salix debeauxii is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
