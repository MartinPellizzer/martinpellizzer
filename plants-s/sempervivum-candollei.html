                    <h1>Sempervivum candollei</h1>
<p>Sempervivum candollei, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, silver-tomentose leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, flowering stems with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Sempervivum candollei is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
