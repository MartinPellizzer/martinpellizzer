                    <h1>Suaeda maritima var. erecta</h1>
<p>Suaeda maritima var. erecta, commonly known as the erect sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, helping it survive in arid and salty conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round, red fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind or water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
