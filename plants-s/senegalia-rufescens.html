                    <h1>Senegalia rufescens</h1>
<p>Senegalia rufescens, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Its roots can fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil improvement in degraded lands.</p>
<p>Senegalia rufescens is also used traditionally for its wood, which is durable and resistant to termites.</p>
