                    <h1>Sempervivum tectorum var. arvernense</h1>
<p>Sempervivum tectorum var. arvernense, commonly known as the French stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
