                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum sonsonense</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum sonsonense, commonly known as the Sonsonense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Celtis*, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis. Its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky flowers are adaptations for attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Sciodaphyllum sonsonense plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting insect populations.</p>
