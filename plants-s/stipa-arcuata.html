                    <h1>Stipa arcuata</h1>
<p>Stipa arcuata, commonly known as the bentgrass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Stipa arcuata is valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
