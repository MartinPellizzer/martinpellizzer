                    <h1>Selaginella paxii var. subpedalis</h1>
<p>Selaginella paxii var. subpedalis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems. The plant produces sporophytes with spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its unique morphological features and is of interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance.</p>
