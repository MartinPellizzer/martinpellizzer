                    <h1>Scaevola tenera</h1>
<p>Scaevola tenera, commonly known as the coastal fairy fan, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal winds. Its flowers are usually pink or blue, with a distinctive fan-like shape that gives the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Scaevola tenera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
