<p>Scandicium stellatum, commonly known as the star-stemmed scandicium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that are often adorned with small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of mountain meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a protected species in several countries.</p>
