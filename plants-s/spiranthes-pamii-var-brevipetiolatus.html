<p>Spiranthes pamii var. brevipetiolatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with short petioles that distinguish it from other varieties.</p>
<p>It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
