<p>Stauracanthus genistoides subsp.</p>
<p>aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless broom, is a shrub native to certain parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates.</p>
