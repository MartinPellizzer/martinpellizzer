<p>Sphaerocionium urbani, commonly known as the urban bladdergrass, is a small annual plant native to regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, round, bladder-like fruits that contain the seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and urban environments, making it an adaptable species. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sphaerocionium urbani is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability.</p>
