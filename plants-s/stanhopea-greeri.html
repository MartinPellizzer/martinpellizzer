                    <h1>Stanhopea greeri</h1>
<p>Stanhopea greeri, commonly known as the Orange-veined Orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-pink flowers with dark veins, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stanhopea greeri is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
