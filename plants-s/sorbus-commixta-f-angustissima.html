                    <h1>Sorbus commixta f. angustissima</h1>
<p>Sorbus commixta f. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits known as pomes. It is native to specific regions in China and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
