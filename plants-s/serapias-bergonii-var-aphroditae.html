                    <h1>Serapias bergonii var. aphroditae</h1>
<p>Serapias bergonii var. aphroditae, commonly known as the Aphrodite's Serapias, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers with intricate patterns that resemble a face, giving it a striking and almost whimsical appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
