<p>Schwartzia pterosara, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
