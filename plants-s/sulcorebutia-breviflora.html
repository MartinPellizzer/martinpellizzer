                    <h1>Sulcorebutia breviflora</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sun rose, is a compact, mat-forming cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features pale green to bluish-gray stems that are ribbed and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
