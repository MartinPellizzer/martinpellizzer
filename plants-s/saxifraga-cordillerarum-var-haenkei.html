                    <h1>Saxifraga cordillerarum var. haenkei</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cordillerarum var. haenkei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are usually cordate, or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to high-altitude climates and is often found in meadows and on rock faces.</p>
