                    <h1>Sibbaldia procumbens var. aphanopetala</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia procumbens var. aphanopetala, commonly known as the small-flowered sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly substrates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, adapting to cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower size compared to the typical form of Sibbaldia procumbens.</p>
