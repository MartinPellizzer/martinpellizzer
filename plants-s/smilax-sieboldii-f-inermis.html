<p>Smilax sieboldii f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub characterized by its smooth, thornless stems, which distinguish it from other smilax species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
