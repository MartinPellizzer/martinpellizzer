                    <h1>Salix cordata var. typica</h1>
<p>Salix cordata var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
