<p>Sairocarpus vexillocalyculatus subsp.</p>
<p>vexillocalyculatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf saxifrage, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that provides insulation against harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous or arctic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually displaying shades of white or pale pink, and it blooms during the short summer season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
