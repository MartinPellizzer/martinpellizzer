<p>Salicaria alata, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pinkish flower spike that emerges from the water. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Salicaria alata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
