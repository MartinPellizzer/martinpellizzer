                    <h1>Solanum caldasii</h1>
<p>Solanum caldasii, commonly known as the Caldasii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum caldasii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
