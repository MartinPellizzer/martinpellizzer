The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
