<p>Stapelia glanduliflora var. haworthii, commonly known as the Haworth's Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
