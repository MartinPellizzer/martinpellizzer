<p>Salix drumensis, commonly known as Drummond's willow, is a species of shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats such as canyons and cliffs. It has adapted to arid conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Salix drumensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
