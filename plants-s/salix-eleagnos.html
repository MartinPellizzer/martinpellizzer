                    <h1>Salix eleagnos</h1>
<p>Salix eleagnos, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Salix eleagnos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system.</p>
