                    <h1>Saussurea brunneopilosa var. eopygmaea</h1>
<p>Saussurea brunneopilosa var. eopygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf safflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its fibrous root system is adapted for anchoring in rocky soils and absorbing nutrients from shallow layers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
