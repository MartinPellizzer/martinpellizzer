<p>Stapelia ciliolata, commonly known as the "Ciliate Stapelia," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia ciliolata is well-suited for rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
