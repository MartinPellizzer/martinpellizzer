                    <h1>Santalum freycinetianum var. auwahiense</h1>
<p>Santalum freycinetianum var. auwahiense, commonly known as the Auwahi sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a hemi-parasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree has a unique appearance, with a slender trunk and small, leathery leaves. Its fragrant wood has been historically valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
