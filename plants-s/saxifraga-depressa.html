<p>Saxifraga depressa, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Saxifraga depressa is often found in rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
