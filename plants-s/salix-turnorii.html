                    <h1>Salix turnorii</h1>
<p>Salix turnorii, commonly known as Turnor's willow, is a rare and woody shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside, and it produces small catkins during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix turnorii is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
