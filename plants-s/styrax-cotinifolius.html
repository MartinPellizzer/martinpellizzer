<p>Styrax cotinifolius, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn a striking shade of red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible for birds but generally not for humans.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique fruit display.</p>
