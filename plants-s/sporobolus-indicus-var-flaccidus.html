                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus var. flaccidus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. flaccidus, commonly known as the soft spikerush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry streambeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. flaccidus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
