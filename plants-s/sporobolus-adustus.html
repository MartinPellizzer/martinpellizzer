                    <h1>Sporobolus adustus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus adustus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Sporobolus adustus is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
