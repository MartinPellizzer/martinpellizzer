<p>Schiedea nuttallii, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Schiedea nuttallii thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakalā National Park, where it is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
