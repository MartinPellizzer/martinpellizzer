                    <h1>Santalodes simplicifolium</h1>
<p>Santalodes simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaf sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalales order.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots secrete chemicals that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it a competitive species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can be found in diverse habitats across Southeast Asia.</p>
