                    <h1>Salix atopantha</h1>
<p>Salix atopantha, commonly known as the high mountain willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Salix atopantha is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various pollinators and herbivores in its native range.</p>
