                    <h1>Suttonia volcanica var. lavarum</h1>
<p>Suttonia volcanica var. lavarum, commonly known as the lava rock plant, is a unique succulent native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant's stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warm season.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow in harsh, lava-derived soils makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
