                    <h1>Sedum wrightii var. priscum</h1>
<p>Sedum wrightii var. priscum, commonly known as the ancient stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It typically grows in open, sun-exposed areas and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>This variety is considered rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
