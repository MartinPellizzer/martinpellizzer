                    <h1>Salacistis elmeri</h1>
<p>Salacistis elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's salagrant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
