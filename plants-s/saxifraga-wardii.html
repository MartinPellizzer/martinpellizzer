<p>Saxifraga wardii, commonly known as the Ward's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
