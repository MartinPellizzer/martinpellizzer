                    <h1>Saxifraga ferruginea var. stellariformis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ferruginea var. stellariformis, commonly known as the star-shaped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, rusty-colored hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more elaborate floral structure compared to other members of the Saxifraga genus.</p>
