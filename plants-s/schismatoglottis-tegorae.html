<p>Schismatoglottis tegorae, commonly known as the Tegora's schismatoglottis, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea, it thrives in cool, humid environments with high altitude. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often in association with mosses and decomposing organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
