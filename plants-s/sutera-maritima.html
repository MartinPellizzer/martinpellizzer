                    <h1>Sutera maritima</h1>
<p>Sutera maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its structure helps it resist wind and salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh maritime environments.</p>
<p>Sutera maritima is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
