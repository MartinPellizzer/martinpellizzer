                    <h1>Salix crassa</h1>
<p>Salix crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and separate, small female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix crassa is valued for its rapid growth and ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
