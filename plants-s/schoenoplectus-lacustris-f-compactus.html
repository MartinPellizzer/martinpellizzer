<p>Schoenoplectus lacustris f. compactus, commonly known as the compact bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which forms thick mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
