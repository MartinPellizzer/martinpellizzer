<p>Schedonorus interruptus subsp.</p>
<p>corsicus, commonly known as Corsican bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal dunes and grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt and wind, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
