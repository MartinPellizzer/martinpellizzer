<p>Schaefferia serrata, commonly known as the serrated schaefferia, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Schaefferia serrata is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and being somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
