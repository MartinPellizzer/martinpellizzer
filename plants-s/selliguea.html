                    <h1>Selliguea</h1>
<p>Selliguea, commonly known as the rock liverwort, is a genus of moss-like plants belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or soil surfaces. They have a simple structure with leafy shoots and a distinct thallus that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Selliguea species are characterized by their small, closely packed leaves and their ability to thrive in humid, often nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them important indicators of environmental conditions in their ecosystems.</p>
