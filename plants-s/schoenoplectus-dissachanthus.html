                    <h1>Schoenoplectus dissachanthus</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus dissachanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus dissachanthus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
