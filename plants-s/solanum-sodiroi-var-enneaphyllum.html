                    <h1>Solanum sodiroi var. enneaphyllum</h1>
<p>Solanum sodiroi var. enneaphyllum, commonly known as the nine-leaf nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that often number nine on each stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Native to the Andean regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
