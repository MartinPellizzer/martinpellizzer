<p>Sciaphila brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed shadow plant, is a rare and delicate tropical epiphyte native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are pale greenish-white and are borne in clusters, adding a subtle elegance to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila brevipes is considered endangered and is difficult to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
