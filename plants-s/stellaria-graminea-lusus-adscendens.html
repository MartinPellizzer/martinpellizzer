<p>Stellaria graminea lusus adscendens, commonly known as the ascending starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, star-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It typically features opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom during the spring and early summer. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
