<p>Salix pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a fine, silky down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Salix pallasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
