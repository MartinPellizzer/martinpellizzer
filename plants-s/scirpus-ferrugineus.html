<p>Scirpus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish-brown tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in shallow water or damp soil.</p>
<p>Scirpus ferrugineus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
