<p>Salix repens var. nitida, commonly known as the silky willow or silver willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that are often covered with a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, silky texture, which contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other willow species but is distinguished by its unique silvery foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
