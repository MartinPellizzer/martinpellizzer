<p>Struthanthus glomeriflorus, commonly known as the clustered-flower struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Struthanthus glomeriflorus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
