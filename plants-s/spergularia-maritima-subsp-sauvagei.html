<p>Spergularia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>sauvagei, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
