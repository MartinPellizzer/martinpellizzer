                    <h1>Skapanthus oreophilus var. elongatus</h1>
<p>Skapanthus oreophilus var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated skapanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology makes it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
