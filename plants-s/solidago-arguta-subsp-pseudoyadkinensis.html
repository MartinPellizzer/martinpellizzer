<p>Solidago arguta subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoyadkinensis, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other solidago species, particularly in leaf and stem characteristics.</p>
