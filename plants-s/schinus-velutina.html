                    <h1>Schinus velutina</h1>
<p>Schinus velutina, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white, fragrant flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
