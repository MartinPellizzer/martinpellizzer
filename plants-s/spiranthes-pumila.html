<p>Spiranthes pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ladies' tresses, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences with tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
