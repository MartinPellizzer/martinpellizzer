<p>Saxifraga crustata, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, leafless stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga crustata is often found in mountainous areas and is a common component of alpine vegetation.</p>
