<p>Spiesia gebleri, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand.</p>

The plant belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically a silvery-gray color, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Spiesia gebleri is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its cultural significance to the MƒÅori people.</p>
