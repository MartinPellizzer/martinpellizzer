                    <h1>Sclerocactus parviflorus var. blessingiae</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus parviflorus var. blessingiae, commonly known as the Blessing's small-flowered spiny cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. This variant is characterized by its short, spiny stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
