<p>Sorbus semipinnata, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its bark is often reddish and peels in thin, papery layers, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Sorbus semipinnata is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
