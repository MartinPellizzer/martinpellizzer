                    <h1>Statice arabica</h1>
<p>Statice arabica, commonly known as desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally for their strong fibers, similar to flax.</p>
<p>Statice arabica plays a role in stabilizing soil in sandy environments and supports pollinators with its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
