                    <h1>Sphaerocionium × tucuchense</h1>
<p>Sphaerocionium × tucuchense, commonly known as the Tucuché hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Sphaerocionium hirsutum and Sphaerocionium tucuchense.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
