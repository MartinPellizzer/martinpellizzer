                    <h1>Styphelia longistylis</h1>
<p>Styphelia longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet heathlands of Tasmania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, acidic habitats.</p>
<p>Styphelia longistylis is an important component of Tasmania's unique flora and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
