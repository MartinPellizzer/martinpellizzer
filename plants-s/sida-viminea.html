                    <h1>Sida viminea</h1>
<p>Sida viminea, commonly known as creeping sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white to pale purple flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are ovate with hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Sida viminea is characterized by its fibrous, soft stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
