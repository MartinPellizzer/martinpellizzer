                    <h1>Solanum lobatum</h1>
<p>Solanum lobatum, commonly known as the lobed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves with lobed margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>While it has ornamental value, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
