                    <h1>Spiranthes australis var. suishaensis</h1>
<p>Spiranthes australis var. suishaensis, commonly known as the Suisha Ladies' Tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its population.</p>
