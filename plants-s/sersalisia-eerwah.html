<p>Sersalisia eerwah, commonly known as the moonlit fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires partial shade to prevent leaf scorch. Its roots are known to absorb minerals from the soil, contributing to the unique nutrient composition of the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
<p>Sersalisia eerwah is also noted for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over a century in optimal conditions.</p>
