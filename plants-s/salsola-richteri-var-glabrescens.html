                    <h1>Salsola richteri var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Salsola richteri var. glabrescens, commonly known as silver leaf saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glabrous, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Salsola richteri var. glabrescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
