                    <h1>Sadrum</h1>
<p>Sadrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble delicate glass, giving it a mystical appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its flowers emit a faint, ethereal glow at night, which has led to its association with folklore and the supernatural.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, the sadrum is relatively rare and often grows in secluded, undisturbed habitats.</p>
