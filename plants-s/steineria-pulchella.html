                    <h1>Steineria pulchella</h1>
<p>Steineria pulchella, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique visual element to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Steineria pulchella is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
