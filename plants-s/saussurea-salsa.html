<p>Saussurea salsa, commonly known as the desert gentian, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppes and deserts.</p>
<p>Saussurea salsa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
