<p>Schoepfia elliptica, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it well adapted to drought and poor soil, and it is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant also serves as a host for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
