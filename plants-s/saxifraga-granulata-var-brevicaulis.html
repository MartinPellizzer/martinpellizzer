                    <h1>Saxifraga granulata var. brevicaulis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga granulata var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact rosettes of hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in inflorescences at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
