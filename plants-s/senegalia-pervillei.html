                    <h1>Senegalia pervillei</h1>
<p>Senegalia pervillei, commonly known as the Perville acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in hot climates. The plant produces yellow, fluffy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Senegalia pervillei is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
