<p>Sedum aestivum, commonly known as summer sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance.</p>
<p>Sedum aestivum thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
