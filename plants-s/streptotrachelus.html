                    <h1>Streptotrachelus</h1>
<p>Streptotrachelus, commonly known as the black carpet beetle, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Dermestidae.</p>
<p>These small, dark-colored insects are often found in environments with decaying organic matter, such as dead wood or animal remains. The larvae of Streptotrachelus are known for their ability to feed on keratin, a protein found in hair, feathers, and horns. They play a role in breaking down organic material in ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, some species can become pests by damaging stored products or museum collections.</p>
