<p>Sticherus farinosus, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant forms a thin, powdery coating that can appear as a pale to dark brown layer on surfaces. Its thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner.</p>
<p>This lichen is well adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
