<p>Sciaphila pilulifera, commonly known as the pill-shaped moss orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique morphology includes a short, pill-like stem, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
