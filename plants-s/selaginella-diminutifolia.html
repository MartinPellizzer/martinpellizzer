                    <h1>Selaginella diminutifolia</h1>
<p>Selaginella diminutifolia, commonly known as the "dwarf spikemoss," is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, scale-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, which are produced in tiny, cone-like structures called strobila.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in horticultural displays.</p>
