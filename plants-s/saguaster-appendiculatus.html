<p>Saguaster appendiculatus, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Saguaster appendiculatus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
