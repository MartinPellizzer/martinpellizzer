<p>Stylidium bulbiferum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant burr-stick, is a unique Australian plant characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, bulb-like structures that resemble small, inflated capsules.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is native to arid regions of Western Australia. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can go dormant during periods of drought.</p>
