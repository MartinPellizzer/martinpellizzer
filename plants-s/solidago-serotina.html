<p>Solidago serotina, commonly known as late goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Late goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly in the fall when other nectar sources are scarce.</p>
