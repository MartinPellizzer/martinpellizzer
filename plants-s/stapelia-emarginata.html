                    <h1>Stapelia emarginata</h1>
<p>Stapelia emarginata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, odorless flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>Stapelia emarginata is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
