<p>Stenosiphonium, commonly known as the narrow-siphon plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a slightly hairy texture. Native to regions of southern Africa, Stenosiphonium species are often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
