                    <h1>Sarracenia flava var. minima</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava var. minima, commonly known as the small yellow pitcher plant, is a variant of the yellow pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, narrow pitchers that are typically yellowish-green in color. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using its modified leaves, which form a pitfall trap. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its small size and striking color make it a popular choice for bog gardens and carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
