                    <h1>Stelis vulgaris</h1>
<p>Stelis vulgaris, commonly known as the common stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Stelis vulgaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
