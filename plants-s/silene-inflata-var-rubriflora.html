                    <h1>Silene inflata var. rubriflora</h1>
<p>Silene inflata var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in water retention, a feature typical of the Silene genus. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
