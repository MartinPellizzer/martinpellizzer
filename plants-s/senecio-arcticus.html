                    <h1>Senecio arcticus</h1>
<p>Senecio arcticus, commonly known as Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Senecio arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
