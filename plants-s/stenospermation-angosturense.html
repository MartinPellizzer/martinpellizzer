                    <h1>Stenospermation angosturense</h1>
<p>Stenospermation angosturense, commonly known as the narrow-seed orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces small, elongated seeds enclosed in a thin, fibrous capsule, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
