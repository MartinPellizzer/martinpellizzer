                    <h1>Stapelia hirsuta var. longirostris</h1>
<p>Stapelia hirsuta var. longirostris, commonly known as the Long-beaked Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are typically yellow with red markings, resembling the face of a cow. These flowers open in the evening and emit a strong odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
