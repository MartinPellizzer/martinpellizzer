                    <h1>Salix macrosperma</h1>
<p>Salix macrosperma, commonly known as the giant willow or the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and long, pendulous branches that often droop toward the ground. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-white underside, which gives the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins rather than showy flowers, and its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks.</p>
