                    <h1>Siphonia rigidifolia</h1>
<p>Siphonia rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid frond siphonia, is a marine red alga characterized by its robust, calcified thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, rocky coastal areas where it attaches to substrates such as stones or shells. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with thick, rigid branches that provide structural support. Its reproductive structures, called conceptacles, are embedded within the thallus and produce both male and female gametes.</p>
<p>Siphonia rigidifolia plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
