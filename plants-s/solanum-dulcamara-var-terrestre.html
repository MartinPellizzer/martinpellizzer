<p>Solanum dulcamara var. terrestre, commonly known as woody nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with stems that can become woody over time. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by berries that turn from green to red or yellow as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids such as solanine and scopolamine.</p>
