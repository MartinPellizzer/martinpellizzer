<p>Sagittaria pusilla, commonly known as the small arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to the health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sagittaria pusilla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse aquatic conditions.</p>
