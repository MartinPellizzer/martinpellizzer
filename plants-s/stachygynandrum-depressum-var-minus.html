                    <h1>Stachygynandrum depressum var. minus</h1>
<p>Stachygynandrum depressum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf marsh hibiscus, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features small, showy flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with five petals and a prominent yellow center. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sunny to partially shaded conditions. It is commonly found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Stachygynandrum depressum, making it well-suited for smaller garden spaces or as a ground cover in wetland gardens.</p>
