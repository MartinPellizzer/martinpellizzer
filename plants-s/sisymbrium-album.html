<p>Sisymbrium album, commonly known as white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
