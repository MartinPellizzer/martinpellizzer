                    <h1>Selaginella caudata</h1>
<p>Selaginella caudata, commonly known as the trailing spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with upright, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Selaginella caudata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy.</p>
<p>This adaptability makes it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
