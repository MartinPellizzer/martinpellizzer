                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. peruviana</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its unique morphology and adaptation to high-altitude conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
