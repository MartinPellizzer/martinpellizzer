<p>Sempervivum × funkii, commonly known as the Firecrest, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth pattern. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette in late summer.</p>
<p>Sempervivum × funkii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
