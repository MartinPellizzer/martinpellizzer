<p>Succisa procera, commonly known as the mountain lion's tail, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Succisa procera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
