                    <h1>Saxifraga asarifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga asarifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Saxifraga asarifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
