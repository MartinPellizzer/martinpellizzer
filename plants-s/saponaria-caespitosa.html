<p>Saponaria caespitosa, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Saponaria caespitosa is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from its saponin content.</p>
