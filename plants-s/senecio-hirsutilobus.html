                    <h1>Senecio hirsutilobus</h1>
<p>Senecio hirsutilobus, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
