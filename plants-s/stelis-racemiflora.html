                    <h1>Stelis racemiflora</h1>
<p>Stelis racemiflora, commonly known as the racemiflora orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a raceme, which is a type of inflorescence. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis racemiflora is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
