<p>Sorbus purpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf sorbus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its attractive, ornamental foliage, which turns a striking purple or reddish hue in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of bright red berries that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and greyish, with a tendency to flake in older specimens.</p>
<p>Sorbus purpurea is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological value, providing food for birds and insects.</p>
