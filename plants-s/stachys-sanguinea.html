<p>Stachys sanguinea, commonly known as red deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and reddish veins, and it produces spikes of pale purple to pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its lack of true leaves, as its foliage is reduced to bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Stachys sanguinea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
