<p>Senecio profundorum, commonly known as the deep valley groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Senecio profundorum produces yellow flowers in late summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for local pollinators.</p>
