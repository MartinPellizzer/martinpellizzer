                    <h1>Somphoxylon deminutum</h1>
<p>Somphoxylon deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf sandbur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, spherical seed pods that mature into spiny structures, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically yellow or green, and appear in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Somphoxylon deminutum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides forage for certain wildlife species.</p>
