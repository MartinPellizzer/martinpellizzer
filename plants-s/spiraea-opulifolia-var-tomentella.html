                    <h1>Spiraea opulifolia var. tomentella</h1>
<p>Spiraea opulifolia var. tomentella, commonly known as the silver-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its clusters of white, cone-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in gardens as a foundation plant or border.</p>
<p>The varietal form tomentella is distinguished by its particularly dense, fuzzy leaves, which give it a unique textural appearance.</p>
