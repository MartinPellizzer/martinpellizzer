                    <h1>Selaginella dregei var. pretoriensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella dregei var. pretoriensis, commonly known as the Pretoria spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
