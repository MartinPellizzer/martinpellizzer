                    <h1>Stemodiacra ericifolia</h1>
<p>Stemodiacra ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact form and specialized adaptations make it a resilient species in extreme climates.</p>
