                    <h1>Salix ludoviciana</h1>
<p>Salix ludoviciana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties, particularly for their salicin content, similar to that found in willow bark.</p>
