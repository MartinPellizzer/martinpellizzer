<p>Siderodendron triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Siderodendron triflorum also has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
