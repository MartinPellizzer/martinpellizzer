<p>Salix × patula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grey, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>
