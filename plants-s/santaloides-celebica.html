                    <h1>Santaloides celebica</h1>
<p>Santaloides celebica, commonly known as the Celebes sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic shrub that lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its woody roots are highly valued for their aromatic resin. Santaloides celebica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by forming symbiotic relationships with various tree species.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, its conservation status remains critically threatened.</p>
