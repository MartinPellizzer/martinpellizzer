<p>Spaniopappus bucheri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Spaniopappus bucheri is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
