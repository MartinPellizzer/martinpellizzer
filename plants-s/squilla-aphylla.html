                <h1>Squilla aphylla</h1>
<p>Squilla aphylla, commonly known as the leafless squilla, is a unique member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a short, fleshy stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a striking, trumpet-shaped form.</p>
<p>Despite its simple appearance, Squilla aphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
