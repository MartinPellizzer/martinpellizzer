<p>Schollera reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf or reniform plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are kidney-shaped, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
