                    <h1>Sarracenia calceolata</h1>
<p>Sarracenia calceolata, commonly known as the pink spathed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped pitchers that are often tinged with pink or red hues. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized traps that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to break down prey. Sarracenia calceolata thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and bright light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
