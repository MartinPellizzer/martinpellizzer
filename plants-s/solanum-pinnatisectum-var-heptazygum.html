<p>Solanum pinnatisectum var. heptazygum, commonly known as the seven-lobed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for cultivation or consumption.</p>
