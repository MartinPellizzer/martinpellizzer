<p>Senecio villiferus, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Senecio villiferus is typically found in rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
