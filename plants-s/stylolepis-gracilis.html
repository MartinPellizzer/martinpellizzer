<p>[WRONG START] Styrolepis gracilis, commonly known as the slender lepidote fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lepidopteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Stylolepis gracilis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
