<p>Schoenus paniculatus, commonly known as the swamp grass or panicled sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in other moist habitats, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. The plant features triangular stems with a distinct central vein, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy surface. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, branched cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Schoenus paniculatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
