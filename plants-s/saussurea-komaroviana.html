<p>Saussurea komaroviana, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
