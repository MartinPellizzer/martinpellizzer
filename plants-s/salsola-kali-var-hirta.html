                    <h1>Salsola kali var. hirta</h1>
<p>Salsola kali var. hirta, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a perennial plant native to the steppes of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical use as forage for livestock, though it is more frequently recognized for its invasive tendencies.</p>
