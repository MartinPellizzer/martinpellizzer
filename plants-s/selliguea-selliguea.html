<p>Selliguea selliguea, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leafy thallus is usually green or yellowish, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Selliguea selliguea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its natural ecosystem.</p>
