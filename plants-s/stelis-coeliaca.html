                    <h1>Stelis coeliaca</h1>
<p>Stelis coeliaca, commonly known as the sky orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in shaded, humid environments where it relies on specific epiphytic conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires careful cultivation to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Stelis coeliaca is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
