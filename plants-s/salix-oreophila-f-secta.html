                    <h1>Salix oreophila f. secta</h1>
<p>Salix oreophila f. secta, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring form of Salix oreophila, characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced foliage. The plant exhibits unique morphological traits such as shortened stems and dense, hairy leaves, which help it withstand harsh mountain conditions. It typically grows in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters, often in alpine meadows or on slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
