<p>Sesuvium portulacastrum, commonly known as carpetweed, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it a common species in coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
