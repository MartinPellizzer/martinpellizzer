                    <h1>Senecio rauchii</h1>
<p>Senecio rauchii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's groundsel, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid regions as a low-maintenance plant.</p>
