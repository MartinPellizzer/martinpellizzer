                    <h1>Senegalia parviceps</h1>
<p>Senegalia parviceps, commonly known as the burro bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. Its seed pods are woody and contain several small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Senegalia parviceps plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
