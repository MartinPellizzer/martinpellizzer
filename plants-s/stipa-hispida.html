                    <h1>Stipa hispida</h1>
<p>Stipa hispida, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, compact growth habit, often forming tussocks. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet, bearing small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>Stipa hispida is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common component of steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
