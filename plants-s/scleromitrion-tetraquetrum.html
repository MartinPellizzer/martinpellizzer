<p>Scleromitrion tetraquetrum, commonly known as the four-ribbed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage.</p>
<p>The species is known for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
