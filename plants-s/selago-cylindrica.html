                    <h1>Selago cylindrica</h1>
<p>Selago cylindrica, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, succulent stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Selago cylindrica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
