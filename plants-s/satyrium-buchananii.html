<p>Satyrium buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it an attractive subject for both horticultural cultivation and botanical study.</p>
