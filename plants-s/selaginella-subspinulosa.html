                    <h1>Selaginella subspinulosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella subspinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose spikemoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its primitive evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
