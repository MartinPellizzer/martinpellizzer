<p>Albiflora sage, scientifically known as Salvia canariensis f. albiflora, is a rare and striking variant of the common sage plant native to the Canary Islands. This unique cultivar is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers that contrast beautifully with its deep green foliage. While it shares many traits with its parent species, it exhibits a more compact growth habit and a more refined appearance, making it a sought-after ornamental plant. Due to its limited natural range and delicate nature, Albiflora sage is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its genetic integrity. Its beauty and rarity make it a fascinating subject for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
