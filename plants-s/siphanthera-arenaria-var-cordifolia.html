                    <h1>Siphanthera arenaria var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Siphanthera arenaria var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf sandplant, is a rare and specialized succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
