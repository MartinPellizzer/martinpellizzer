                    <h1>Striga parviflora</h1>
<p>Striga parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other vegetation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. It is native to various parts of Africa and is considered a weed that can significantly reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, controlling Striga parviflora is a major challenge in agricultural systems.</p>
