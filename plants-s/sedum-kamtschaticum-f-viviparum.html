                    <h1>Sedum kamtschaticum f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Sedum kamtschaticum f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in late summer. One of its notable features is its viviparous nature, where it gives birth to live young rather than producing seeds.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive method makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
