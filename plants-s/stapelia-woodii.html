<p>Stapelia woodii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decay. These flowers bloom in the early morning and remain open for only a few days.</p>
<p>Stapelia woodii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xerophytic gardens.</p>
