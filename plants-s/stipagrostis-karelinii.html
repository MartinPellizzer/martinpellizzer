<p>Stipagrostis karelinii, commonly known as the Karelin's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis karelinii plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
