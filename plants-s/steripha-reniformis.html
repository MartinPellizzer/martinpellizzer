                    <h1>Steripha reniformis</h1>
<p>Steripha reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea lettuce, is a green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that grows in dense mats on rocky substrates in marine environments. The plant has a distinct reniform (kidney-shaped) morphology, with a broad, undulating structure that allows it to float or adhere to surfaces. It contains chlorophyll a and c, enabling it to perform photosynthesis in coastal waters.</p>
<p>Steripha reniformis plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
