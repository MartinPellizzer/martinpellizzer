                    <h1>Salix × relicta</h1>
<p>Salix × relicta, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix babylonica, characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a graceful appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small catkins in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
