                    <h1>Scilla barberi</h1>
<p>Scilla barberi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round, blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Scilla barberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It is also a subject of botanical interest due to its unique adaptations to its alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
