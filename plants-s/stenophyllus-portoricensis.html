                    <h1>Stenophyllus portoricensis</h1>
<p>Stenophyllus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the forests of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that typically grow in dense, shaded environments. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies.</p>
