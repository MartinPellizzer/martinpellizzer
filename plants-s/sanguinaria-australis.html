<p>Sanguinaria australis, commonly known as the Australian bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sanguinaria australis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the reddish sap that exudes from its stems when broken, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities.</p>
