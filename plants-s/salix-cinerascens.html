<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Salix cinerascens thrives in moist, often riparian habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
