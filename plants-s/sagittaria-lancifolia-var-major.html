                    <h1>Sagittaria lancifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Sagittaria lancifolia var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, marshes, and wetlands, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, with a prominent midrib, and produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and improving water quality.</p>
