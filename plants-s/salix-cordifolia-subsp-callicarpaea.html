<p>Salix cordifolia subsp.</p>
<p>callicarpaea, commonly known as the red willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, often riparian habitats and is adapted to the cooler, mountainous environments of its range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
