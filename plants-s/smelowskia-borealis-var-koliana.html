                    <h1>Smelowskia borealis var. koliana</h1>
<p>Smelowskia borealis var. koliana, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high Arctic regions of northern Canada and Greenland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Its leaves are typically hairy and narrow, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species plays a minor but important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators in its brief flowering season.</p>
