                    <h1>Selaginella speluncae var. effugita</h1>
<p>Selaginella speluncae var. effugita, commonly known as the cave spikemoss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant adapted to life in dark, humid cave environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and short, strobilus-bearing stems. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, shaded conditions, often growing on rock surfaces or in soil within limestone caves. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal in low-light, high-humidity microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for cave ecosystems.</p>
