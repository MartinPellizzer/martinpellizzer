                    <h1>Stipa trochlearis</h1>
<p>Stipa trochlearis, commonly known as the mountain grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa trochlearis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
