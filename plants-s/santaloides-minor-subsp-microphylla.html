<p>Santaloides minor subsp.</p>
<p>microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in nutrient cycling.</p>
