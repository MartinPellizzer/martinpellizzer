<p>Socotrella dolichocnema, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically Socotra Island.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often gnarled trunk, which can grow up to 15 meters tall. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, forming a dense, conical crown. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
