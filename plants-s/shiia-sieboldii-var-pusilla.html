                    <h1>Shiia sieboldii var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Shiia sieboldii var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf shiia, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
