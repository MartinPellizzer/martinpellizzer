<p>Spitzelia saharae, commonly known as the Saharan spitzelia, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spitzelia saharae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in desert ecosystems.</p>
