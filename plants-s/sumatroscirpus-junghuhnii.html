<p>Sumatroscirpus junghuhnii, commonly known as the Java water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring warm and humid conditions. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring itself to submerged objects.</p>
<p>Sumatroscirpus junghuhnii plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
