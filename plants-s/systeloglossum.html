                    <h1>Systeloglossum</h1>
<p>Systeloglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals that are often fused into a hood-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Systeloglossum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
