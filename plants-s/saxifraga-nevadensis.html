                    <h1>Saxifraga nevadensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found in snowbanks and on exposed slopes. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are pink or white, appearing in early spring before the snow has fully melted.</p>
<p>Saxifraga nevadensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its rugged habitat and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, high-altitude conditions.</p>
