                    <h1>Staurogyne ranaiensis</h1>
<p>Staurogyne ranaiensis, commonly known as the Malayan water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has a rosette-like structure with broad, waxy, oval leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters near the water surface. Staurogyne ranaiensis is adapted to slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
