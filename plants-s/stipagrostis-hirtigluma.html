                    <h1>Stipagrostis hirtigluma</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis hirtigluma, commonly known as the hairy steppegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaf blades that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to colonize disturbed soils and stabilize sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis hirtigluma is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it an important component of grassland ecosystems in its native range.</p>
