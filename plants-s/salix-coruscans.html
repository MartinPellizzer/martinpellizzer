                    <h1>Salix coruscans</h1>
<p>Salix coruscans, commonly known as the glittering willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
