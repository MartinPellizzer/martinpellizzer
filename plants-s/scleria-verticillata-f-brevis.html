                    <h1>Scleria verticillata f. brevis</h1>
<p>Scleria verticillata f. brevis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulrush, is a variant of the broad-leaf bulrush, characterized by its shorter, more compact leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. The plant features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist or aquatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
