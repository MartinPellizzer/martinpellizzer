                    <h1>Sclerochloa woronowii</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa woronowii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica, giving them a sharp, needle-like appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa woronowii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in degraded or disturbed landscapes.</p>
