                    <h1>Scirpus tenuifolius</h1>
<p>Scirpus tenuifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus tenuifolius is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source for certain wildlife species.</p>
