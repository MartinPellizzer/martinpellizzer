<p>Schoenus subflavus, commonly known as the golden bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically golden or reddish in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Schoenus subflavus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>
