<p>Sedum tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
