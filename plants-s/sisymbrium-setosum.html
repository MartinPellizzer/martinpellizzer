<p>Sisymbrium setosum, commonly known as hoary crowsfoot, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces slender, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium setosum is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
