<p>Scleria capillaris, commonly known as the slender swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
