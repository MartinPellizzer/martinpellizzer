                    <h1>Setaria stolonifera</h1>
<p>Setaria stolonifera, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance lawns and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and sustainable landscaping practices.</p>
