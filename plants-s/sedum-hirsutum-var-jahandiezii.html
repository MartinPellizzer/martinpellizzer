                    <h1>Sedum hirsutum var. jahandiezii</h1>
<p>Sedum hirsutum var. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Desert Sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. Its stems are often hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
