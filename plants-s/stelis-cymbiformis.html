                    <h1>Stelis cymbiformis</h1>
<p>Stelis cymbiformis, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Stelis cymbiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
