<p>Sagittaria trachysepala, commonly known as the rough arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it its common name. Its small white flowers appear in clusters above the water, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
