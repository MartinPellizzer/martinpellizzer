                    <h1>Salsola vermiculata var. villosa</h1>
<p>Salsola vermiculata var. villosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with densely packed, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry, coastal or desert regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
