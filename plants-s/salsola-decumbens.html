                <h1>Salsola decumbens</h1>
<p>Salsola decumbens, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and saline areas. The plant has succulent, prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Salsola decumbens is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and widespread species in desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
