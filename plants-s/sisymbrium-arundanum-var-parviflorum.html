                    <h1>Sisymbrium arundanum var. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium arundanum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its yellow or greenish flowers and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions of Europe and Asia. It has a short life cycle and produces a large number of small seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
