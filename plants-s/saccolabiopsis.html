<p>Saccolabiopsis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Saccolabiopsis species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions, often having succulent stems and leaves to store water.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Saccolabiopsis curvifolia and Saccolabiopsis staminea, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats.</p>
