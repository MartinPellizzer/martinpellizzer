<p>Subularia aquatica f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water lettuce, is a variant of the water lettuce species native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are elongated compared to the typical form, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a soft, spongy texture and is often found in still or slow-moving waters. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it float and retain moisture.</p>
<p>This aquatic plant plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
