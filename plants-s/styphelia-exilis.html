<p>It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form, helping it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Styphelia exilis is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
