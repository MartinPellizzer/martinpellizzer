<p>Sphaerophysa salsula, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry soils.</p>
<p>Sphaerophysa salsula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
