<p>Saxifraga bronchialis subsp.</p>
<p>compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, cushion-like clusters of foliage, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
