                    <h1>Selago capitata</h1>
<p>Selago capitata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, grass-like bracts. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Selago capitata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
