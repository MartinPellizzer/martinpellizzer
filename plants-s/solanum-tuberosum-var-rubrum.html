<p>This variety belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, producing tubers that are harvested for culinary use. Its botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and small white flowers that develop into berries.</p>
