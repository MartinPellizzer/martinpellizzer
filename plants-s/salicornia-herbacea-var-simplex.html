                    <h1>Salicornia herbacea var. simplex</h1>
<p>Salicornia herbacea var. simplex, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to accumulate salt makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
