                    <h1>Salix torreyana</h1>
<p>Salix torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix torreyana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
