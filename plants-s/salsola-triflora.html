<p>Salsola triflora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salsola triflora is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in sandy soils.</p>
