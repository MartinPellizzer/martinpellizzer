The plant is adapted to rocky, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
