                    <h1>Selaginella calcarea</h1>
<p>Selaginella calcarea, commonly known as the limestone spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils. The plant has creeping stems that produce upright, spore-bearing leaves, which are typically narrow and linear. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Selaginella calcarea is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of rocky and limestone habitats.</p>
