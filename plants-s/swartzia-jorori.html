                    <h1>Swartzia jorori</h1>
<p>Swartzia jorori, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Swartzia jorori is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
