                    <h1>Siphocampylus corymbiflorus</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus corymbiflorus, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>
