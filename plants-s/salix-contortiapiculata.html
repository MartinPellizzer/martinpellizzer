<p>Salix contortiapiculata, commonly known as the twisted dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has narrow, twisted branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
