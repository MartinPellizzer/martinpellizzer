                    <h1>Scirpus × triquetriformis</h1>
<p>Scirpus × triquetriformis, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that belongs to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Scirpus maritimus and Scirpus tabernaemontani, characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in brackish or freshwater marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its rhizomes help in nutrient cycling and can tolerate varying salinity levels, making it adaptable to different wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scirpus × triquetriformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats.</p>
