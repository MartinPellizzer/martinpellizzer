<p>Stipa joannis subsp.</p>
<p>sabulosa, commonly known as the sand grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
