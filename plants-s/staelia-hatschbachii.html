<p>Staelia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>Staelia hatschbachii is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive.</p>
