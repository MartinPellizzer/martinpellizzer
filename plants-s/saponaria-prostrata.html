<p>Saponaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the entire plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>Saponaria prostrata is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and full sun conditions.</p>
