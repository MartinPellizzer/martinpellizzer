The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
