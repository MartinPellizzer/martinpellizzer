<p>Stanhopea wardii, commonly known as the Ward's stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Stanhopea wardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure.</p>
