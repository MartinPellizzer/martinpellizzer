                    <h1>Spicanta unilateralis</h1>
<p>Spicanta unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided thornweed, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its asymmetrical growth pattern.</p>
<p>It features a single, elongated stem with lateral branches that develop only on one side, creating an unusual visual structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pale yellow and white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged spirally along the stem.</p>
<p>Native to arid regions, Spicanta unilateralis has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
