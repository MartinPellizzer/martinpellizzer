                    <h1>Salvia pitcheri</h1>
<p>Salvia pitcheri, commonly known as the Michigan pitcher plant, is a striking perennial herb native to the Great Lakes region of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vivid violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows. Its unique structure, with tubular flowers that resemble pitchers, aids in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several states.</p>
