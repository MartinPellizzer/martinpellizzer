                    <h1>Stelis galapagosensis</h1>
<p>Stelis galapagosensis, commonly known as the Galápagos stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of the islands, often found on trees and rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in the region.</p>
