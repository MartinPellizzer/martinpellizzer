<p>Stelis expansa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, branched stem and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with white to pale yellow petals. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Stelis expansa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
