                    <h1>Scirpidium sulcatum var. lituratum</h1>
<p>Scirpidium sulcatum var. lituratum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds that create a lacy appearance, with a light green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'lituratum' is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure compared to the typical variety.</p>
