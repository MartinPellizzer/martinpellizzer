                            <h1>Solidago Serotina Var. Gigantea</h1>
<p>Solidago serotina var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant late goldenrod, is a striking member of the aster family that thrives in moist, open habitats across eastern North America. This tall, robust plant can reach heights of up to six feet, making it one of the most visually imposing wildflowers in its native range. Its bright yellow inflorescences bloom late in the season, providing crucial nectar sources for pollinators when other flowers have faded. Despite its showy appearance, it is often overlooked in favor of more commonly cultivated goldenrods. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
