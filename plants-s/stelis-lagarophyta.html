<p>Stelis lagarophyta, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Stelis lagarophyta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
