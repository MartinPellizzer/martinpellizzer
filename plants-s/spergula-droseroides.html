                    <h1>Spergula droseroides</h1>
<p>Spergula droseroides, commonly known as the dewy willow or the sticky willow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance. These hairs are believed to aid in the capture of small insects, contributing to the plant's nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Spergula droseroides is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
