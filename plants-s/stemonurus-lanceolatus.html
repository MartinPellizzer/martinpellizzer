                    <h1>Stemonurus lanceolatus</h1>
<p>Stemonurus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
