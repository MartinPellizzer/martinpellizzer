<p>Sagina subulata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the mossy pearlwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features tiny, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
