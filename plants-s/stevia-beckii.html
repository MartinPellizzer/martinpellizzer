<p>Stevia beckii, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural, calorie-free sweetener in various foods and beverages.</p>
<p>Stevia beckii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation.</p>
