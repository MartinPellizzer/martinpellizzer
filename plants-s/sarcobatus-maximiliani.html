<p>Sarcobatus maximiliani, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and has deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Sarcobatus maximiliani plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
