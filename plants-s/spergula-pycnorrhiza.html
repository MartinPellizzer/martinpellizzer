                    <h1>Spergula pycnorrhiza</h1>
<p>Spergula pycnorrhiza, commonly known as the dense-rooted wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its dense root system, it is sometimes used for erosion control in disturbed soils.</p>
