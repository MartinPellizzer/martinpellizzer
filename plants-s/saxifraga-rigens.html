<p>Saxifraga rigens, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, cushion-like growth with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or reddish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Saxifraga rigens is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in cold climates.</p>
