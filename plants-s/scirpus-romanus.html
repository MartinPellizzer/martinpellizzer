                    <h1>Scirpus romanus</h1>
<p>Scirpus romanus, commonly known as the Roman bulrush, is a tall, aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus romanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and prevent erosion.</p>
