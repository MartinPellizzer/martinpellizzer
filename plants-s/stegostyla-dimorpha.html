<p>Stegostyla dimorpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures are concealed within small, spore-bearing capsules that develop on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Stegostyla dimorpha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
