                    <h1>Strychnos monosperma</h1>
<p>Strychnos monosperma, commonly known as the African bitter apple, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that contain a single seed, hence its specific epithet *monosperma*. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if mishandled.</p>
