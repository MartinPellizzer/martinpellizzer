<p>Smilax roxburghiana, commonly known as the Indian arrowroot or yellow smilax, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, thorned stems and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including moist and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright yellow berries, which are a source of food for various wildlife species. Smilax roxburghiana is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive plant in its native habitat.</p>
