The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
