<p>Saponaria bodeana, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or magenta flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Saponaria bodeana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the saponins present in its leaves, which produce a soapy lather when crushed.</p>
