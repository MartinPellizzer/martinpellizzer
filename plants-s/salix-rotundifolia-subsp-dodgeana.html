<p>Salix rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>dodgeana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its rounded, often hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in wet, boggy environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its flexible stems and compact growth habit make it well-suited for erosion control in moist soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and specific leaf morphology compared to other willow species.</p>
