<p>Scirpus gaudichaudii, commonly known as the giant bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to the eastern Pacific coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense stands in brackish or freshwater marshes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or reddish in color, and it blooms from summer to early fall. Scirpus gaudichaudii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are also used in traditional ecological knowledge for basket-making and other crafts.</p>
