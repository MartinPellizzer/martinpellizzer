                    <h1>Salicornia heterantha</h1>
<p>Salicornia heterantha, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often red or pink in color, which help in reducing water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female reproductive structures on the same plant. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Salicornia heterantha plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
