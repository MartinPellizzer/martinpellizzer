<p>Saxifraga rosacea subsp.</p>
<p>rosacea, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
