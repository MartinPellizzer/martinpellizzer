                    <h1>Sedum ciliosum</h1>
<p>Sedum ciliosum, commonly known as the wooly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
