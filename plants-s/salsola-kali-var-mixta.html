                    <h1>Salsola kali var. mixta</h1>
<p>Salsola kali var. mixta, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in disturbed soils. It thrives in a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize degraded areas make it a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
