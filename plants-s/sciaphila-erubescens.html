                    <h1>Sciaphila erubescens</h1>
<p>Sciaphila erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers, which bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
