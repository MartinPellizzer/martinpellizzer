<p>Salix pseudowallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
