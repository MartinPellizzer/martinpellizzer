<p>Scirpus etuberculatus, commonly known as the tuberculate bulrush, is a tall, emergent wetland plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct tuberculate (knobbed) texture on the surface.</p>
<p>Scirpus etuberculatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species.</p>
