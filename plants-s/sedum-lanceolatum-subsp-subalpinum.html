<p>Sedum lanceolatum subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedum, is a perennial succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive.</p>
