<p>Saxifraga luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color, which help it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat.

It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
