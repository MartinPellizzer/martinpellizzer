<p>Salix alaternoides, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources.</p>
