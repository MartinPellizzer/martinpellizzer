                    <h1>Sprucea</h1>
<p>Sprucea, commonly known as the common spruce, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae.</p>
<p>These trees are characterized by their cone-shaped crowns, needle-like leaves, and distinctive, woody cones that contain seeds. Sprucea species are typically found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in well-drained soils and cooler climates. They play an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>The wood of sprucea is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for construction and paper production.</p>
