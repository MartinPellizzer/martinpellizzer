<p>Savia volubilis, commonly known as the climbing bittersweet, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces bright orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded locations and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
