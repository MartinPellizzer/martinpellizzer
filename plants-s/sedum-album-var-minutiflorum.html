                    <h1>Sedum album var. minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Sedum album var. minutiflorum, commonly known as the silverleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design.</p>
