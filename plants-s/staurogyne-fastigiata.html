                    <h1>Staurogyne fastigiata</h1>
<p>Staurogyne fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Staurogyne fastigiata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
