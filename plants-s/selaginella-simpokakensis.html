                    <h1>Selaginella simpokakensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella simpokakensis, commonly known as the Kankens Island spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiky leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. This plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a trait common among early land plants. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to arid conditions, with specialized structures for water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant evolution and conservation.</p>
