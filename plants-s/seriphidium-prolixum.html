<p>Seriphidium prolixum, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
