<p>Setaria viridis var. minor, commonly known as green foxtail, is a grass species native to Africa and widely cultivated as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual plant that typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that form dense, green clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth and high biomass production, making it suitable for various agricultural and ecological applications. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its genetic simplicity and adaptability have made it a valuable resource for studying plant genetics and responses to environmental stress.</p>
