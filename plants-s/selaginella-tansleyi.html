                    <h1>Selaginella tansleyi</h1>
<p>Selaginella tansleyi, commonly known as the Tansley's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in rocky soils and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. The plant produces microspores and megaspores in cones, which are typical of its evolutionary adaptation to dry environments.</p>
<p>Its morphological features make it an important subject in the study of plant resilience and adaptation strategies.</p>
