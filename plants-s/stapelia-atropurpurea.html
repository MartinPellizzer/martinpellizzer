<p>Stapelia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple star stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically purple or reddish in color. Its leaves are usually small and often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia atropurpurea is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
