                    <h1>Selaginella gypsophila</h1>
<p>Selaginella gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Selaginella gypsophila is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its ability to retain water in its tissues.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
