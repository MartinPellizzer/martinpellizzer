                    <h1>Saguerus westerhoutii</h1>
<p>Saguerus westerhoutii, commonly known as the Westerhout's saguaro, is a rare and unique cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble the more well-known saguaro cactus, Saguarus arizonica. The plant has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring. It is adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Saguerus westerhoutii is considered an endangered species.</p>
