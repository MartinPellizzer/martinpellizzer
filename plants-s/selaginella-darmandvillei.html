                    <h1>Selaginella darmandvillei</h1>
<p>Selaginella darmandvillei, commonly known as the Darmandville spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's spores. Native to the humid, shaded environments of southeastern China, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant's ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it an important component of understory ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
