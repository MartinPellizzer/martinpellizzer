<p>Steriphoma paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallales order.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a fleshy, egg-shaped base and a spore-bearing cap that resembles a phallus. The fungus is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies and other insects for spore dispersal. It typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves the production of spores through a specialized structure called a gleba.</p>
