<p>Solanum ariduphilum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species.</p>
<p>Solanum ariduphilum plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
