<p>Selaginella pulvinata subsp.</p>
<p>pulvinata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
