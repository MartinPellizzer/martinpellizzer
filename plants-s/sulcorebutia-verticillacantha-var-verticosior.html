<p>Sulcorebutia verticillacantha var. verticosior, commonly known as the tall-stemmed crassula, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or silver hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained soil make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its taller stem and more elongated leaves compared to other Sulcorebutia species.</p>
