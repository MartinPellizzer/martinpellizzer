<p>Squamopappus skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's squamopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, scale-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and yellow, contributing to its role as a nectar source for local pollinators.</p>
