                    <h1>Spathium echinatum</h1>
<p>Spathium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny spathium, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which is known for its modified leaves called spathes that enclose the true flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in high moisture conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are small and clustered, are pollinated primarily by insects, making it an important part of the ecosystem's pollination network.</p>
