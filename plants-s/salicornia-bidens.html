<p>Salicornia bidens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species that thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has jointed, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt crystals, which help in excreting excess salt. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or reddish and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Salicornia bidens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
