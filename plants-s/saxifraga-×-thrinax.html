                    <h1>Saxifraga × thrinax</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × thrinax, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, usually blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover.</p>
