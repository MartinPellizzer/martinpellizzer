                    <h1>Strobilanthes refracta</h1>
<p>Strobilanthes refracta, commonly known as the "Ghost Orchid," is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Strobilanthes refracta is considered a conservation concern.</p>
