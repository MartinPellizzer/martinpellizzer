                    <h1>Sarracenia purpurea var. sanguinea</h1>
<p>Sarracenia purpurea var. sanguinea, commonly known as the crimson swamp lantern, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep red to orange-red pitchers, which are often adorned with a distinctive white or yellow stripe. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using its modified leaves, which function as pitfall traps. The pitchers are typically narrow and elongated, with a narrow neck that helps prevent the escape of captured prey.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey to supplement its nutritional needs.</p>
