                    <h1>Sphaerotylos medogensis</h1>
<p>Sphaerotylos medogensis, commonly known as the Medog globe lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive spherical thallus structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is notable for its compact, globular growth form, which provides it with a unique appearance among lichens. The organism is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, typically a member of the Ascomycota. It is primarily found in high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Sphaerotylos medogensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
