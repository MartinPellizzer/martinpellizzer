<p>Synadenium arborescens, commonly known as the desert candle or the candle plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling candles, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
