                    <h1>Stelis minima</h1>
<p>Stelis minima, commonly known as the miniature stelis orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a compact, slender stem with few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections.</p>
