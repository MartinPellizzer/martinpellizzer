<p>Sesleria caerulea subsp.</p>
<p>uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wet habitats in Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to purple flower spikes in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in damp, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a clumping form that makes it suitable for wetland gardens.</p>
