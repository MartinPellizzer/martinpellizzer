                    <h1>Salsola sabrinae</h1>
<p>Salsola sabrinae, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and disturbed soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spiny heads, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Salsola sabrinae is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
