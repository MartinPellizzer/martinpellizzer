<p>Spatularia newcombei, commonly known as the Newcomb's spatula lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a broad, spatula-shaped lobes.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth, leathery texture. It reproduces through the release of soredia, which are small, powdery structures containing both algae and fungal cells.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
