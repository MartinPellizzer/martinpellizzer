<p>Sillaphyton podagraria, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright orange berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid spread, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
