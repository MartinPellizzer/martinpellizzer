<p>Salicornia dolichostachya subsp.</p>
<p>strictissima, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
