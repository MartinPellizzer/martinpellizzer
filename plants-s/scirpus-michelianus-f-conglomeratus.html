<p>Scirpus michelianus f. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern, which distinguishes it from other forms of Scirpus. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are typically borne in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This form is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other freshwater wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
