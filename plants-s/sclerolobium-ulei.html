                    <h1>Sclerolobium ulei</h1>
<p>Sclerolobium ulei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it plays an important ecological role in its native region.</p>
