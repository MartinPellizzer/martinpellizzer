<p>Syrmatium procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate syrmatium, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Syrmatium procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
