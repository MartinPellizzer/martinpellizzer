<p>Solanum flexicaule, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which help it thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are usually yellow or orange, are toxic and should not be consumed.</p>
<p>Solanum flexicaule is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
