                    <h1>Sparganium microcarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium microcarpum, commonly known as the lesser bur-reed, is a water-loving plant native to wetlands and shallow lakes in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that emerge from the water's surface, supporting narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spiky, brownish flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which are often referred to as "burrs.". Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with the seeds enclosed in spiny cases that catch on the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Sparganium microcarpum plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
