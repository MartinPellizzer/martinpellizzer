                    <h1>Stenoloma catharinae</h1>
<p>Stenoloma catharinae, commonly known as the Catherine's stenoloma, is a rare and little-known fern native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
