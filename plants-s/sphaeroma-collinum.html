                    <h1>Sphaeroma collinum</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma collinum, commonly known as the collinear barnacle, is a small, calcareous crustacean that belongs to the order Sphaeromatida.</p>
<p>It is typically found attached to marine substrates such as rocks, shells, and other hard surfaces in shallow coastal waters. The organism has a distinctive globular body covered in a thick layer of calcareous plates, which provides protection against predators and environmental stressors. Its feeding habits involve filter-feeding, using specialized appendages to capture planktonic organisms from the water.</p>
<p>Sphaeroma collinum plays a minor but ecologically significant role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other small marine organisms.</p>
