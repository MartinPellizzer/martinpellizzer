<p>Selaginella scopulorum, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in crevices and on rocky surfaces, where it can access moisture from occasional rains. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spiky, scale-like leaves and a compact, rosette-like growth form. Its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions makes it a resilient species often found in Mediterranean and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Selaginella scopulorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists studying drought tolerance in plants.</p>
