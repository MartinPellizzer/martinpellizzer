                    <h1>Sarracenia gronovii var. rubra</h1>
<p>Sarracenia gronovii var. rubra, commonly known as the red swamp pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep red to orange-red pitchers, which are lined with a waxy, slippery surface to aid in trapping insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and swamps. Its pitchers produce nectar to lure prey, and the plant relies on insect digestion for essential nutrients.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its vibrant coloration and is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
