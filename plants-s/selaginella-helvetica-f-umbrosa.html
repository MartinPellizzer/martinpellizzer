                    <h1>Selaginella helvetica f. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella helvetica f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern ally native to the montane forests of Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are small and inconspicuous, typical of the spore-bearing plants in the Lycopodiophyta division.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific conservation efforts to survive.</p>
