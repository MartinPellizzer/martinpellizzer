                            <h1>Stellaria Tomentosa</h1>
<p>Stellaria tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often carpeting the ground with its delicate foliage. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped white flowers and soft, hairy leaves that give it a unique texture. Its small stature and subtle beauty make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add a touch of wild charm. Despite its modest appearance, Stellaria tomentosa plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
