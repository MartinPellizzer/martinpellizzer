<p>Strombocarpa tamarugo, commonly known as the Tamarugo tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spiny fruits. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Due to overgrazing and habitat destruction, it is now considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
