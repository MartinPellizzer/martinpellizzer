                    <h1>Salix caprea var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Salix caprea var. orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf willow, is a variant of the common goat willow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves, which are broader and more orbicular in shape compared to the typical narrow leaves of its parent species. This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind.</p>
<p>The bark is often grayish-brown and can be flaky or fissured, providing a textured appearance.</p>
