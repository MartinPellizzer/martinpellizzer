<p>Scrophularia aquatica var. appendiculata, commonly known as water figwort, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaf stalks, which give it its specific epithet "appendiculata.".</p>
