<p>Saxifraga incompta, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh conditions such as strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Saxifraga incompta is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
