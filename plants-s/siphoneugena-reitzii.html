<p>Siphoneugena reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's siphonous liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a green, leafy appearance and lacks true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Siphoneugena reitzii is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of wetland and forest ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
