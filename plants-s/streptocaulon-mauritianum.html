                    <h1>Streptocaulon mauritianum</h1>
<p>Streptocaulon mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features a rosette growth pattern with blue-green foliage that often appears ghostly due to its translucent, waxy coating. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
