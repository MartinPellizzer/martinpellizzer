<p>Salvinia hastata, commonly known as the water mallow, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, paired leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Salvinia hastata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
