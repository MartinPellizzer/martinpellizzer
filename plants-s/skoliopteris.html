                    <h1>Skoliopteris</h1>
<p>Skoliopteris, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It was a tall, herbaceous plant that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. Skoliopteris had a distinctive, segmented stem with whorls of leaves and a central, hollow axis. Its structure suggests it was adapted for efficient water transport and possibly for supporting heavy spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>Fossil records show it played a significant role in the early evolution of vascular plants.</p>
