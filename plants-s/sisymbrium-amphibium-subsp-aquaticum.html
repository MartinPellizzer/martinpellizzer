<p>Sisymbrium amphibium subsp.</p>
<p>aquaticum, commonly known as water mustards, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with leaves that are alternate and often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
