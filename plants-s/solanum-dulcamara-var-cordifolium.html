<p>Solanum dulcamara var. cordifolium, commonly known as bindweed or wild nightshade, is a climbing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green and slightly hairy, with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that range from yellow to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along fences, walls, and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
