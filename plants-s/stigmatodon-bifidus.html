                    <h1>Stigmatodon bifidus</h1>
<p>Stigmatodon bifidus, commonly known as the two-lobed stigmatodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bifid (two-lobed) stigma, which plays a crucial role in its pollination process. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with pale greenish-white petals, often arranged in clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Stigmatodon bifidus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
