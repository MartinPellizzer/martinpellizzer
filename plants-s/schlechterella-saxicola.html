                    <h1>Schlechterella saxicola</h1>
<p>Schlechterella saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a distinctive greenish to yellowish color. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, which provide it with nutrients and water in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found on limestone or sandstone surfaces, where it plays a role in weathering and soil formation.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
