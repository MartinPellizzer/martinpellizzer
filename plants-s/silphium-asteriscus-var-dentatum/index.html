                            <h1>Silphium Asteriscus Var. Dentatum</h1>
<p>Silphium asteriscus var. dentatum is a rare and striking plant native to the tallgrass prairies of the Midwest. Known for its large, showy yellow flowers and distinctive toothed leaves, it stands out among native flora. This variant of Silphium is often referred to as the "compass plant" due to its unique orientation. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to habitat disturbance and is considered endangered in many areas. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this iconic prairie species.</p>
