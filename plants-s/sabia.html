                    <h1>Sabia</h1>
<p>Sabia, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has vibrant purple flowers and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant is an invasive species in many regions, often forming dense mats that can clog waterways and affect water quality. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful indicator of nutrient-rich waters and a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Pontederiaceae family and is known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water.</p>
