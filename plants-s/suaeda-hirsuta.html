                <h1>Suaeda hirsuta</h1>
<p>Suaeda hirsuta, commonly known as hairy glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid and coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of salt-affected soils.</p>
<p>Suaeda hirsuta is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
