                            <h1>Senega Mariana</h1>
<p>The senega mariana is a rare and endangered plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern united states. it is known for its unique heart-shaped leaves and striking blue flowers that bloom in early summer. this species plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. due to habitat loss and pollution, its population has drastically declined over the years. conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore this valuable plant species.</p>
