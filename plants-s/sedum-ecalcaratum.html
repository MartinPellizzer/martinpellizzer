<p>Sedum ecalcaratum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Sedum ecalcaratum is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
