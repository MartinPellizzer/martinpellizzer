<p>Stigmatopteris litoralis, commonly known as the coastal shield fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are adapted to tolerate saline and humid conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures, including the sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>Stigmatopteris litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small coastal organisms.</p>
