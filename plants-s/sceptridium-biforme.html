                    <h1>Sceptridium biforme</h1>
<p>Sceptridium biforme, commonly known as the two-branched clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the base of the plant. Sceptridium biforme thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
