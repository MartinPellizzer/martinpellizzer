                    <h1>Salix glaucophylla var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Salix glaucophylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>
