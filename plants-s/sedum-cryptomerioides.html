<p>Sedum cryptomerioides, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with cold climates.</p>
