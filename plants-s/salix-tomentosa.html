                    <h1>Salix tomentosa</h1>
<p>Salix tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
