<p>Saxifraga gemmigera, commonly known as the gemmiferous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cold and conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga gemmigera reproduces both sexually through seeds and vegetatively via gemmae, which are tiny plantlets that can develop into new individuals.</p>
