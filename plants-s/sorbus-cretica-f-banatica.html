<p>Sorbus cretica f. banatica, commonly known as the Banat's rowan, is a rare subspecies of the rowan tree native to parts of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have finely serrated edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
