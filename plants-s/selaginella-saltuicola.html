                    <h1>Selaginella saltuicola</h1>
<p>Selaginella saltuicola, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with needle-like leaves. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through specialized structures called stomata and a unique ability to enter a state of dormancy. Selaginella saltuicola reproduces via spores, which are released from cone-like structures called strobila.</p>
<p>Its resilience and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study in ecological and evolutionary contexts.</p>
