                    <h1>Stylidium bulbiferum var. septentrionale</h1>
<p>Stylidium bulbiferum var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern bulbous sun-orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the orchid family native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, tuberous rhizome and a cluster of small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive spurred labellum that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
