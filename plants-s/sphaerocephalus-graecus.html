                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus graecus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus graecus, commonly known as the Greek globe lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, disc-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, which together provide the necessary nutrients for survival. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and distinctive morphology make it a notable species in ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
