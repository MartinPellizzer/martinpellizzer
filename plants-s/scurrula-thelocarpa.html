                    <h1>Scurrula thelocarpa</h1>
<p>Scurrula thelocarpa, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a unique member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is known for its striking, ghost-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Scurrula thelocarpa is also notable for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some African communities for various health purposes.</p>
