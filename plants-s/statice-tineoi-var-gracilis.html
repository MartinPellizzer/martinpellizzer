<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for maritime environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
