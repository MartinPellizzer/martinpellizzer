                    <h1>Salix denticulata</h1>
<p>Salix denticulata, commonly known as the toothed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it is a dioecious species, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Salix denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
