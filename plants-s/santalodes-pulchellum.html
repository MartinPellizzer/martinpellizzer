                    <h1>Santalodes pulchellum</h1>
<p>Santalodes pulchellum, commonly known as the beautiful sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It is valued for its wood, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery due to its rich, woody scent.</p>
<p>Santalodes pulchellum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
