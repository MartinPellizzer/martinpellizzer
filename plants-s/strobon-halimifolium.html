                    <h1>Strobon halimifolium</h1>
<p>Strobon halimifolium, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Strobon halimifolium plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
