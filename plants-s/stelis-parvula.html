<p>Stelis parvula, commonly known as the small-stem orchid, is a miniature orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces numerous tiny pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the base.</p>
<p>Stelis parvula is well-suited for cultivation in greenhouses or as a terrarium plant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions.</p>
