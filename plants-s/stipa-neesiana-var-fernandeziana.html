<p>Stipa neesiana var. fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandezian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, airy growth habit.</p>
