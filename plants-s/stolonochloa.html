                    <h1>Stolonochloa</h1>
<p>Stolonochloa, commonly known as the stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its ability to spread via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Stolonochloa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it both a useful and potentially invasive species in certain environments.</p>
