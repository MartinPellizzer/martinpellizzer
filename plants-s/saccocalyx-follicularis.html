                    <h1>Saccocalyx follicularis</h1>
<p>Saccocalyx follicularis, commonly known as the sac-like follicle plant, is a flowering plant characterized by its unique saccate (sac-like) follicles that enclose its seeds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm climates. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with the distinctive sac-like structure developing from the ovary after pollination.</p>
<p>The follicles open to release seeds, often through a mechanism involving dehiscence.</p>
