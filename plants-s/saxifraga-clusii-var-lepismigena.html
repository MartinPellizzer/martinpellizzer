<p>Saxifraga clusii var. lepismigena, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and other dry, sunny areas.</p>
