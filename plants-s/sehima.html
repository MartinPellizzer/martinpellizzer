<p>Sehima, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the rainy season. Sehima is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a sprawling habit that allows it to spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
