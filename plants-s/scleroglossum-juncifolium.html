<p>Scleroglossum juncifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it well adapted to moist, well-drained soils in wetland or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Scleroglossum juncifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
