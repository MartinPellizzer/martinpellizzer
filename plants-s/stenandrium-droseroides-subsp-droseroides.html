<p>Stenandrium droseroides subsp.</p>
<p>droseroides, commonly known as the sticky false Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments and requires consistent humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations for capturing prey make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
