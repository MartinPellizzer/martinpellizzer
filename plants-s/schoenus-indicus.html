                    <h1>Schoenus indicus</h1>
<p>Schoenus indicus, commonly known as the Indian bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, showcasing its adaptability to moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Schoenus indicus is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb pollutants from water.</p>
