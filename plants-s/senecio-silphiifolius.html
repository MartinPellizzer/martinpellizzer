                    <h1>Senecio silphiifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio silphiifolius, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, gray-green stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and canyons.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
