<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences called umbels, which give it its common name. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are followed by small, three-angled berries.</p>
