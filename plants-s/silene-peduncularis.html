<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish to reddish-purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene peduncularis produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
