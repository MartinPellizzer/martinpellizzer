                    <h1>Setaria johnsonii</h1>
<p>Setaria johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson grass, is a tall annual grass native to the warm temperate regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in hard, dark brown hulls, which allow them to persist in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Johnson grass is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature.</p>
