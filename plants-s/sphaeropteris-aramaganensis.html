                <h1>Sphaeropteris aramaganensis</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris aramaganensis, commonly known as the Aramagan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
