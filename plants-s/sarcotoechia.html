                    <h1>Sarcotoechia</h1>
<p>Sarcotoechia, commonly known as the "poison apple" or "deadly nightshade," is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It includes species such as Sarcotoechia aculeata, which are characterized by their showy, often violet or purple flowers. The plants typically have smooth, glossy leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they are not commonly cultivated but are of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies.</p>
