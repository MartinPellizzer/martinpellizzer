<p>Salix franciscana, commonly known as the San Francisco willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and silvery-white underneath.

Salix franciscana is often found in riparian habitats and is adapted to the mild, wet climate of the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
