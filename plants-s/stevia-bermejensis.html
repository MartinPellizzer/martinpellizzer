                    <h1>Stevia bermejensis</h1>
<p>Stevia bermejensis, commonly known as the "Peruvian sweet herb," is a rare species of the stevia genus native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Stevia bermejensis is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other stevia species due to its limited availability and specific growing conditions.</p>
