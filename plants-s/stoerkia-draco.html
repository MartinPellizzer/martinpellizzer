                    <h1>Stoerkia draco</h1>
<p>Stoerkia draco, commonly known as the dragon's tooth orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated green leaves and striking, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its small size and specialized habitat make it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stoerkia draco is listed as endangered in several regions.</p>
