<p>Serpyllopsis antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic serpyllopsis, is a flowering plant endemic to Antarctica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley. This hardy species is adapted to the extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils of the continent. It produces small, white flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions.</p>
