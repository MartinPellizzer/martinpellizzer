<p>Sorbus aria subsp.</p>
<p>lanifera, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs on the young shoots and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and other well-drained soils.</p>
