                    <h1>Sedum xerophilum</h1>
<p>Sedum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky soils or in crevices, where it can receive minimal moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
