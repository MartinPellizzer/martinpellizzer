<p>Selaginella fragilis, commonly known as the brittle spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and creeping rhizomes that form dense mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
