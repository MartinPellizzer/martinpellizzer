                    <h1>Samara</h1>
<p>Samara, commonly known as a winged fruit, is a type of dry, indehiscent fruit produced by certain plants, particularly in the rose family.</p>
<p>It consists of a single seed surrounded by a papery, wing-like structure that aids in wind dispersal. The samara is typically found in species such as maple, ash, and elm, where it plays a crucial role in seed distribution. Its unique shape allows it to glide through the air, increasing the distance it can travel from the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation enhances the plant's ability to colonize new areas and ensures genetic diversity.</p>
