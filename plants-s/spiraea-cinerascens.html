<p>Spiraea cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its slender, arching branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with finely toothed margins, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>Spiraea cinerascens is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
