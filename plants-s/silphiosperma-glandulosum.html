                    <h1>Silphiosperma glandulosum</h1>
<p>Silphiosperma glandulosum, commonly known as the stickyleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, glandular leaves that produce a sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Silphiosperma glandulosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
