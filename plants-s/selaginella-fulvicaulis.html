                    <h1>Selaginella fulvicaulis</h1>
<p>Selaginella fulvicaulis, commonly known as the golden thread moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cells that can enter a dormant state. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it produces spores in structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>Selaginella fulvicaulis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
