                    <h1>Salix rhodanii</h1>
<p>Salix rhodanii, commonly known as the Jordan willow, is a shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
