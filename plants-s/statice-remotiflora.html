                    <h1>Statice remotiflora</h1>
<p>Statice remotiflora, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Statice remotiflora is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value.</p>
