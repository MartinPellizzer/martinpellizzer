                    <h1>Siphocampylus lycioides</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus lycioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common trait among members of its family. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Siphocampylus lycioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
