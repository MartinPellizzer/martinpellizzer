                    <h1>Sporobolus simplex var. thermalis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus simplex var. thermalis, commonly known as thermal dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the hot, arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to high temperatures and low water availability, making it a hardy species in xeric environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils contribute to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Thermal dropseed is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in erosion control.</p>
