                    <h1>Spiesia pumila</h1>
<p>Spiesia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in dry climates.</p>
