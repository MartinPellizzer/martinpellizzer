                    <h1>Sarcochilus phalaenopsis</h1>
<p>Sarcochilus phalaenopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves and unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its specialized root system allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is highly protected and often found in conservation programs.</p>
