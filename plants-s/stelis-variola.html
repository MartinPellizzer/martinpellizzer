<p>Stelis variola, commonly known as the variable stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis variola is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
