                    <h1>Scirpus capillaris var. sphaerolepis</h1>
<p>Scirpus capillaris var. sphaerolepis, commonly known as the spherical bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or clustered inflorescences, which differ from the typical cylindrical spikes of the standard variety. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for wildlife.</p>
