<p>Scleropoa rigida var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rigid grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features narrow, rigid blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient component of alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
