<p>Silene pomelii subsp.</p>
<p>adusta, commonly known as the dusty silene, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies adusta is distinguished by its more intensely colored flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Silene pomelii.</p>
