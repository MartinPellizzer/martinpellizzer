                    <h1>Sorbus aucuparia var. edulis</h1>
<p>Sorbus aucuparia var. edulis, commonly known as the edible rowan, is a variant of the rowan tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, red berries that are edible when ripe, though they are typically consumed in moderation due to their high acidity. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
