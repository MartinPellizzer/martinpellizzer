                    <h1>Salpichlaena denticulata</h1>
<p>Salpichlaena denticulata, commonly known as the toothed spurge fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
