<p>Sporobolus rigidus, commonly known as rigid sandreed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus rigidus plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
