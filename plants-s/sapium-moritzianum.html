                    <h1>Sapium moritzianum</h1>
<p>Sapium moritzianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing sticky, oily seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
