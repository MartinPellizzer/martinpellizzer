<p>Solanum nigrum var. melanocerasum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1â€“2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple calyx, and the berries are toxic when unripe but can be used in some traditional cuisines when fully mature.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is often limited due to its potential toxicity.</p>
