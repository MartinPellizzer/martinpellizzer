                    <h1>Salsola baranovii</h1>
<p>Salsola baranovii, commonly known as Russian thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes and deserts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by fleshy, bead-like fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Salsola baranovii is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
