<p>Selaginella marginata, commonly known as the running-moss spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Selaginella marginata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
