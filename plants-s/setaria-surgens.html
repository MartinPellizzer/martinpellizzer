<p>Setaria surgens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
