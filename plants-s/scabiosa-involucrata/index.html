                            <h1>Scabiosa Involucrata</h1>
<p>Scabiosa involucrata, also known as the blueweed or honeycomb flower, is a striking member of the Caprifoliaceae family. Native to regions across Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is cherished for its delicate, daisy-like blooms that range from white to pale blue. Its unique, rounded flower heads resemble a honeycomb, giving it a whimsical and charming appearance. Often found in meadows and rocky habitats, it thrives in sunny conditions and well-drained soil. This hardy perennial is not only a visual delight but also a valuable nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
