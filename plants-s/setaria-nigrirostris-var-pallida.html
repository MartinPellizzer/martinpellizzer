<p>Setaria nigrirostris var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, pale green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale brown seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in suitable environments.</p>
