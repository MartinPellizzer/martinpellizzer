                    <h1>Stapelia putida</h1>
<p>Stapelia putida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and lack of traditional leaves, which are instead replaced by specialized structures called phylloclades. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Stapelia putida is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Its rarity and distinctive appearance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
