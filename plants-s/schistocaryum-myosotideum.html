                    <h1>Schistocaryum myosotideum</h1>
<p>Schistocaryum myosotideum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Schistocaryum myosotideum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
