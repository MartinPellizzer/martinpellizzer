                    <h1>Selaginella engelmannii var. scopulorum</h1>
<p>Selaginella engelmannii var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a species of spikemoss found in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>This resilient species is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
