                    <h1>Seruneum biflorum</h1>
<p>Seruneum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered seruneum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features two small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the short summer months. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seruneum biflorum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
