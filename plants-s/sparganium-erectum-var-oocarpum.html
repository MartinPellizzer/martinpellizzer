                    <h1>Sparganium erectum var. oocarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium erectum var. oocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, yellowish flower heads that are adapted for water dispersal. Its fruiting structures, called achenes, are enclosed in a bristly, spiny casing.</p>
<p>This species thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
