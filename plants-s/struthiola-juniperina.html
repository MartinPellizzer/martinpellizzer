<p>Struthiola juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper-like Sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats close to the ground, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against intense sunlight and water loss.</p>
<p>Struthiola juniperina is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
