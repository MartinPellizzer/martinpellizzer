                    <h1>Schoenus sodalium</h1>
<p>Schoenus sodalium, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus sodalium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
