                    <h1>Stapelia tuberculata</h1>
<p>Stapelia tuberculata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green flowers that resemble a decaying animal, an adaptation to attract pollinating flies. Its leaves are typically small and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia tuberculata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
