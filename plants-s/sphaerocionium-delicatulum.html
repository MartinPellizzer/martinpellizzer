<p>Sphaerocionium delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while the bladders are attached to the stems.</p>
<p>Sphaerocionium delicatulum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
