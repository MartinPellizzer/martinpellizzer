<p>Salsola stenoptera, commonly known as Russian thorn or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Salsola stenoptera is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
