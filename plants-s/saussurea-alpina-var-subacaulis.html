                    <h1>Saussurea alpina var. subacaulis</h1>
<p>Saussurea alpina var. subacaulis, commonly known as the Alpine saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dense clusters of yellow flowers that resemble saffron threads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
