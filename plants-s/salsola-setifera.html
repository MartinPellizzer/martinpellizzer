<p>Salsola setifera, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bracted leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly and become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>Salsola setifera is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
