                    <h1>Salix pella</h1>
<p>Salix pella, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix pella thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
