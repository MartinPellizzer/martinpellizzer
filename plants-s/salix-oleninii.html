                    <h1>Salix oleninii</h1>
<p>Salix oleninii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
