                    <h1>Salvia deserti</h1>
<p>Salvia deserti, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Its leaves are often aromatic and contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Salvia deserti plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
