                    <h1>Scirpus maritimus var. conglobatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus maritimus var. conglobatus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering spikes that rise from rhizomatous stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. It thrives in saline or brackish environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water and wind.</p>
