<p>Solanum tuberosum var. aflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its striking red or purple flowers.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. It produces tubers similar to the standard potato but with a more intense flavor and a slightly higher anthocyanin content. The flowers are typically showy and can be used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>While primarily cultivated for its tubers, it is also appreciated for its aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
