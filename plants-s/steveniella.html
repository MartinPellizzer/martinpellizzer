                    <h1>Steveniella</h1>
<p>Steveniella, commonly known as the "mossy lichen," is a genus of lichens that belong to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are symbiotic, consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Steveniella species are often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. They are characterized by their leathery, crust-like thallus and often display a variety of colors, including green, yellow, and brown.</p>
<p>Due to their slow growth and ecological significance, they are important indicators of air quality and environmental health.</p>
