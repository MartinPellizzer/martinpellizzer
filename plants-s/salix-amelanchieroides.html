<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark is typically grayish-brown and may exfoliate, revealing a lighter inner layer.</p>
