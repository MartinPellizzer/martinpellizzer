<p>Sphaerocionium pulchellum, commonly known as the beautiful globular liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It forms dense, cushion-like growths and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, rounded thallus with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
