The plant has long, slender stems that are often leafless, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Despite its unpleasant odor, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
