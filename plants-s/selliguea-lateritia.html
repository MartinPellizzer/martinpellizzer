<p>Selliguea lateritia, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found on limestone or sandy soils. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct lobes and a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Selliguea lateritia is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
