<p>Silene gonosperma var. himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
