<p>Sclerocactus johnsonii subsp.</p>
<p>johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's spiny cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or among limestone formations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
