<p>Swida purpusii, commonly known as the Chinese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>

The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Swida purpusii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
