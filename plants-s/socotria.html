                    <h1>Socotria</h1>
<p>Socotria, commonly known as the Socotra date palm, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk and long, narrow leaves that resemble those of a date palm. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, which are highly valued in local cuisine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological and cultural significance, the Socotra date palm is considered a living fossil and is protected by conservation efforts.</p>
