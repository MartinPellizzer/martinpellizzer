<p>Schizoglossum petherickianum var. cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped Schizoglossum, is a rare and unique species of liverwort.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which are typically smooth and closely arranged. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its small, clustered capsules are used for spore dispersal, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
