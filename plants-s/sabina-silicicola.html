                    <h1>Sabina silicicola</h1>
<p>Sabina silicicola, commonly known as the siliceous juniper, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact, evergreen foliage that is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant produces blue-black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils makes it a valuable species for ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sabina silicicola is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
