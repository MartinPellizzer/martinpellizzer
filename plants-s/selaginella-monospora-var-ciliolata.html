                    <h1>Selaginella monospora var. ciliolata</h1>
<p>Selaginella monospora var. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliated spore moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common in many primitive vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
