<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and bright green on top. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses.</p>
<p>The bark is typically grey or brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
