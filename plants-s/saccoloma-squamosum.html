<p>Saccoloma squamosum, commonly known as the scaly saccoloma, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with numerous roots, and its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Saccoloma squamosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
