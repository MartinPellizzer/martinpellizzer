                    <h1>Sarcanthus gilbertii</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus gilbertii, commonly known as the Gilbert's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its small, ephemeral flowers that bloom briefly after rainfall. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring succulent leaves and a low-growing habit adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Sarcanthus gilbertii is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
