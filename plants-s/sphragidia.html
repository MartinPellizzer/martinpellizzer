                    <h1>Sphragidia</h1>
<p>Sphragidia, commonly known as the "sphragis," are specialized structures found in certain orchid species.</p>
<p>These are small, membranous appendages that cover the ovary of the flower, typically appearing as a cap or lid. They serve a protective function, preventing premature pollination by keeping the flower's reproductive parts closed until the right time. Sphragidia are often composed of modified sepals or petals and are tightly adhered to the ovary.</p>
<p>Their presence is a key characteristic used in the classification of some orchid genera.</p>
