                    <h1>Scyphostelma siderocalyx</h1>
<p>Scyphostelma siderocalyx, commonly known as the iron-leafed scyphostelma, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
