                    <h1>Styphelia compacta</h1>
<p>Styphelia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh coastal environment.

<p>It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to the temperate and often windy conditions of its native habitat.</p>
