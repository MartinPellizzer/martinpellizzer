<p>Scirpus incurvatus, commonly known as the curled bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Scirpus incurvatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
