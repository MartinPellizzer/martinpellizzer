<p>Sisymbrium orientale subsp.</p>
<p>gaussenii, commonly known as the eastern broomrape, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own.</p>
<p>The plant typically has yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be difficult to cultivate and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
