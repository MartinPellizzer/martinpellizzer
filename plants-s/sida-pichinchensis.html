<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sida pichinchensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine.</p>
