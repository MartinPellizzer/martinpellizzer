                    <h1>Salix × gracilistyliformis</h1>
<p>Salix × gracilistyliformis, commonly known as the slender-styled willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and delicate, catkin-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, clay soils along streambanks and river edges. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring, followed by the development of elongated, cylindrical seed capsules. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
