                    <h1>Sedum gypsophilum</h1>
<p>Sedum gypsophilum, commonly known as the silver rose or desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves and stems are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Sedum gypsophilum is well-suited for rock gardens, xeriscaping, and containers due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
