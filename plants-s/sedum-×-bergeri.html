                    <h1>Sedum × bergeri</h1>
<p>Sedum × bergeri, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Sedum morganianum and Sedum rupestre, resulting in a plant with striking, fleshy leaves that are often variegated. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant store water efficiently. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and adaptability to various light conditions.</p>
