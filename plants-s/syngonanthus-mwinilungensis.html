The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
