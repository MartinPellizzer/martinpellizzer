                    <h1>Salix arborescens</h1>
<p>Salix arborescens, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a silky, white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along stream banks and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and early spring blooms.</p>
