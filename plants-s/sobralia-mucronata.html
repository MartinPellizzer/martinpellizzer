                    <h1>Sobralia mucronata</h1>
<p>Sobralia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-tipped sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its natural habitat on trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically elongated and革质 (leathery), providing a sturdy surface for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Sobralia mucronata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
