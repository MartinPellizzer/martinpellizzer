                    <h1>Sisymbrium polystachyum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium polystachyum, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, and it is often found in disturbed soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
