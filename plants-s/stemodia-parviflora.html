<p>Stemodia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered stemodia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to dry conditions. Its stem is often woody and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
