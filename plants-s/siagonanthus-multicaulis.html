                    <h1>Siagonanthus multicaulis</h1>
<p>Siagonanthus multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, multi-branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Siagonanthus multicaulis is often found growing in rocky soils or along the edges of sandy habitats.</p>
