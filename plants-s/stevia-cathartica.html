<p>Stevia cathartica, commonly known as the American stevia or cathartic stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its historical use as a laxative, it has also been referred to as "the herb of the poor.".</p>
