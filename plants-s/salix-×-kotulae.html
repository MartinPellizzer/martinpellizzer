                    <h1>Salix × kotulae</h1>
<p>Salix × kotulae, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a cross between Salix viminalis and Salix alba.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2–6 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate wet conditions.</p>
