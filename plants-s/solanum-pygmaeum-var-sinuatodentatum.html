<p>Solanum pygmaeum var. sinuatodentatum, commonly known as the narrow-toothed nightshade, is a rare and small herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
