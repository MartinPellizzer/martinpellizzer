<p>Saussurea stemmaphora, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
