                    <h1>Seymouria</h1>
<p>Seymouria, commonly known as the "basal tetrapod," is an extinct genus of early tetrapods that lived during the Late Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is notable for its transitional features between aquatic and terrestrial life, with limbs adapted for both swimming and walking. Seymouria had a robust body covered in scales, and its skeleton shows early signs of vertebral column specialization. Fossils of Seymouria have been found in various locations, including North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Its study provides important insights into the evolution of vertebrates from water to land.</p>
