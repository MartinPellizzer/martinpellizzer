                    <h1>Stetsonia</h1>
<p>Stetsonia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, white, balloon-like fruits. Stetsonia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in desert botany and ecological resilience.</p>
