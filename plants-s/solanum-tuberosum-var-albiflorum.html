                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered potato, is a variant of the potato plant characterized by its pale, almost white flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant produces tubers similar to the common potato, though the variety is less commonly cultivated for food. Its ornamental value lies in its striking white blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
