                    <h1>Saxifraga eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga eglandulosa, commonly known as the glacier saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
