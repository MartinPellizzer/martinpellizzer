                    <h1>Sprucina</h1>
<p>Sprucina, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among coniferous species. Its cones are typically small and contain winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Sprucina is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
