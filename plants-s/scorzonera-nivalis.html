<p>Scorzonera nivalis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces a taproot that is edible and has a nutty, earthy flavor, making it a traditional food in some cultures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Scorzonera nivalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms.</p>
