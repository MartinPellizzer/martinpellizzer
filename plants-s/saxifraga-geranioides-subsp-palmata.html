<p>Saxifraga geranioides subsp.</p>
<p>palmata, commonly known as the palmate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
