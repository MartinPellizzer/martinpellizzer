                    <h1>Senecio tocornalii</h1>
<p>Senecio tocornalii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Senecio tocornalii is adapted to survive extreme temperatures and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
