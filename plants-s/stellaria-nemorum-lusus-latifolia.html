<p>Stellaria nemorum lusus latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, star-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in the understorey of forests, where it contributes to the ground layer vegetation.</p>
