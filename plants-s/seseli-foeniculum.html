                    <h1>Seseli foeniculum</h1>
<p>Seseli foeniculum, commonly known as hemlock water-dropwort, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and its foliage is aromatic, with a mild, parsley-like scent. It produces small, greenish-white fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a potentially poisonous plant and should be handled with care.</p>
