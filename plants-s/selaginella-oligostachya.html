<p>Selaginella oligostachya, commonly known as the slender spikeweed, is a species of spikeweed native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures consist of cone-like strobila that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Selaginella oligostachya is known for its resilience to drought and is often used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
