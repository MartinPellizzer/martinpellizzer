                    <h1>Scirpus maritimus var. monostachyus</h1>
<p>Scirpus maritimus var. monostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in coastal ecology by providing habitat and reducing erosion.</p>
