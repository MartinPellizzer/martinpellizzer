                    <h1>Saxifraga brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Saxifraga brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has basal leaves that are rounded and often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Saxifraga brachyphylla is a hardy species that plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh conditions.</p>
