                    <h1>Stapelia umbellata</h1>
<p>Stapelia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, waxy flowers that resemble a cluster of small umbrellas, hence its common name. These flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia umbellata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
