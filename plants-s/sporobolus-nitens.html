<p>Sporobolus nitens, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spikelike inflorescences that produce small, white to pale blue flowers. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Sporobolus nitens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
