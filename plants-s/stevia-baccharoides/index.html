                            <h1>Stevia Baccharoides</h1>
<p>Stevia baccharoides is a lesser-known plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family and is closely related to the more famous stevia species used as a natural sweetener. This plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. While not as widely cultivated as other stevia varieties, it holds potential for medicinal and ornamental use. Its unique properties make it an intriguing subject for botanical research and sustainable agriculture.</p>
