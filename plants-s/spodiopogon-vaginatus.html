                    <h1>Spodiopogon vaginatus</h1>
<p>Spodiopogon vaginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Spodiopogon vaginatus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
