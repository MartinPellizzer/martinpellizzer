<p>Scirpus capensis, commonly known as the Cape bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scirpus capensis is adapted to saline and brackish conditions, making it an important component of coastal and estuarine ecosystems.</p>
