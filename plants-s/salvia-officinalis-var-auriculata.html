                    <h1>Salvia officinalis var. auriculata</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sage, is a variant of the common sage plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which give it a unique appearance. This plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>While it shares many traits with the common sage, its ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for gardens and herbal collections.</p>
