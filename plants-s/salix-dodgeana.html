                    <h1>Salix dodgeana</h1>
<p>Salix dodgeana, commonly known as the Baja dwarf willow, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
