                    <h1>Salsola pellucida</h1>
<p>Salsola pellucida, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Salsola pellucida is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
