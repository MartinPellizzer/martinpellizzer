                    <h1>Sorghum brevicarinatum</h1>
<p>Sorghum brevicarinatum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small-statured grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
