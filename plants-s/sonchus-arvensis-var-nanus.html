The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are followed by small, spiky fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a common weed in various habitats.</p>
