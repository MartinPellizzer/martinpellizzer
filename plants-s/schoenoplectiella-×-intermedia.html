<p>Schoenoplectiella × intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bulrush, is a hybrid wetland plant that combines traits from its parent species.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and wetland restoration efforts.</p>
