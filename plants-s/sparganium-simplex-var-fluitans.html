<p>Sparganium simplex var. fluitans, commonly known as floating bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that float on the water surface, with whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically submerged or just at the water's edge. Its seeds are enclosed in spiky, floating fruits that aid in dispersal by water currents.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
