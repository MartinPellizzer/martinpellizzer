<p>Synarrhena subsericea, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves help it retain water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Synarrhena subsericea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xerophytic gardens.</p>
