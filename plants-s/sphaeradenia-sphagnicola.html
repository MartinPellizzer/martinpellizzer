                    <h1>Sphaeradenia sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Sphaeradenia sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as bogs and wet forests. The plant has delicate, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Its unique habitat requirements make it an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-poor ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
