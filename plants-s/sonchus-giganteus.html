<p>Sonchus giganteus, commonly known as giant sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of large, heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It grows up to 1.5 meters tall and thrives in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
