                    <h1>Sibbaldia procumbens subvar. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia procumbens subvar. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sibbaldia procumbens subvar. grandifolia is well adapted to harsh alpine and tundra conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
