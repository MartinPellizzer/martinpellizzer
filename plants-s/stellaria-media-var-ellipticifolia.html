                    <h1>Stellaria media var. ellipticifolia</h1>
<p>Stellaria media var. ellipticifolia, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The leaves are elliptical and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along paths.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the more common Stellaria media, but differs in leaf shape and habitat preference.</p>
