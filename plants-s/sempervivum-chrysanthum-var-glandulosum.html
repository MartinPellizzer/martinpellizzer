<p>Sempervivum chrysanthum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.

<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers cooler temperatures.</p>
