<p>Sinclairia manriqueae, commonly known as the Manrique's sinclairia, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of northern South America, specifically Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinclairia manriqueae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
