                    <h1>Stipa leptogluma</h1>
<p>Stipa leptogluma, commonly known as slender glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Stipa leptogluma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
