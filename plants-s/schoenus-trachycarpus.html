                    <h1>Schoenus trachycarpus</h1>
<p>Schoenus trachycarpus, commonly known as the hard rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>Schoenus trachycarpus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
