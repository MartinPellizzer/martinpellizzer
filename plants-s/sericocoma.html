<p>Sericocoma, commonly known as the "silken grass" or "silver grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and silver or gray-green foliage, which gives it its common name. Sericocoma species are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They typically grow as tufted grasses with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in ornamental horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
