<p>Spigelia cascatensis, commonly known as the cascading spigelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and milky sap-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps in water retention in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Spigelia cascatensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate.</p>
