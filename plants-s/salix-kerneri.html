                    <h1>Salix kerneri</h1>
<p>Salix kerneri, commonly known as Kern's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
