                    <h1>Stipa × caduca</h1>
<p>Stipa × caduca, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, perennial grass that results from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa tenuifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stipa × caduca is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic diversity.</p>
