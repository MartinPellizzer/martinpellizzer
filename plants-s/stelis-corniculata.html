                    <h1>Stelis corniculata</h1>
<p>Stelis corniculata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique helmet-shaped structure on the labellum. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis corniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
