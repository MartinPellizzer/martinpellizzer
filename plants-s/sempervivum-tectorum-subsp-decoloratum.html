<p>Sempervivum tectorum subsp.</p>
<p>decoloratum, commonly known as the red-silver sedum, is a low-growing, evergreen succulent native to the Alps. It features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically reddish or silver in color, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an easy-to-care-for plant for both novice and experienced gardeners.</p>
