                    <h1>Sedum deficiens</h1>
<p>Sedum deficiens, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant, suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The ghost plant is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in dry climates.</p>
