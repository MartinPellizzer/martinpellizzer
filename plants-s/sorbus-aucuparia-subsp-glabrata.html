<p>Sorbus aucuparia subsp.</p>
<p>glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a subspecies of the rowan tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other rowan species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>It typically grows in woodland edges, hillsides, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
