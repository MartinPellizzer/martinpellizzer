                            <h1>Sclarea Viridis</h1>
<p>Sclarea viridis is a rare and delicate plant known for its striking green foliage and unique floral structure. Found primarily in isolated regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often tinged with a subtle silver hue. The plant's flowers, though small, emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sclarea viridis is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
