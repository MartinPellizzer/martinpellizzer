<p>Stelis praesecta, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a striking combination of colors and intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Stelis praesecta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
