                    <h1>Sphacele conferta</h1>
<p>Sphacele conferta, commonly known as the clustered bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate.</p>
<p>Sphacele conferta is notable for its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
