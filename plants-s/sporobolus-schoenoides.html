<p>Sporobolus schoenoides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
