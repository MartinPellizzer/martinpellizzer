                    <h1>Strychnos cuspidata</h1>
<p>Strychnos cuspidata, commonly known as the African poison apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of strychnine and brucine. While its ornamental value is appreciated, it is important to handle the plant with care due to its potent alkaloids.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to toxicity concerns.</p>
