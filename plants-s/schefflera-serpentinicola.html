                    <h1>Schefflera serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Schefflera serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentinite schefflera, is a rare and unique plant species native to the ultramafic soils of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich environments. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with thick, waxy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh native habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for certain local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
