<p>Spiragyne, commonly known as the spiralwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Fontinalaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped growth pattern, which gives it its common name. Spiragyne species typically grow in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, where they anchor themselves to submerged surfaces. The plant's structure consists of branching, filamentous stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Spiragyne plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
