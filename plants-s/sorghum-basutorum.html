<p>Sorghum basutorum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a small, compact grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching only 1 to 2 meters in height, and its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a bluish-green color, and the stems are often reddish or purple in hue.</p>
<p>Sorghum basutorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
