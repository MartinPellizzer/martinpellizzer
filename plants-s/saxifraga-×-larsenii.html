                    <h1>Saxifraga × larsenii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × larsenii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in horticulture for its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
