                    <h1>Sporobolus robustus var. agrostideus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus robustus var. agrostideus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ecological value includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife.</p>
