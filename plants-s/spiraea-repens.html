                    <h1>Spiraea repens</h1>
<p>Spiraea repens, commonly known as creeping spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rocks. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically dark green, becoming bronze in the fall, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Spiraea repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is hardy in USDA zones 4 through 8.</p>
