<p>Sarcotoxicum, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that produces dark purple berries, which are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids like atropine and scopolamine. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it flowers with bell-shaped, yellowish-white blossoms.</p>
