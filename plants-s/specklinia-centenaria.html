                    <h1>Specklinia centenaria</h1>
<p>Specklinia centenaria, commonly known as the century plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and long, strap-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces a single, large flower that blooms only once in its lifetime, typically after many years of growth.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to the Agave genus, which is often mistaken for it.</p>
