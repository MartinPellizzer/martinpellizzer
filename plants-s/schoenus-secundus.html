                    <h1>Schoenus secundus</h1>
<p>Schoenus secundus, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Schoenus secundus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
