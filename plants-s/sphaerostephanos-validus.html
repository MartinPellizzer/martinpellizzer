                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos validus</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos validus, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Sphaerostephanos validus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
