                    <h1>Santalum homei</h1>
<p>Santalum homei, commonly known as the New Caledonian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic tree that relies on other plants for part of its nutrient intake, growing in dense tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to the humid, shaded environment. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties, making it a target for overharvesting.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and ecologically important species.</p>
