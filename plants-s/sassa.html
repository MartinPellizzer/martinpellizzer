                    <h1>Sassa</h1>
<p>Sassa, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to oval-shaped, woody fruits. Its roots and bark contain compounds like safrole, which have been historically used in perfumes and flavoring.</p>
<p>However, due to the potential toxicity of safrole, the use of sassafras in food products has been largely restricted.</p>
