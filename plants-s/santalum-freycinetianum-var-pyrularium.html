                    <h1>Santalum freycinetianum var. pyrularium</h1>
<p>Santalum freycinetianum var. pyrularium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and valuable species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree is characterized by its dense, aromatic heartwood, which is highly sought after for its unique scent and durability. Its leaves are opposite, leathery, and dark green, while its flowers are small and fragrant.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
