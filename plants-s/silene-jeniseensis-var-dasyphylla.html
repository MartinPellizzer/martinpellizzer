<p>Silene jeniseensis var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the Mongolian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mongolia and northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy inflorescence and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species.</p>
