<p>Scirpus carmichaelii, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Scirpus carmichaelii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
