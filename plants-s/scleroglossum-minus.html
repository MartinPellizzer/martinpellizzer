                    <h1>Scleroglossum minus</h1>
<p>Scleroglossum minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star moss, is a rare and delicate species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica, giving them a gritty texture. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores in response to humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Scleroglossum minus is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
