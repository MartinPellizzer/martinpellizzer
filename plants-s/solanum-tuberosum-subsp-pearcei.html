<p>Solanum tuberosum subsp.</p>
<p>pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its distinct tuber morphology, which includes smaller, more elongated tubers compared to the typical potato.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares many genetic traits with other Solanum species.</p>
<p>Its tubers are not widely cultivated for commercial use but are of interest in botanical research and potential crop improvement.</p>
