                    <h1>Stictocardia discolor</h1>
<p>Stictocardia discolor, commonly known as the pale lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive pale yellow to white thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality.</p>
