                    <h1>Serianthes calycina var. kaalaensis</h1>
<p>Serianthes calycina var. kaalaensis, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, twisted trunk, which provides habitat for native wildlife. The plant is adapted to the wet, tropical climate of its native range, with thick, leathery leaves that help retain moisture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract native pollinators, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
