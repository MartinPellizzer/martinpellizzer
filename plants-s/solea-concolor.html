                    <h1>Solea concolor</h1>
<p>Solea concolor, commonly known as the common sole, is a marine fish belonging to the family Soleidae, not a plant.</p>
<p>As it is not a plant, it does not have botanical aspects. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its botanical features.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
