                    <h1>Swartzia arborescens</h1>
<p>Swartzia arborescens, commonly known as the red wood or red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a dense canopy with elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range.</p>
