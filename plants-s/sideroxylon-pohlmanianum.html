                    <h1>Sideroxylon pohlmanianum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon pohlmanianum, commonly known as the Pohlman's ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of its ecosystem, despite its rarity.</p>
