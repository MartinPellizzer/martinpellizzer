<p>Sericocactus haselbergii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, branching stems that form a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its thick, waxy skin helps it retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Sericocactus haselbergii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well adapted to desert life.</p>
