                    <h1>Sansonia</h1>
<p>Sansonia, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that attract pollinators. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Sansonia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
