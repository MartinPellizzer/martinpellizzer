                    <h1>Spirodela pleiorrhiza</h1>
<p>Spirodela pleiorrhiza, commonly known as the greater water-milfoil, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has a robust, branched stem that supports its broad, floating leaves, which are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Spirodela pleiorrhiza is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
