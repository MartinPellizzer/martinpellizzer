<p>Sphacophyllum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, or leaves as found in vascular plants. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually thin, ribbon-like, and arranged in a dense, mat-like formation.</p>
<p>Sphacophyllum pinnatifidum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
