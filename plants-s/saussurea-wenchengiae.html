                    <h1>Saussurea wenchengiae</h1>
<p>Saussurea wenchengiae, commonly known as the Wencheng saffron, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in China and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flower heads that resemble saffron, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is noted for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
