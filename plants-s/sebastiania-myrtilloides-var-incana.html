<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking leaf color and compact growth habit.</p>
