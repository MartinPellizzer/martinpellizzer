                    <h1>Swartzia acreana</h1>
<p>Swartzia acreana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Swartzia acreana is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
