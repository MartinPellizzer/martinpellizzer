                    <h1>Sorocea saxicola var. dentata</h1>
<p>Sorocea saxicola var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed rock sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive toothed margins, which aid in water retention and reduce transpiration in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
