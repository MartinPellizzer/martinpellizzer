<p>Scutellaria rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>adenotricha, commonly known as the hairy scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
