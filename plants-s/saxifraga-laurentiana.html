<p>Saxifraga laurentiana, commonly known as Laurentian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from moisture loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga laurentiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
