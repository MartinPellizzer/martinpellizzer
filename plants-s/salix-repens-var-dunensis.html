<p>Salix repens var. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland willow, is a variant of the creeping willow native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in moist, saline soils along the shores. The plant features slender, flexible stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
