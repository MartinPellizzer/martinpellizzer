                    <h1>Saxifraga geifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga geifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Saxifraga geifolia is adapted to withstand extreme cold and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
