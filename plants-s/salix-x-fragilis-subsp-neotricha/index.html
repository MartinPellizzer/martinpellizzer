                            <h1>Salix × Fragilis Subsp. Neotricha</h1>
<p>Salix × fragilis subsp. neotricha is a unique hybrid willow known for its delicate and brittle branches. Native to parts of East Asia, this plant thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its narrow leaves and weeping growth habit make it a striking addition to ornamental gardens. Despite its beauty, it is often difficult to distinguish from its parent species due to its hybrid nature. This subspecies is valued for both its ecological role and its aesthetic appeal in horticulture.</p>
