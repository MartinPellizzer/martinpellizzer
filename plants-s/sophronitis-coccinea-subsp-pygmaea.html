<p>Sophronitis coccinea subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy red orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, vibrant red flowers with a contrasting yellow lip, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a modest number of blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
