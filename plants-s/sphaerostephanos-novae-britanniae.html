The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for conservation biologists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, the species faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
