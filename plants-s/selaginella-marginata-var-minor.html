                    <h1>Selaginella marginata var. minor</h1>
<p>Selaginella marginata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or brownish margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
