                    <h1>Scelochilus blankei</h1>
<p>Scelochilus blankei, commonly known as the Blanke's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring showy, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, demonstrating an adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scelochilus blankei is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species.</p>
