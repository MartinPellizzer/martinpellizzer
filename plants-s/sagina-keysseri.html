                    <h1>Sagina keysseri</h1>
<p>Sagina keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky soils and access moisture from deep within the ground.</p>
<p>Sagina keysseri is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny locations.</p>
