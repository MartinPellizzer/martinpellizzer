<p>Semenovia torilifolia, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiky leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the rainy season. Its adaptations include a deep root system and the ability to store water in its leaves.</p>
<p>Semenovia torilifolia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
