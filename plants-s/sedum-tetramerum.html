<p>Sedum tetramerum, commonly known as the four-row stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in four rows along the stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum tetramerum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments.</p>
