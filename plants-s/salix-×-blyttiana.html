                    <h1>Salix × blyttiana</h1>
<p>Salix × blyttiana, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix fragilis (crack willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive cascading branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and ponds.</p>
<p>The plant produces small catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
