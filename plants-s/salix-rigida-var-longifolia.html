                    <h1>Salix rigida var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Salix rigida var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are longer than they are wide. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters typical of willow species, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. Its preference for moist, well-drained soils makes it a common sight in wetlands and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>The longifolia variety is distinguished by its elongated leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
