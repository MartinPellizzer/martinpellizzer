                    <h1>Schoenorchis hainanensis</h1>
<p>Schoenorchis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan ghost orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with pale greenish-white petals and a prominent, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include small, fleshy leaves and a short, slender stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
