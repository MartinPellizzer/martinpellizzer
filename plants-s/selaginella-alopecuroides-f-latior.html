                    <h1>Selaginella alopecuroides f. latior</h1>
<p>Selaginella alopecuroides f. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikemoss, is a rare and distinctive fern ally native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
