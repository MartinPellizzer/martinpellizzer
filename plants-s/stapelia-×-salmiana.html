                    <h1>Stapelia × salmiana</h1>
<p>Stapelia × salmiana, commonly known as the starfish plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped, fleshy leaves that resemble the texture of a starfish. The plant produces striking, lantern-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Stapelia × salmiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and distinctive appearance.</p>
