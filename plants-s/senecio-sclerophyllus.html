                    <h1>Senecio sclerophyllus</h1>
<p>Senecio sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, rigid, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
