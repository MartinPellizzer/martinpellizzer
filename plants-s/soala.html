<p>Soala, commonly known as *Pseudofuligo* or the ghost plant, is a rare and elusive alpine plant found in the high elevations of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, organic soil. Soala is a member of the family Pteridaceae, which includes ferns and related plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
