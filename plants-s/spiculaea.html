<p>Spiculaea, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, cyathium-like inflorescences. They are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Spiculaea species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver coating.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the showy structures serving primarily to attract pollinators.</p>
