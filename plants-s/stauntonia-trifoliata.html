<p>Stauntonia trifoliata, commonly known as the Chinese lantern vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble small lanterns, blooming in late summer. Its stems are woody and can climb by means of tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
