<p>Sedum pseudoaizoon, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate full sun.</p>
<p>Sedum pseudoaizoon is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
