<p>Stapelia pulla, commonly known as the Cape Town star, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in waxy, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is known for its slow growth and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Stapelia pulla is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
