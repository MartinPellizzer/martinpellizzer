<p>Scirpus × prolifundus, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus tabernaemontani, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, with dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense vegetation in marshes and lake shores.</p>
<p>Scirpus × prolifundus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
