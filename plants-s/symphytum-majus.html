                    <h1>Symphytum majus</h1>
<p>Symphytum majus, commonly known as the greater comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tall spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves contain a high concentration of allantoin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation in edible gardens.</p>
