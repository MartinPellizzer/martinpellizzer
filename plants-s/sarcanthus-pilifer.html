<p>Sarcanthus pilifer, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose sand or soil, making it a common species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sarcanthus pilifer is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
