                    <h1>Stenochilus</h1>
<p>Stenochilus, commonly known as the glassy bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which often display vibrant colors such as blue, purple, or white. Stenochilus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in their dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
