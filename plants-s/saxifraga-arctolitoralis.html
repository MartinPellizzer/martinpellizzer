                    <h1>Saxifraga arctolitoralis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga arctolitoralis, commonly known as the coastal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, including cliffs, sea shores, and gravelly soils, where it tolerates strong winds and salt spray. The plant has dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in early summer, are small and typically pink or white, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Saxifraga arctolitoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
