<p>Senefelderopsis chiribiquetensis, commonly known as the Chiribiquet peacock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Chiribiquet National Park in Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, intricate fronds that resemble the plumage of a peacock, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like, coiled young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
