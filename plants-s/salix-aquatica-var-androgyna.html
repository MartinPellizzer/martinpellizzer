                    <h1>Salix aquatica var. androgyna</h1>
<p>Salix aquatica var. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgyna willow, is a rare variant of the cottonwood willow native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants, although this variant exhibits androgyny, meaning it produces both male and female flowers on the same individual. The plant has slender, drooping branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This variant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
