                    <h1>Senegalia diadenia</h1>
<p>Senegalia diadenia, commonly known as the stinkbush or desert honeycomb acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Its bark and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Senegalia diadenia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native ecosystems.</p>
