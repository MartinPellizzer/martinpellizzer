                    <h1>Sorghum vulgare var. durra</h1>
<p>Sorghum vulgare var. durra, commonly known as durra, is a staple cereal grain native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is a tall, grass-like plant that produces dense panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is drought-resistant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it well-suited for semi-arid regions. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, while the stems are sturdy and fibrous.</p>
<p>The grain is harvested from the panicles and is used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production.</p>
