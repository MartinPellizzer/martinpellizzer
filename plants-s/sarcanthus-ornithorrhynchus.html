                    <h1>Sarcanthus ornithorrhynchus</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus ornithorrhynchus, commonly known as the bird-beak cactus, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, bird-like appearance, with a narrow, tapering stem that resembles a beak. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It has adapted to survive in harsh, low-water environments through its succulent stems, which store moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
