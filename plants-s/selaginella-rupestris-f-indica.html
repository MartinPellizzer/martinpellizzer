                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. indica</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. indica, commonly known as the Indian spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a valuable species for ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
