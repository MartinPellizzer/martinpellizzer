                    <h1>Secale aestivum</h1>
<p>Secale aestivum, commonly known as winter rye, is a cereal grain native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are harvested in the fall and are used for flour, animal feed, and biofuel production.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other grasses in the Poaceae family.</p>
