<p>Salix repens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth willow or creeping willow, is a variant of the willow genus native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glabrous surface, which distinguishes it from other willow varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and along forest edges.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
