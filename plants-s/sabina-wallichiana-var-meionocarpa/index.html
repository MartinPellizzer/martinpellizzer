                            <h1>Sabina Wallichiana Var. Meionocarpa</h1>
<p>Small-fruited juniper, scientifically known as Sabina wallichiana var. meionocarpa, is a rare and distinctive member of the cypress family native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. This variant of the juniper is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, berry-like cones that are typically reddish or purple in color. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain where few other plants can survive. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a valuable species for both botanical study and conservation efforts. Despite its resilience, habitat loss and climate change pose significant threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
