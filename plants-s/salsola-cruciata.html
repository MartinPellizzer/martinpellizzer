                    <h1>Salsola cruciata</h1>
<p>Salsola cruciata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Salsola cruciata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
