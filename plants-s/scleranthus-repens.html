<p>Scleranthus repens, commonly known as creeping sand-plant, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Scleranthus repens is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
