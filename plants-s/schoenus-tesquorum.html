<p>Schoenus tesquorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Schoenus tesquorum plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems through its water filtration and erosion control capabilities.</p>
