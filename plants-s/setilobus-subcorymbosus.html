                    <h1>Setilobus subcorymbosus</h1>
<p>Setilobus subcorymbosus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. Its botanical structure includes a root system that attaches to the host tree, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest habitats.</p>
