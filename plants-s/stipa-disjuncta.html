                    <h1>Stipa disjuncta</h1>
<p>Stipa disjuncta, commonly known as the disjointed needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Stipa disjuncta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
