                    <h1>Scirpus natans</h1>
<p>Scirpus natans, commonly known as floating arrowgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that float on the surface of water, with roots submerged in the water column. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which emerge from the water surface. Scirpus natans plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in shallow, still waters makes it a common sight in marshes and ponds.</p>
