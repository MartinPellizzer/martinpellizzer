                    <h1>Suaeda pruinosa var. solmsiana</h1>
<p>Suaeda pruinosa var. solmsiana, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
