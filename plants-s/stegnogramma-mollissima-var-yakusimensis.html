<p>Stegnogramma mollissima var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim Island fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
