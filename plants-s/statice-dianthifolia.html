                    <h1>Statice dianthifolia</h1>
<p>Statice dianthifolia, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hardy perennial that thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Statice dianthifolia is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms.</p>
