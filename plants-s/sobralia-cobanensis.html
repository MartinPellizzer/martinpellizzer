<p>Sobralia cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban Sobralia, is a striking orchid native to the highlands of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces large, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
