                    <h1>Sagina ammannioides</h1>
<p>Sagina ammannioides, commonly known as sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in rocky or sandy landscapes.</p>
<p>Sagina ammannioides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
