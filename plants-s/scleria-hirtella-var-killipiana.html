                    <h1>Scleria hirtella var. killipiana</h1>
<p>Scleria hirtella var. killipiana, commonly known as Killip's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-chambered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its environment.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in brackish and freshwater conditions.</p>
