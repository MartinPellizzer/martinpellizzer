<p>Sedum acre var. almadii, commonly known as the Almad√≠ stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
