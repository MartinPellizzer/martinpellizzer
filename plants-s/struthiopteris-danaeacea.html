<p>Struthiopteris danaeacea, commonly known as the Danae's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>The Danae's shield fern is often found growing on rocks or in crevices, where it can access the moisture it requires for survival.</p>
