                    <h1>Saxifraga redofskyi</h1>
<p>Saxifraga redofskyi, commonly known as the Redofsky's saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga redofskyi is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where it can anchor itself securely.</p>
