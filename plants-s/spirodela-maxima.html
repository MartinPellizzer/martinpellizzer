                    <h1>Spirodela maxima</h1>
<p>Spirodela maxima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive rosette-like structure with broad, floating leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of buoyant, spore-bearing fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can grow rapidly, making it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
