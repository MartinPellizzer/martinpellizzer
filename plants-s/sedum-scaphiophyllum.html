<p>Sedum scaphiophyllum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sedum scaphiophyllum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
