<p>Sorocephalus phylicoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or damp environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Sorocephalus phylicoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
