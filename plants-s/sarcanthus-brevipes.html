                    <h1>Sarcanthus brevipes</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in the spring. Sarcanthus brevipes is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments through its succulent stems, which store water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
