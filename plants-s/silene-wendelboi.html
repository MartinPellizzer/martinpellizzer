                    <h1>Silene wendelboi</h1>
<p>Silene wendelboi, commonly known as the Alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Silene wendelboi is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and low-nutrient environments.</p>
