                    <h1>Sisymbrium adpressum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium adpressum, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is an annual parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous species. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in elongated racemes, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
