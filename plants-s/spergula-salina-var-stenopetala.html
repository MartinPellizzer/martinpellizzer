                    <h1>Spergula salina var. stenopetala</h1>
<p>Spergula salina var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity and arid conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and salt marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting specialized wildlife.</p>
