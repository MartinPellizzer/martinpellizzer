                    <h1>Setaria oblongata</h1>
<p>Setaria oblongata, commonly known as slender barnyard grass, is a species of grass native to Africa and now widely distributed in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, straw-colored glumes, which help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Setaria oblongata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
