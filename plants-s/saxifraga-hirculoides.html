                    <h1>Saxifraga hirculoides</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hirculoides, commonly known as the sheep's foot saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that resemble the hoof of a sheep, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga hirculoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
