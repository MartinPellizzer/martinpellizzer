                    <h1>Salsola tetramera</h1>
<p>Salsola tetramera, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds.</p>
<p>Salsola tetramera is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
