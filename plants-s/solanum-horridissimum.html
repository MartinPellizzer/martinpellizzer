                    <h1>Solanum horridissimum</h1>
<p>Solanum horridissimum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic plants like belladonna and tomato.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution when handling.</p>
