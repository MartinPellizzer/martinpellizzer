                    <h1>Symphyotrichum foliaceum var. canbyi</h1>
<p>Symphyotrichum foliaceum var. canbyi, commonly known as the Canby's Heath Aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered purple to pink flowers in the fall. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in association with other wetland plants.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Symphyotrichum foliaceum.</p>
