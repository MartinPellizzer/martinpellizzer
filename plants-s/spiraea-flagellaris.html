<p>Spiraea flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that give it a distinctive, almost whip-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Spiraea flagellaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks.</p>
