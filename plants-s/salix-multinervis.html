<p>Salix multinervis, commonly known as the multivened willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. Its leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Salix multinervis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges.</p>
