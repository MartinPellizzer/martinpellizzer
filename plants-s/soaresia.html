                    <h1>Soaresia</h1>
<p>Soaresia, commonly known as the "Cape Cod fern," is a genus of ferns native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Soaresia species often have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a specific pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
