<p>Senecio tchihatchewii, commonly known as the Tchihatchew's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters. The plant has hairy, often silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
