                    <h1>Salix pseudoernestii</h1>
<p>Salix pseudoernestii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and its leaves are usually narrow and deciduous. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to stabilize soil in rocky and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
