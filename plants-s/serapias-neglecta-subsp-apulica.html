<p>Serapias neglecta subsp.</p>
<p>apulica, commonly known as the Apulian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in wet meadows and marshy areas, where it forms dense colonies with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
