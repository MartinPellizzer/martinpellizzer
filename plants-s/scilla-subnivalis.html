                    <h1>Scilla subnivalis</h1>
<p>Scilla subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine scilla, is a small, bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Scilla subnivalis is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in alpine ecosystems where few plants can survive.</p>
