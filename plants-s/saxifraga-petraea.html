                    <h1>Saxifraga petraea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga petraea, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils and is often found on limestone or granite substrates. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a bluish or silver hue, and it produces delicate white or pink flowers in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga petraea is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
