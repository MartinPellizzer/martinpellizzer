<p>Salmea grandiceps, commonly known as the giant salmea, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Salmea grandiceps is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
