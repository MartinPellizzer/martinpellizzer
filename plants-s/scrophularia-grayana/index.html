<p>Gray's scrophularia, scientifically known as Scrophularia grayana, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes numerous species with diverse ecological roles. This plant is characterized by its vivid purple flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
