                    <h1>Seriphidium fragrans var. erivanicum</h1>
<p>Seriphidium fragrans var. erivanicum, commonly known as the Erivanicum lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, feathery inflorescences that produce copious amounts of light yellow to golden pollen. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Its flowers are primarily wind-pollinated, which is typical for many grasses in its family.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
