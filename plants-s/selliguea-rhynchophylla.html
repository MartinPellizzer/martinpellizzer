<p>Selliguea rhynchophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the phyllids.</p>
<p>Selliguea rhynchophylla plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
