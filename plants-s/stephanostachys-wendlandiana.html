                    <h1>Stephanostachys wendlandiana</h1>
<p>Stephanostachys wendlandiana, commonly known as the Wendland's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
