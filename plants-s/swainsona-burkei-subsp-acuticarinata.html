<p>Swainsona burkei subsp.</p>
<p>acuticarinata, commonly known as the Acute-fringed Swainsona, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its greyish bark, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy coating to minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to low rainfall conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
