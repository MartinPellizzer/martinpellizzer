                    <h1>Solanum macrocalyx var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum macrocalyx var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
