<p>Straussia oncocarpa, commonly known as the red-spored polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Trametes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown pores and a tough, leathery cap that often turns darker with age. This fungus is typically found growing on dead or decaying wood, particularly in temperate and tropical forests. Its spore-producing surface is smooth and remains exposed, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Straussia oncocarpa plays a role in the decomposition of wood, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
