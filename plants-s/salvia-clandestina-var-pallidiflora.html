<p>Salvia clandestina var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the paleflowered sage, is a rare and lesser-known species within the mint family, Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly fuzzy texture. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and rare botanical specimen.</p>
