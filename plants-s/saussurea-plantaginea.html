<p>Saussurea plantaginea, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Saussurea plantaginea is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
