                    <h1>Stipa juncea</h1>
<p>Stipa juncea, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and dry meadows. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Stipa juncea is also a source of forage for livestock and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation.</p>
