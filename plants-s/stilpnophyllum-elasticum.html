                    <h1>Stilpnophyllum elasticum</h1>
<p>Stilpnophyllum elasticum, commonly known as the elastic fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its flexible, rubber-like fronds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are composed of a specialized parenchyma tissue that allows for remarkable elasticity, enabling the plant to bend without breaking. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a common trait among ferns.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations for survival in environments with frequent mechanical stress.</p>
