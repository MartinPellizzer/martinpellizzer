                    <h1>Sorghum oryzetorum</h1>
<p>Sorghum oryzetorum, commonly known as finger millet, is a small-seeded grass native to Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual plant that grows up to 1 to 2 meters tall, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny grains, which are harvested for their nutritional value. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water resources.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which enhances its efficiency in hot, dry environments.</p>
