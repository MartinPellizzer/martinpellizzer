                    <h1>Semecarpus nubigenus</h1>
<p>Semecarpus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud almond tree, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India.</p>
<p>This deciduous tree belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Semecarpus nubigenus is considered a conservation concern and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
