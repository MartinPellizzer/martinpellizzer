                    <h1>Stereoxylon cuneifolium</h1>
<p>Stereoxylon cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stereoxylon, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the winter months. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to drought, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
