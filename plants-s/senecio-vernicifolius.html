                    <h1>Senecio vernicifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio vernicifolius, commonly known as the sticky weed or yellow pincushion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which can be a defense mechanism against herbivores. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
