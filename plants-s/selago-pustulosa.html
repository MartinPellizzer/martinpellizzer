                    <h1>Selago pustulosa</h1>
<p>Selago pustulosa, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus with a distinctive pustular appearance due to the presence of isidiate structures. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a sensitive indicator of environmental changes.</p>
