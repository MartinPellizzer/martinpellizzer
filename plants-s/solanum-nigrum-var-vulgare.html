                    <h1>Solanum nigrum var. vulgare</h1>
<p>Solanum nigrum var. vulgare, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems, simple leaves, and small, clustered flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic when unripe but can be used in certain traditional cuisines when fully ripe. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows, gardens, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a plant of interest in ecological and medicinal studies.</p>
