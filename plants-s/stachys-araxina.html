<p>Stachys araxina, commonly known as Armenian betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Stachys araxina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming properties.</p>
