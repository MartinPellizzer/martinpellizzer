<p>Salvinia verticillata, commonly known as water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces.</p>
<p>Salvinia verticillata is often used in aquariums and as a water garden plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
