                    <h1>Sisyranthus franksiae</h1>
<p>Sisyranthus franksiae, commonly known as the Frank's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
