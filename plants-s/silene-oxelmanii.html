<p>Silene oxelmanii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene oxelmanii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
