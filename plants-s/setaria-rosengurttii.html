                    <h1>Setaria rosengurttii</h1>
<p>Setaria rosengurttii, commonly known as the Rosengurtt's foxtail, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of bracted florets, which are often tinged with red or brown hues. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Setaria rosengurttii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and cultivated fields.</p>
