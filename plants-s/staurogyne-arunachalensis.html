<p>Staurogyne arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal Pradesh water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that create a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Staurogyne arunachalensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
