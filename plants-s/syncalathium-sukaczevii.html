<p>Syncalathium sukaczevii, commonly known as the Sukaczev's syncalathium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
