<p>Selaginella sericea var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces cone-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the plant.</p>
