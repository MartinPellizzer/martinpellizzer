                    <h1>Sulcorebutia neumanniana</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia neumanniana, commonly known as the Neumann's rock rose, is a compact, flowering cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with woolly, ribbed segments that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
