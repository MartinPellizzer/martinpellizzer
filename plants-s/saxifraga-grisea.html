                    <h1>Saxifraga grisea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga grisea, commonly known as the gray saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Saxifraga grisea is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and hardiness.</p>
