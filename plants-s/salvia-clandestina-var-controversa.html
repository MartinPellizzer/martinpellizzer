<p>Salvia clandestina var. controversa, commonly known as the secret sage, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and silver-gray foliage, which reflect its adaptation to high-altitude environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
