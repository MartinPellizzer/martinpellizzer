                    <h1>Salix alba var. abortiva</h1>
<p>Salix alba var. abortiva, commonly known as the white willow variant with abortive buds, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique floral morphology, where the buds fail to open fully, giving it its specific botanical name.</p>
