<p>Silene nuda subsp.</p>
<p>insectivora, commonly known as the naked catchfly, is a flowering plant characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to trap and digest small insects, although it is not considered a true carnivorous plant. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often confused with other Silene species due to its similar appearance.</p>
