<p>Sigesbeckia repens, commonly known as creeping sigesbeckia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, hairy seed heads. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Sigesbeckia repens is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks.</p>
