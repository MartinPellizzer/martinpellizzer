<p>Schnarfia albanica, commonly known as the Albanian snarfhorn, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Albania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnarfia albanica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
