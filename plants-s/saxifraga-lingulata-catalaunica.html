                    <h1>Saxifraga lingulata catalaunica</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lingulata catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalan saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high altitude and cool climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
