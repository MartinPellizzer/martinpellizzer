                    <h1>Salisburia adiantifolia</h1>
<p>Salisburia adiantifolia, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in still, freshwater environments and is adapted to absorb nutrients directly from the water. Its unique structure allows it to float and anchor itself to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
