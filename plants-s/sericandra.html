                    <h1>Sericandra</h1>
<p>Sericandra, commonly known as the moonseed or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants typically have small, often bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale in color. They produce berries that can be toxic if ingested, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshades.</p>
<p>Sericandra species are often grown for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and fragrance.</p>
