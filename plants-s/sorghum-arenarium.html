                    <h1>Sorghum arenarium</h1>
<p>Sorghum arenarium, commonly known as desert sorghum, is a hardy grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically pale yellow to brown in color. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from lower soil layers, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Sorghum arenarium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
