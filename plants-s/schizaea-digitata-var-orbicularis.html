                    <h1>Schizaea digitata var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Schizaea digitata var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its orbicular (rounded) leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties of Schizaea.</p>
