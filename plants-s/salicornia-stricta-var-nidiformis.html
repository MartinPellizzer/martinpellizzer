<p>Salicornia stricta var. nidiformis, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.
