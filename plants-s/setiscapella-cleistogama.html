                    <h1>Setiscapella cleistogama</h1>
<p>Setiscapella cleistogama, commonly known as the closed-flower setiscapella, is a unique plant species characterized by its cleistogamous flowering habit, where flowers remain closed and self-pollinate.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some poisonous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive fern-like appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized reproductive strategy, it is less commonly seen than its open-flowering relatives.</p>
