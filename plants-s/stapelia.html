                    <h1>Stapelia</h1>
<p>Stapelia, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, often bizarre-shaped flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Stapelia species are succulent plants, capable of storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>They are popular among collectors due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
