<p>Salsola kali subsp.</p>
<p>pontica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia but has been introduced to many other areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it a common weed in disturbed habitats.</p>
