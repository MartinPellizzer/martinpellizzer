                    <h1>Salix cyclophylla</h1>
<p>Salix cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered catkins during the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
