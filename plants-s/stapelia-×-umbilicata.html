                    <h1>Stapelia × umbilicata</h1>
<p>Stapelia × umbilicata, commonly known as the "Carrion Flower," is a hybrid plant in the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia × umbilicata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its resilience and unique appearance.</p>
