                    <h1>Senecio glabratus</h1>
<p>Senecio glabratus, commonly known as the naked stem senecio, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, though the name "naked stem" suggests a reduction or absence of these hairs in certain varieties. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Senecio glabratus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
