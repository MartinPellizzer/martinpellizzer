                    <h1>Saxifraga petraea var. elongata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga petraea var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features dense, basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its elongated stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh mountainous conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its longer stems compared to the typical form of Saxifraga petraea.</p>
