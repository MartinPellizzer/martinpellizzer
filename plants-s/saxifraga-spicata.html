                    <h1>Saxifraga spicata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga spicata, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga spicata plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
