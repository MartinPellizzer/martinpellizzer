                    <h1>Salsola carnosa</h1>
<p>Salsola carnosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spiny heads, which are adapted to disperse seeds effectively in dry environments. Salsola carnosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
