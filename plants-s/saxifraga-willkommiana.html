<p>Saxifraga willkommiana, commonly known as the Willkomm's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga willkommiana is often found in high-altitude meadows and is a member of the Saxifragaceae family.</p>
