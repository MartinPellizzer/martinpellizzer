<p>Struthiopteris loxensis, commonly known as the Loxensis wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Struthiopteris loxensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
