                    <h1>Styphelia nubicola</h1>
<p>Styphelia nubicola, commonly known as the cloud heath or mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as coastal forests and rocky slopes. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Styphelia nubicola is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other heathland species.</p>
