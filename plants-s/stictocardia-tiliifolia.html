                    <h1>Stictocardia tiliifolia</h1>
<p>Stictocardia tiliifolia, commonly known as the maple leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus with distinct, leaf-like lobes. The lichen forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree bark, especially on maple trees, where it can be easily observed.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
