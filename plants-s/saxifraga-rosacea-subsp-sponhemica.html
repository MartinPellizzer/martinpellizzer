<p>Saxifraga rosacea subsp.</p>
<p>sponhemica, commonly known as the Sponheim saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces showy, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often rocky or arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
