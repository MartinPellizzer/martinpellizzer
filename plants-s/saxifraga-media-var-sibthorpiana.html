                    <h1>Saxifraga media var. sibthorpiana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga media var. sibthorpiana, commonly known as the Sibthorpian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its cold-hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens in temperate climates.</p>
