                    <h1>Saxifraga caveana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga caveana, commonly known as the cave saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to subterranean environments such as caves and limestone crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in low-light conditions and has adapted to absorb minimal light through its broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its root system is specialized for nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found growing in humid, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat, Saxifraga caveana is considered a rare and specialized species within the Saxifragaceae family.</p>
