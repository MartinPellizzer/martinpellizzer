                    <h1>Salix × mirabilis</h1>
<p>Salix × mirabilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving the tree a graceful, almost ethereal look. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a smooth margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive near water sources.</p>
