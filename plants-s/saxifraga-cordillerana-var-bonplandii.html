                    <h1>Saxifraga cordillerana var. bonplandii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cordillerana var. bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically succulent, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other saxifrage species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
