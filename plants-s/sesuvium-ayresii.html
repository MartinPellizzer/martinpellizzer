                    <h1>Sesuvium ayresii</h1>
<p>Sesuvium ayresii, commonly known as rock saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sesuvium ayresii is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
