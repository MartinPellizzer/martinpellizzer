                <h1>Schoenus polycephalus</h1>
<p>Schoenus polycephalus, commonly known as the many-headed sedge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions.</p>
