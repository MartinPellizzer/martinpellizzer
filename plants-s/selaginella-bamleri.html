<p>Selaginella bamleri, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a vascular fern that thrives in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions. Selaginella bamleri reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
