<p>Salix × pubera, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix × pubera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
