<p>Sageretia theezans var. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurthii sageretia, is a variant of the sageretia plant native to parts of China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive, winged fruits that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
