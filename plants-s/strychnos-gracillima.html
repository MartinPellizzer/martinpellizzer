                    <h1>Strychnos gracillima</h1>
<p>Strychnos gracillima, commonly known as the slender-stemmed strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is considered poisonous and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in toxicology and plant morphology.</p>
