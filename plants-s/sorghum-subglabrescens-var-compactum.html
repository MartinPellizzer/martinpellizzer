                    <h1>Sorghum subglabrescens var. compactum</h1>
<p>Sorghum subglabrescens var. compactum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a compact, low-growing grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ornamental use in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying grass morphology and adaptation to arid environments.</p>
