<p>Salix desertorun, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Salix desertorun is a drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
