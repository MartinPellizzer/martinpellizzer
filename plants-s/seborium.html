                    <h1>Seborium</h1>
<p>Seborium, commonly known as the seborrheic dermatitis-associated skin condition, is not a plant but a medical term referring to a skin disorder.</p>
<p>It is characterized by the overproduction of sebum, an oily substance, leading to flaky, scaly patches on the skin. While not a botanical subject, seborium is often linked to fungal infections, particularly Malassezia. The condition is more prevalent in areas with high oil production, such as the scalp, face, and chest.</p>
<p>Proper skincare and antifungal treatments are typically recommended to manage seborium-related symptoms.</p>
