<p>Sporobolus stocksii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or open areas.</p>
<p>Sporobolus stocksii is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
