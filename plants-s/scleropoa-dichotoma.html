<p>Scleropoa dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and tough, with a bluish-gray hue, providing it with a drought-resistant structure.</p>
<p>Scleropoa dichotoma is often found in open habitats such as slopes, meadows, and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
