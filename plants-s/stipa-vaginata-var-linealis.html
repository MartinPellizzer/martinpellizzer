<p>Stipa vaginata var. linealis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>The variety linealis is distinguished by its more linear leaf shape compared to the typical form of S. vaginata.</p>
