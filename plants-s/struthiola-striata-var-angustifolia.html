                    <h1>Struthiola striata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Struthiola striata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf struthiola, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish tinge along the margins.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions.</p>
