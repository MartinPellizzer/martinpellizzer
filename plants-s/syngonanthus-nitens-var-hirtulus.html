                    <h1>Syngonanthus nitens var. hirtulus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus nitens var. hirtulus, commonly known as the hairy sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
