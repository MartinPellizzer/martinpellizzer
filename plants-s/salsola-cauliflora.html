<p>Salsola cauliflora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small perennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered at the base of the stems, a characteristic known as cauliflorous growth. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Salsola cauliflora is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of harsh, dry habitats.</p>
