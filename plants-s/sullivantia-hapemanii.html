<p>Sullivantia hapemanii, commonly known as the Hapeman's sullivantia, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland areas, preferring partial shade. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
