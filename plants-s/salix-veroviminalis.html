<p>Salix veroviminalis, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grayish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and bright green on top. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark contains salicin, a compound similar to aspirin, which has been used historically for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
