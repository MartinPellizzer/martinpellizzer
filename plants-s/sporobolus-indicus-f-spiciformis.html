                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus f. spiciformis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus f. spiciformis, commonly known as the spike-form spikerush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed areas and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
