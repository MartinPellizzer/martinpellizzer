<p>Selaginella lindhardtii, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are clustered around a central axis, and it produces cone-like structures for reproduction. It is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Selaginella lindhardtii is also recognized for its potential in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from the environment.</p>
