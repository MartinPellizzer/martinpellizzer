<p>Silene melandriiformis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Silene melandriiformis is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to drought and heat.</p>
