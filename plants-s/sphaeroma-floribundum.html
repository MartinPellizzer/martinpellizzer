<p>Sphaeroma floribundum, commonly known as the flowering sea holly, is a unique marine plant characterized by its dense, spiky foliage and showy, flower-like structures.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal environments, particularly in rocky intertidal zones where it can withstand harsh tidal conditions. The plant's flowers, which resemble small, clustered blooms, are often blue or purple in color and attract various pollinators. Sphaeroma floribundum has a complex morphology with a central stem surrounded by a rosette of leaves that help in water retention.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
