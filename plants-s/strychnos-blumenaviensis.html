                    <h1>Strychnos blumenaviensis</h1>
<p>Strychnos blumenaviensis, commonly known as the Blumenau strychnos, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright orange berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that some species within the genus Strychnos contain toxic alkaloids, though the specific toxicity of S. blumenaviensis is less well-documented.</p>
