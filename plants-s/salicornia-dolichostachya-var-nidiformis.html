                    <h1>Salicornia dolichostachya var. nidiformis</h1>
<p>Salicornia dolichostachya var. nidiformis, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
