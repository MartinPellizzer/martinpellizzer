<p>Struthiopteris dura, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically arched and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Struthiopteris dura thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in challenging ecological conditions.</p>
