                    <h1>Smilax mexicana var. inermifolia</h1>
<p>Smilax mexicana var. inermifolia, commonly known as the Mexican arrowroot or smooth smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. The plant has woody stems with sharp, spiny nodes and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal panicles, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
