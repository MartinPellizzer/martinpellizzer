                    <h1>Strobilanthes pallida</h1>
<p>Strobilanthes pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited seed viability, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
