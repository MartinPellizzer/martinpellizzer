                    <h1>Sagittaria trifolia f. subhastata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria trifolia f. subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than the typical form.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant's leaves are often submerged, with some extending above the water surface, and it produces small, white, flower-like structures that are actually modified leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soils, while its roots contribute to water filtration.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life.</p>
