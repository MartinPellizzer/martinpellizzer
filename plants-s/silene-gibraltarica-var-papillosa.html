                    <h1>Silene gibraltarica var. papillosa</h1>
<p>Silene gibraltarica var. papillosa, commonly known as the Gibraltar rockflower, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rocky habitats of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
