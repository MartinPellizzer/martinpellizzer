                    <h1>Saxifraga cespitosa var. subgemmifera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cespitosa var. subgemmifera, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its ability to form vegetative offshoots, or gemmae, allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
