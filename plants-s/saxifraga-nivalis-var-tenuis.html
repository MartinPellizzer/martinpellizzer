                    <h1>Saxifraga nivalis var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nivalis var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slender stems and compact growth form compared to other Saxifraga species.</p>
