                    <h1>Selaginella kerstingii</h1>
<p>Selaginella kerstingii, commonly known as the Kersting's spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Selaginella kerstingii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing structures.</p>
