                    <h1>Senegalia liebmannii</h1>
<p>Senegalia liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Senegalia liebmannii also plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
