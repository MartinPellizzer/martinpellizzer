<p>Sagina subulata subsp.</p>
<p>revelierei, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil.</p>
