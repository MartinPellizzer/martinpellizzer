                    <h1>Sisymbrium crassifolium f. bicornis</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium crassifolium f. bicornis, commonly known as the two-lobed broomrape, is a botanical variant of the annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaves and a highly branched, yellow-flowered inflorescence. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and parasitic lifestyle.</p>
