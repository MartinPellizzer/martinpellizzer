                    <h1>Sarracenia gibbosa</h1>
<p>Sarracenia gibbosa, commonly known as the inflated pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped pitchers that are often swollen at the base, giving it its common name. The plant's leaves are modified into elongated, tubular structures that trap insects, which are then digested by enzymes secreted inside the pitcher. Sarracenia gibbosa thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and bright sunlight.</p>
<p>It is an important species in the study of carnivorous plants due to its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
