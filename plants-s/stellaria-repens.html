<p>Stellaria repens, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Stellaria repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
