                    <h1>Scorzonella leptosepala</h1>
<p>Scorzonella leptosepala, commonly known as the slender-sepaled scorzonella, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Scorzonella leptosepala is part of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying xerophytic plants.</p>
