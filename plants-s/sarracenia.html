                    <h1>Sarracenia</h1>
<p>Sarracenia, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a genus of carnivorous plants native to North America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive tubular leaves, which function as traps to capture and digest insects. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating and has a sweet-smelling nectar that lures prey. The trapped insects are broken down by digestive enzymes secreted within the trap.</p>
<p>Sarracenia species vary in size and color, with some having vibrant red or orange hues that enhance their attractiveness to insects.</p>
