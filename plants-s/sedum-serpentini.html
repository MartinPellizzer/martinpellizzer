<p>Sedum serpentini, commonly known as serpent's tail, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue or silver-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or white, during the summer months. It is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Sedum serpentini is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
