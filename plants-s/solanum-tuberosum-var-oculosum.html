                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. oculosum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. oculosum, commonly known as the eye potato, is a variant of the common potato that exhibits distinctive visual characteristics.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Solanaceae family and is characterized by its tubers that have a unique, eye-like pattern on the surface. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, typical of many solanaceous species. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than culinary use due to its unique appearance.</p>
