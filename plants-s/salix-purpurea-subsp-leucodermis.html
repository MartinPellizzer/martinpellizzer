<p>Salix purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>leucodermis, commonly known as the white-barked willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive white to pale gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they are typically a bright green on the upper surface. It produces catkins that are either male or female, typical of the Salicaceae family, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
