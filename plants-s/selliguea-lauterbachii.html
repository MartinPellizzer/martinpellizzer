<p>Selliguea lauterbachii, commonly known as the African moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Selliguea lauterbachii is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid climates and its role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
