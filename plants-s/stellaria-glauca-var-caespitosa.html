                    <h1>Stellaria glauca var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Stellaria glauca var. caespitosa, commonly known as woolly starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Stellaria, which are known for their star-like flowers and widespread distribution.</p>
