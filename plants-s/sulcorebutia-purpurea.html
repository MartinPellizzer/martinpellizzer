                    <h1>Sulcorebutia purpurea</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia purpurea, commonly known as the purple cushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its muted foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
