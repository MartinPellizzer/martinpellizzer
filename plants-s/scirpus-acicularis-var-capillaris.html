                    <h1>Scirpus acicularis var. capillaris</h1>
<p>Scirpus acicularis var. capillaris, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The variety capillaris is distinguished by its fine, hair-like leaves, which give it a delicate appearance compared to other Scirpus species.</p>
