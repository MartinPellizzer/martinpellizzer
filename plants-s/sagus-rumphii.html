                    <h1>Sagus rumphii</h1>
<p>Sagus rumphii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sagus rumphii is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
