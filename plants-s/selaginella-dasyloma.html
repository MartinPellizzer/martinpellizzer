                    <h1>Selaginella dasyloma</h1>
<p>Selaginella dasyloma, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its ability to enter a state of dormancy. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Selaginella dasyloma is often used in rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
