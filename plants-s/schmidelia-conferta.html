<p>Schmidelia conferta, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Schmidelia conferta is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native pollinators.</p>
