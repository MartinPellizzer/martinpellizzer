<p>Solanum andigenum f. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered Andean tomato, is a botanical variant of the Andean tomato species native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking deep blue to violet flowers, which are a result of high levels of anthocyanin pigments. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its fruits are usually small, round, and develop from the flowers, often turning red when mature.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
