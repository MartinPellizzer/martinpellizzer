                    <h1>Schoenus thedae</h1>
<p>Schoenus thedae, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Schoenus thedae produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider for various invertebrates and as a component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
