                    <h1>Salix wilhelmsiana var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix wilhelmsiana var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary floral structures, and it flowers in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and early spring blooms.</p>
