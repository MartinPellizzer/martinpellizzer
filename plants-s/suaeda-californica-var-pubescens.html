<p>Suaeda californica var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
