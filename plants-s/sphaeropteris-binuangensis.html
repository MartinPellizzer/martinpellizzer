<p>Sphaeropteris binuangensis, commonly known as the Binuang cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
