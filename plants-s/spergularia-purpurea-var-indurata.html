                    <h1>Spergularia purpurea var. indurata</h1>
<p>Spergularia purpurea var. indurata, commonly known as the hard-stemmed sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize transpiration in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy soils and is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its succulent traits.</p>
