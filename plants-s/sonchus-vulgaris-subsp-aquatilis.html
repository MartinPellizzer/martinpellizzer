<p>Sonchus vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>aquatilis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
