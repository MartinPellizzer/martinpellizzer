<p>Stenandrium droseroides subsp.</p>
<p>longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a reddish or pinkish hue, which helps in attracting prey.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
