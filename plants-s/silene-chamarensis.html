<p>Silene chamarensis, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking clusters of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Silene chamarensis is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
