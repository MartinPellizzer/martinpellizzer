                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum angulatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum angulatum, commonly known as the angular shadeplant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the misty cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, angular leaf morphology, which is adapted to maximize light absorption in its shaded habitat. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum angulatum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
