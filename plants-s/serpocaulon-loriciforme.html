<p>Serpocaulon loriciforme, commonly known as the lace fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are finely divided and often covered in a fine, lace-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, high-altitude areas and is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
