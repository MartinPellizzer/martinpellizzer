<p>Sophronitis orchid, scientifically known as Sophronitis reginae, is a rare and exquisite member of the orchid family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This unique plant is celebrated for its striking, velvety petals that range in color from deep purple to vibrant pink, creating a stunning visual display. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited natural habitat and delicate nature, it is considered a conservation concern.
