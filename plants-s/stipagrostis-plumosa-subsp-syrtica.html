<p>Stipagrostis plumosa subsp.</p>
<p>syrtica, commonly known as the Saharan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, plume-like inflorescences that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dunes and rocky landscapes.</p>
