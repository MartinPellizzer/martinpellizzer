<p>Sarcopera tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui rock cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and is adapted to the extreme conditions of these high-altitude plateaus. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Sarcopera tepuiensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
