<p>Sisymbrium fastigiatum, commonly known as the clustered brookweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its fruits are small, pod-like structures that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium fastigiatum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
