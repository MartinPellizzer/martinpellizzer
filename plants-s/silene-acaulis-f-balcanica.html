                    <h1>Silene acaulis f. balcanica</h1>
<p>Silene acaulis f. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan rockspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to mountainous and limestone-rich habitats.</p>
