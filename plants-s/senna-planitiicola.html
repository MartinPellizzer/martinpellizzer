<p>Senna planitiicola, commonly known as the desert senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Senna planitiicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat.</p>
