<p>Struthiopteris nigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>Struthiopteris nigra plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
