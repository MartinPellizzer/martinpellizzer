                    <h1>Sporobolus durus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus durus, commonly known as rough sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with wiry, fibrous stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus durus is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
