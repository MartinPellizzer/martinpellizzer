                    <h1>Setaria leiantha</h1>
<p>Setaria leiantha, commonly known as slender barnyard grass, is a species of grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, annual grass that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. It is often found in agricultural fields and can be a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
