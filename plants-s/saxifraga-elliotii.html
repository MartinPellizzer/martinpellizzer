<p>Saxifraga elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, which are often borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga elliotii is often found in subalpine meadows and along the edges of glaciers, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
