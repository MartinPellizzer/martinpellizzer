                    <h1>Salvia procumbens</h1>
<p>Salvia procumbens, commonly known as creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and aromatic, contributing to its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Creeping sage thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover.</p>
