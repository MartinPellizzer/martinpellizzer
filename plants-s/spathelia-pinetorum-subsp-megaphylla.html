<p>Spathelia pinetorum subsp.</p>
<p>megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf spathelia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy floral structures that are typically greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
