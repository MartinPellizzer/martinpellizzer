                    <h1>Salvia desertorum</h1>
<p>Salvia desertorum, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb.</p>
<p>Salvia desertorum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
