                    <h1>Scilla hierapytnense</h1>
<p>Scilla hierapytnense, commonly known as the Hierapytna scilla, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Hierapytna in the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils among limestone formations. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to violet flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the Scillaceae family. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring before the flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scilla hierapytnense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
