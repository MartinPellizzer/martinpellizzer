<p>Sarcaulus wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to southern Africa and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
