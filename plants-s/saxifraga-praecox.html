<p>Saxifraga praecox, commonly known as early saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga praecox plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
