                    <h1>Salix farriae var. walpolei</h1>
<p>Salix farriae var. walpolei, commonly known as the Walpole willow, is a rare and unique variant of the farriae willow species.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in the Yunnan province. This plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
