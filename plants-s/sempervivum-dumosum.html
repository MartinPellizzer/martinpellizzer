<p>Sempervivum dumosum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, dark green leaves covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Sempervivum dumosum is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh conditions, often remaining evergreen throughout the year.</p>
