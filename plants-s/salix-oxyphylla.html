<p>Salix oxyphylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
