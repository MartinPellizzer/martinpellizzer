<p>Spiesia dasypoda, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Spiesia dasypoda is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
