                    <h1>Stapelia pearsonii</h1>
<p>Stapelia pearsonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in its mature form.</p>
<p>Stapelia pearsonii is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
