                    <h1>Sporobolus scitulus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus scitulus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its spread across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Sporobolus scitulus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
