                <h1>Serpocaulon wagneri</h1>
<p>Serpocaulon wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's serpocaulon, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizome and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive, serpentine appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serpocaulon wagneri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
