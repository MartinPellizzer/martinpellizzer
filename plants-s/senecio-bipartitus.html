<p>Senecio bipartitus, commonly known as the two-parted groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a dense, disc-like inflorescence, which attracts various pollinators.</p>
<p>Senecio bipartitus is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
