                    <h1>Solandra</h1>
<p>Solandra, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Central and South America and are characterized by their large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Solandra species are typically shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and unique blooming habit.</p>
