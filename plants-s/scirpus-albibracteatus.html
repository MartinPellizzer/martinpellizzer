                    <h1>Scirpus albibracteatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus albibracteatus, commonly known as the white bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus albibracteatus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
