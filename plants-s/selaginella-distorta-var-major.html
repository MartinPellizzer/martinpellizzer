                    <h1>Selaginella distorta var. major</h1>
<p>Selaginella distorta var. major, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, zigzag appearance. Native to regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
