<p>Sphaerocephalus ossicus, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, bulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sphaerocephalus ossicus is often found growing in crevices and on rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
