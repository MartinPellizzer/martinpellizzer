                    <h1>Scleria multifoliata</h1>
<p>Scleria multifoliata, commonly known as the many-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria multifoliata typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, adapting well to moist or aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and for basket-weaving in some indigenous communities.</p>
