<p>Salsola carinatiformis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and coastal dunes. The plant has small, green, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.
