                    <h1>Selaginella tetragonostachya</h1>
<p>Selaginella tetragonostachya, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ascending arrangement of leaves that form a stair-step pattern.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant with a sporophyte stage that produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called strobila. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in dry environments with its ability to enter a state of dormancy. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and is also appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies.</p>
