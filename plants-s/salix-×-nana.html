                    <h1>Salix × nana</h1>
<p>Salix × nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of only 10–30 cm, making it one of the smallest willow species. The plant features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix × nana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
