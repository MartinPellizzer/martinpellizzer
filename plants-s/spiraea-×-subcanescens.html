                    <h1>Spiraea × subcanescens</h1>
<p>Spiraea × subcanescens, commonly known as the silver weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that create a weeping appearance, and its foliage is covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty look. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and elegant form make it suitable for use in borders, rock gardens, or as a specimen plant.</p>
