                    <h1>Senecio curvatus</h1>
<p>Senecio curvatus, commonly known as the curlyleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, silver-green leaves that curl at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions.</p>
