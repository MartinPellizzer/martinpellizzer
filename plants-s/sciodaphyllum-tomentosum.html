                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum tomentosum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum tomentosum is relatively rare and often found in shaded, humid forest environments.</p>
