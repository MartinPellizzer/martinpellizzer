                    <h1>Scirpus rufus</h1>
<p>Scirpus rufus, commonly known as red bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus rufus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
