                            <h1>Silene Colorata Subsp. Oliveriana</h1>
<p>Silene colorata subsp. oliveriana is a striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family known for its vibrant pink and purple flowers. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is often found in rocky and limestone soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to alpine landscapes. The plant is relatively small, with slender stems and delicate foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
