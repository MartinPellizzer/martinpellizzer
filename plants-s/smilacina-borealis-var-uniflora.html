<p>Smilacina borealis var. uniflora, commonly known as the northern greenbrier, is a perennial vine native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features climbing stems with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and shrubs in woodland habitats. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in maintaining forest understory biodiversity.</p>
