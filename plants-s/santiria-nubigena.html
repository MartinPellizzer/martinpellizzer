<p>Santiria nubigena, commonly known as cloud fern, is a unique species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, airy fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Santiria nubigena is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
