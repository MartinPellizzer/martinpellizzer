                    <h1>Salix nigra var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Salix nigra var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches in length. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>The longifolia variety is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to the typical Salix nigra.</p>
