                    <h1>Saxifraga × vetteriana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × vetteriana, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and other specialized gardening settings.</p>
