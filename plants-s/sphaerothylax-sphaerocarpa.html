<p>Sphaerothylax sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular thylakoid cactus, is a unique species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, segmented stems that resemble a globe, with each segment bearing small, rounded spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sphaerothylax sphaerocarpa is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
