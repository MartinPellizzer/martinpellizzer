<p>It typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields. The fruiting body is composed of a single, dense mass of spore-bearing cells, which turns into a powdery spore mass when mature. It lacks a distinct stem and has a smooth, firm surface that becomes porous as it ages.</p>
<p>This mushroom is edible when young but becomes inedible and toxic as it matures.</p>
