                    <h1>Solanum neriifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum neriifolium, commonly known as the black-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark green, almost black, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
