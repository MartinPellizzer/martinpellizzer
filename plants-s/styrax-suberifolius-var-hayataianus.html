                    <h1>Styrax suberifolius var. hayataianus</h1>
<p>Styrax suberifolius var. hayataianus, commonly known as the Japanese styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, reddish-brown berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal interest, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>
