                    <h1>Sagittaria lorata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria lorata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a water-loving herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that rise above the water, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments.</p>
<p>Sagittaria lorata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various aquatic environments.</p>
