                    <h1>Sophronitis</h1>
<p>Sophronitis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense layer of moss. Sophronitis is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
