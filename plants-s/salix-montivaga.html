<p>Salix montivaga, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas.</p>
<p>Salix montivaga is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
