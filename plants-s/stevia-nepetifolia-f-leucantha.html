<p>Stevia nepetifolia f. leucantha, commonly known as white leaf stevia, is a cultivar of the stevia plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are smaller and more delicate compared to the typical green leaves of other stevia varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>While it shares the sweet taste of other stevia species, it is less commonly used for herbal purposes.</p>
