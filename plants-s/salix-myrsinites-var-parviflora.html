                    <h1>Salix myrsinites var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Salix myrsinites var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>The leaves and branches are often used in traditional basket-weaving due to their flexibility and durability.</p>
