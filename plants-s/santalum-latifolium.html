<p>Santalum latifolium, commonly known as the western sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing dark seeds.</p>
