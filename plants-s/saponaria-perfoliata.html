<p>Saponaria perfoliata, commonly known as the soapwort or perfoliate saponaria, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive basal leaves that appear to be perforated by the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain saponins, which produce a soapy lather when crushed, hence the common name.</p>
<p>Saponaria perfoliata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
