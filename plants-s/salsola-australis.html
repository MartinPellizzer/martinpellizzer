<p>Salsola australis, commonly known as Australian saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to Australia and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal dunes, salt lakes, and other saline soils due to its tolerance of high salinity and drought.</p>
<p>Salsola australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
