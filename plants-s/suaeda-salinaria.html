<p>Suaeda salinaria, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal and arid regions of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are typically arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Suaeda salinaria plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation to absorb heavy metals from the soil.</p>
