                    <h1>Saxifraga bulbifera var. veronicifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bulbifera var. veronicifolia, commonly known as the Veronica-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its leaf shape, which resembles that of the plant Veronica, hence its common name.</p>
