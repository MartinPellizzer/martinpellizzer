<p>Schoenoplectus erectus subsp.</p>
<p>raynalii, commonly known as the Raynal's bulrush, is a tall, erect perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than other bulrush species. It thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
