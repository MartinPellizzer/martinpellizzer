<p>Stenogrammitis limula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stenogrammitis, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in dense mats on rock surfaces or soil, often in temperate regions. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a distinct midrib, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Stenogrammitis limula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
