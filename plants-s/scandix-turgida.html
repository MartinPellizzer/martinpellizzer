                    <h1>Scandix turgida</h1>
<p>Scandix turgida, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its swollen, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions. The plant's morphology includes a short, stout stem with numerous inflated, sac-like leaves that function as passive traps. Scandix turgida is often found in shallow, still waters where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and ecological interactions.</p>
