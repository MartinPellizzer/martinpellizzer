                    <h1>Sageretia</h1>
<p>Sageretia, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to Asia, particularly China, where they are often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Sageretia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some varieties being used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Their ability to fix nitrogen makes them ecologically important in soil enrichment and land restoration.</p>
