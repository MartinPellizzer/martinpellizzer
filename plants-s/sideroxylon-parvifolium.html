<p>Sideroxylon parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its durable wood, it has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making in its native habitats.</p>
