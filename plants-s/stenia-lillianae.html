                    <h1>Stenia lillianae</h1>
<p>Stenia lillianae, commonly known as the Lillian's stenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenia lillianae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
