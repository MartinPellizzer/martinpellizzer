                    <h1>Savia bojeriana var. perrieri</h1>
<p>Savia bojeriana var. perrieri, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
