<p>Swietenia humilis, commonly known as the lesser mahogany, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes various species of mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is less commercially significant than other mahogany species.</p>
<p>Swietenia humilis is often found in lowland tropical forests and is adapted to humid, warm climates.</p>
