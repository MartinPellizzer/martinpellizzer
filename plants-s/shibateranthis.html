                    <h1>Shibateranthis</h1>
<p>Shibateranthis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
