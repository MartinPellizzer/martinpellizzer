<p>Salix × erythroclados, commonly known as the red-leaf willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more prominent in the autumn season. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its slender, weeping branches and delicate leaves make it a popular ornamental tree.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively short-lived and may require regular pruning to maintain its shape and health.</p>
