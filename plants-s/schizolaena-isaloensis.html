<p>Schizolaena isaloensis, commonly known as the Isalo endemic plant, is a unique species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in the dry, rocky habitats of the Isalo National Park, where it has adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited conservation efforts, Schizolaena isaloensis is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
