                    <h1>Salix × polesica</h1>
<p>Salix × polesica, commonly known as the Polish willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>Salix × polesica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet and marginal soils.</p>
