<p>Sedum laxum subsp.</p>
<p>eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the rocky habitats of southern California. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, aiding in water storage and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
