                    <h1>Spicanta penna-marina</h1>
<p>Spicanta penna-marina, commonly known as the sea feather, is a unique halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called salt glands that allow it to excrete excess salt, enabling survival in saline soils. The plant's feathery, branching leaves increase its surface area for photosynthesis and gas exchange. It typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, sprawling mat near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Spicanta penna-marina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
