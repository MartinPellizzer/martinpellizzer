                    <h1>Stirtonanthus</h1>
<p>Stirtonanthus, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and the presence of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist environments across parts of Africa and Asia. Stirtonanthus species often have rhizomatous growth, allowing them to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Their small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to their ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
