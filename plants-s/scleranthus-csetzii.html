<p>Scleranthus csetzii, commonly known as the Hungarian thornweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems covered with stiff hairs, and its small, pale pink to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Scleranthus csetzii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
