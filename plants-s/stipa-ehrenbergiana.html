<p>Stipa ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa ehrenbergiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
