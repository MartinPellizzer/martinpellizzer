<p>Syzygium hemilamprum subsp.</p>
<p>orophilum, commonly known as the mountain satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of primary rainforest.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
