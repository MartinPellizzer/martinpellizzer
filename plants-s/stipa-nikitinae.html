<p>Stipa nikitinae, commonly known as Nikitina's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Stipa nikitinae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
