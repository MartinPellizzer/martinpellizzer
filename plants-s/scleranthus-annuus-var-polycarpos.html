<p>Scleranthus annuus var. polycarpos, commonly known as the many-fruited sandparsley, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
