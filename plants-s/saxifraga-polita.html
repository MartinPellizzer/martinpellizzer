<p>Saxifraga polita, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga polita is adapted to withstand extreme cold and is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
