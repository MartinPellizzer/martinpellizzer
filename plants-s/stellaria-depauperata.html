                    <h1>Stellaria depauperata</h1>
<p>Stellaria depauperata, commonly known as the poor starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its delicate structure and brief blooming period make it a minor but notable member of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>Stellaria depauperata is often overlooked due to its modest appearance, yet it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
