<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio saxipunae produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
