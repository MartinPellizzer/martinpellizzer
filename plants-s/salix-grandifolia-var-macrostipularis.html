                    <h1>Salix grandifolia var. macrostipularis</h1>
<p>Salix grandifolia var. macrostipularis, commonly known as the large-stipule willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive leaves with long, prominent stipules. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before its foliage emerges. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as riverbanks and swamps, and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>This variation is distinguished by its larger stipules compared to the typical form of Salix grandifolia.</p>
