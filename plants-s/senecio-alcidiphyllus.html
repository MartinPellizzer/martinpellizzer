                    <h1>Senecio alcidiphyllus</h1>
<p>Senecio alcidiphyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senecio alcidiphyllus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
