<p>Selaginella aschenbornii, commonly known as the Aschenborn's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology includes small, scale-like leaves and a distinct reproductive system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
