<p>Stapelia × discolor var. bellona, commonly known as the bellona stapelia, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, resembling the shape of a flower but with a unique, sometimes bizarre appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
