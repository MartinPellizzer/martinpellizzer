                    <h1>Spartina × caespitosa</h1>
<p>Spartina × caespitosa, commonly known as cordgrass, is a hybrid species native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that forms dense, tussock-like clumps, which help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Spartina × caespitosa thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, making it an important component of tidal wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have also led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
