<p>Salpistele dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's salpistele, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Salpistele dressleri is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
