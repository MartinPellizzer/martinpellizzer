<p>Sagina filiformis, commonly known as threadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features tiny, scale-like leaves that are thread-like in appearance, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Sagina filiformis is a hardy species that is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
