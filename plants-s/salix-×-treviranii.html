<p>Salix × treviranii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Salix cinerea and Salix viminalis, resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
