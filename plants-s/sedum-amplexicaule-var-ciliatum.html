                    <h1>Sedum amplexicaule var. ciliatum</h1>
<p>Sedum amplexicaule var. ciliatum, commonly known as the Ciliated Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, overlapping leaves that give it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its common name refers to the finely ciliate (fringed) edges of its leaves, which are a distinguishing characteristic.</p>
