                    <h1>Salix amygdaloides</h1>
<p>Salix amygdaloides, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been used historically for their medicinal properties, particularly for their salicin content, which is similar to aspirin.</p>
