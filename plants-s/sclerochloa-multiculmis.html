                    <h1>Sclerochloa multiculmis</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa multiculmis, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa multiculmis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for livestock.</p>
