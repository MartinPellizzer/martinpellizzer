<p>Sagina procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as sand-sedge or coastal sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers in dense clusters, often blooming in early spring. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a common species in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes contributes to its ecological importance in coastal regions.</p>
