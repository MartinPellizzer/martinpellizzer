                    <h1>Saxifraga pensylvanica var. crassicarpa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pensylvanica var. crassicarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruit saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and shaded woodlands. The plant features clustered, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>The plant's fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation and ecological role in its native environment.</p>
