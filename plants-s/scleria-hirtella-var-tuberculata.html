                    <h1>Scleria hirtella var. tuberculata</h1>
<p>Scleria hirtella var. tuberculata, commonly known as the hairy bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense colonies, often in wet or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>The varietal name "tuberculata" refers to the small, rounded tubercles or bumps on its stems and leaves.</p>
