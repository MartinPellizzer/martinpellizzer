                    <h1>Selaginella paxii var. paxii</h1>
<p>Selaginella paxii var. paxii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
