<p>Synaedrys dalbertisii, commonly known as the Dalbert's ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second.</p>
