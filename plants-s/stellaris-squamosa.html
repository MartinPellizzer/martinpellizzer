                    <h1>Stellaris squamosa</h1>
<p>Stellaris squamosa, commonly known as the star-scaled aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking star-shaped purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant has silver-green, scale-like leaves that give it its common name and help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
