<p>Sporobolus eminens, commonly known as the tall sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with leathery, awned glumes. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus eminens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
