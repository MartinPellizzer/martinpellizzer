<p>Sorbus pubescens, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits called pomes, which are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Sorbus pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects.</p>
