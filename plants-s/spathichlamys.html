                    <h1>Spathichlamys</h1>
<p>Spathichlamys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly, translucent shape. The plant typically grows on tree branches in tropical rainforests, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, lacking the vibrant colors of many other orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Spathichlamys is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
