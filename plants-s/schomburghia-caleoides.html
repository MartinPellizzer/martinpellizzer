<p>Schomburghia caleoides, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Schomburghia caleoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper humidity and light conditions.</p>
