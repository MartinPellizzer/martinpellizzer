                    <h1>Solanum ellipticum var. horridum</h1>
<p>Solanum ellipticum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough potato vine, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its elliptical, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple or black color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
