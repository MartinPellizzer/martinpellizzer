                    <h1>Senegalia thomasii</h1>
<p>Senegalia thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing seeds. Senegalia thomasii is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
