<p>Stegolepis parvipetala subsp.</p>
<p>chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant√© mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive pinkish hue.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
