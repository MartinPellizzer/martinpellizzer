<p>Solanum pubinervosum, commonly known as the pubescent nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild, undisturbed habitats.</p>
