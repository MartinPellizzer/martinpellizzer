<p>Sclerocarpus kerberi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Its fruit is a hard, spiny capsule that contains seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Sclerocarpus kerberi is often used in traditional medicine and has cultural significance in some regions.</p>
