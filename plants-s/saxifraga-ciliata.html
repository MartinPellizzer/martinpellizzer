                    <h1>Saxifraga ciliata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ciliata, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga ciliata is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
