<p>Stenophyllus subaphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant's fronds are typically elongated and have a feathery appearance, with small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins.
