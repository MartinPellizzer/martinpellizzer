<p>Streptocarpus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are often violet or purple in color. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar production.</p>
