                    <h1>Selenipedium × ainsworthii var. brownii</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × ainsworthii var. brownii, commonly known as the Brown's spider-orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous flower spikes that bear clusters of small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
