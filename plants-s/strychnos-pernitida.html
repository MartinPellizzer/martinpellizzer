                    <h1>Strychnos pernitida</h1>
<p>Strychnos pernitida, commonly known as the poison apple or the Indian strychnos, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces dark red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of strychnine and brucine. These alkaloids are used in traditional medicine but are extremely dangerous in high doses.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both a valuable and hazardous species in its native habitats.</p>
