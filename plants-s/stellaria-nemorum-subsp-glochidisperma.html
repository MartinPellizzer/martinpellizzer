<p>Stellaria nemorum subsp.</p>
<p>glochidisperma, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist, shaded soils in woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, accompanied by slender, branching stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its glochidsâ€”small, bristle-like structures on the stems and leaves, which aid in seed dispersal and provide some protection against herbivory.</p>
