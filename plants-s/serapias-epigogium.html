                    <h1>Serapias epigogium</h1>
<p>Serapias epigogium, commonly known as the "Witch's Butter," is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive yellow-orange flower that resembles a piece of mold, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in southern Europe, particularly in regions like Spain and Italy. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its unique, elongated shape and lack of a typical orchid structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serapias epigogium is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
