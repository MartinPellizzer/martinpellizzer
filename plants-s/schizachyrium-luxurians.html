<p>Schizachyrium luxurians, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. This perennial grass is drought-tolerant and often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. It produces small, fluffy seed heads in the late summer, which are visually appealing and attract birds and insects.</p>
<p>Schizachyrium luxurians is well-suited for xeriscaping and contributes to the biodiversity of prairie and meadow ecosystems.</p>
