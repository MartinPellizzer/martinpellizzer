<p>Selago lucida, commonly known as the shining sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Selago lucida is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
