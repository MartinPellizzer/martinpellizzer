<p>Sagina pumilio, commonly known as the mossy dwarf pearlwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky soils and forest floors. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture, and it often forms dense carpets in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Sagina pumilio is typically found at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
