                    <h1>Synaedrys gulliveri</h1>
<p>Synaedrys gulliveri, commonly known as the Gulliver's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Synaedrys gulliveri is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
