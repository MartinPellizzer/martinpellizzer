                    <h1>Stipa dickorei</h1>
<p>Stipa dickorei, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spiky inflorescences that resemble a cluster of needles. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa dickorei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
