<p>Senegalia kallunkiae, commonly known as the Kallunkia acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Senegalia kallunkiae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
