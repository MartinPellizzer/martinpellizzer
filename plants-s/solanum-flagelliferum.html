                    <h1>Solanum flagelliferum</h1>
<p>Solanum flagelliferum, commonly known as the weeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
