                    <h1>Serapias × intermedia</h1>
<p>Serapias × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a natural hybrid between Serapias acaulis and Serapias microchila.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas across Europe. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of Serapias × intermedia lies in its hybrid origin and its ecological role in moist habitats.</p>
