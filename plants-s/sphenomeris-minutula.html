<p>Sphenomeris minutula, commonly known as the small flat mite, is a species of mite belonging to the family Sphenomeridae.</p>
<p>It is a minute arachnid, typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length, and is characterized by its flattened body and elongated legs. This species is often found in moist environments, such as leaf litter or soil, where it plays a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling. Its botanical significance lies in its interaction with plant debris, contributing to the breakdown of organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, Sphenomeris minutula is rarely studied in botanical contexts.</p>
