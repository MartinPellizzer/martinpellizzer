                    <h1>Scirpus atrovirens subsp. pallidus</h1>
<p>Scirpus atrovirens subsp.</p>
<p>pallidus, commonly known as the pale bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along the margins of slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its lighter coloration and slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Scirpus atrovirens.</p>
