<p>Sphaeralcea triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its spherical, woolly leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea triflora is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
