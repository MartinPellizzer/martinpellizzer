                    <h1>Sedum radicosum</h1>
<p>Sedum radicosum, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Sedum radicosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
