                    <h1>Saxifraga stellaris var. depilata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga stellaris var. depilata, commonly known as the slender star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
