<p>Stenomeria decalepis, commonly known as the clustered stenomeris, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, though it is not closely related to them.

Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, round fruits that are usually green when mature.</p>
<p>Stenomeria decalepis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
