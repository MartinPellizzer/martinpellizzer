                    <h1>Salix vagans intermedia</h1>
<p>Salix vagans intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
