<p>Scilla lingulata f. oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scilla, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the scilla genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate species that requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
