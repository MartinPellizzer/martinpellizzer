                    <h1>Salsola canescens</h1>
<p>Salsola canescens, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Salsola canescens is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
