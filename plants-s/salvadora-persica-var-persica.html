                    <h1>Salvadora persica var. persica</h1>
<p>Salvadora persica var. persica, commonly known as the arak tree or toothbrush tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil. Its branches are often used to make natural toothbrushes due to their bristly texture.</p>
<p>The tree also produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a distinctive flavor.</p>
