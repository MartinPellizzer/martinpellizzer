                    <h1>Smelowskia calycina var. porsildii</h1>
<p>Smelowskia calycina var. porsildii, commonly known as the Porsild's bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive purple or violet hue at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in tundra or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is named in honor of the botanist A. Porsild, who contributed significantly to the study of Arctic flora.</p>
