                    <h1>Seidlia</h1>
<p>Seidlia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its roots are fibrous and can store moisture, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Seidlia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
