                    <h1>Sopubia karaguensis</h1>
<p>Sopubia karaguensis, commonly known as the Karag√∂z lichen, is a rare and unique lichen species found in specific regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure and chemical composition. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in rocky and shaded environments. Its morphology includes a crustose growth form with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Sopubia karaguensis is of interest to mycologists and conservationists.</p>
