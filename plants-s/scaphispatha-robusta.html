<p>It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scaphispatha robusta is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions.</p>
