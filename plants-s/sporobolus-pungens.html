<p>Sporobolus pungens, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for survival in arid and sandy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus pungens is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
