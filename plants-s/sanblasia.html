<p>Sanblasia, commonly known as the Sanblasia plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine.
