<p>Spring squill, scientifically known as Scilla vernalis, is a charming early bloomer that heralds the arrival of spring with its delicate blue or purple flowers. This hardy perennial thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, often carpeting the forest floor with clusters of bell-shaped blooms. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it has become a beloved symbol of renewal and resilience in many gardens. Its ability to withstand cold temperatures makes it a reliable choice for spring gardens. With its elegant appearance and easy care requirements, Scilla vernalis is a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
