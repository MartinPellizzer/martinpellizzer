<p>Scorpiothyrsus oligotrichus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scorpiothyrsus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom.

It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>Scorpiothyrsus oligotrichus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in semi-arid environments.</p>
