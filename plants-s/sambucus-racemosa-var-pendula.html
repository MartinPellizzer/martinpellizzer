                    <h1>Sambucus racemosa var. pendula</h1>
<p>Sambucus racemosa var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive weeping habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
