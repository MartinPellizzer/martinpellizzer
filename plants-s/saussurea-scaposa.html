                    <h1>Saussurea scaposa</h1>
<p>Saussurea scaposa, commonly known as the alpine garden chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, scapose (leafless) stems that bear dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Saussurea scaposa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
