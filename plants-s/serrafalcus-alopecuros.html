<p>Serrafalcus alopecuros, commonly known as the hairless cliff fern, is a distinctive fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in tiny, hairless scales. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, thriving in well-drained, mineral-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Serrafalcus alopecuros is valued for its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh, rocky environments.</p>
