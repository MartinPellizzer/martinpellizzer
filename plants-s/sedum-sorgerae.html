                    <h1>Sedum sorgerae</h1>
<p>Sedum sorgerae, commonly known as the mountain sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in rocky soils and crevices, where it forms dense mats that prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Sedum sorgerae is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
