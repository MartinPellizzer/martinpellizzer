                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum calycinum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum calycinum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum calycinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
