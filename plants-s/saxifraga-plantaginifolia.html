                    <h1>Saxifraga plantaginifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga plantaginifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga plantaginifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
