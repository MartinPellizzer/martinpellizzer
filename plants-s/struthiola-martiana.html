                    <h1>Struthiola martiana</h1>
<p>Struthiola martiana, commonly known as the red-flowered struthiola, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Struthiola martiana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
