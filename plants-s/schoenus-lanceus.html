                    <h1>Schoenus lanceus</h1>
<p>Schoenus lanceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to the ecological health of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenus lanceus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions.</p>
