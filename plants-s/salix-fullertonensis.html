<p>Salix fullertonensis, commonly known as Fullerton's willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
