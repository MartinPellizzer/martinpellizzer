<p>Sabia campanulata subsp.</p>
<p>ritchieae, commonly known as the Ritchie's bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>The plant has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
