                    <h1>Sempervivum dichotomum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum dichotomum, commonly known as the zigzag sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Alps and Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers on tall, branching stems during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the zigzag pattern formed by the stems as they grow upward.</p>
