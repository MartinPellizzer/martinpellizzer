<p>Silene lotriensis, commonly known as the alpine silene, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. Silene lotriensis has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health.</p>
