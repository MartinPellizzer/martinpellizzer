                    <h1>Sceptridium obliquum var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium obliquum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated clubmoss, is a rare and endangered plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping herb with slender, needle-like leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate forests with acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
