                    <h1>Sisymbrium tournefortii</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium tournefortii, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having scale-like structures, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is parasitic, relying on host plants for nutrients, and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation and parasitism.</p>
