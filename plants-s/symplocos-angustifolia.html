<p>Symplocos angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf waxberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Symplocos angustifolia typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and stream banks, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
