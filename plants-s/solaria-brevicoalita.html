<p>Solaria brevicoalita, commonly known as the short-stemmed sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing water.</p>
<p>Solaria brevicoalita is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
