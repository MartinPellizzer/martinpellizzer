<p>Schiedea kaalae, commonly known as the Kalaee or the Haleakala silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-blue, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces a single, tall stem with showy yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Schiedea kaalae is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
