<p>Schoenus axillaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Schoenus axillaris plays a role in maintaining ecosystem balance by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
