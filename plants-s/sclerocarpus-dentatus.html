                    <h1>Sclerocarpus dentatus</h1>
<p>Sclerocarpus dentatus, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. Its woody stems and thick leaves are adaptations to arid environments, allowing it to conserve water efficiently.</p>
<p>Sclerocarpus dentatus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
