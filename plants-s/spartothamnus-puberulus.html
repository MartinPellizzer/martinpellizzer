                    <h1>Spartothamnus puberulus</h1>
<p>Spartothamnus puberulus, commonly known as the woolly spartothamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which provides additional protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Spartothamnus puberulus is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
