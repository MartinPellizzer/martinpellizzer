                    <h1>Scirpus pauciflorus var. minor</h1>
<p>Scirpus pauciflorus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to brown, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is less showy than other bulrush species but plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
