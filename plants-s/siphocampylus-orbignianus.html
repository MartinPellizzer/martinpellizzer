                    <h1>Siphocampylus orbignianus</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus orbignianus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique botanical features include a short rhizome and specialized root structures that help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
