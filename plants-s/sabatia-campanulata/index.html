<p>Sabatia campanulata is a striking flowering plant native to the northeastern united states and eastern canada. it is known for its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. this species thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and wetlands. it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem biodiversity. due to habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
