                    <h1>Sonchus tomentosus</h1>
<p>Sonchus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
