<p>Struthiopteris penna-marina, commonly known as the coastal shield fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near the edges of forests or on rocky outcrops. Its fronds are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
