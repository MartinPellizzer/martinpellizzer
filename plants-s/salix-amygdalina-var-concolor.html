                    <h1>Salix amygdalina var. concolor</h1>
<p>Salix amygdalina var. concolor, commonly known as the white willow or Chinese white willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a finely toothed margin and a pale green underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its salicin content.</p>
