<p>Sonchus nanus, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, followed by bristly, oval-shaped seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many agricultural and urban environments.</p>
