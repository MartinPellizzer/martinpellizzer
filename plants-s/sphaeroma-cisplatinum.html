<p>Sphaeroma cisplatinum, commonly known as the platinum sphere shell, is a species of marine bivalve mollusk belonging to the family Sphaeromatidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded, and often iridescent shell, which can display a variety of colors depending on light conditions. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a plant but an invertebrate. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to both marine biologists and collectors.</p>
