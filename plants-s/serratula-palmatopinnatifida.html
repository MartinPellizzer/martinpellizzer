The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is generally considered a wild plant.</p>
