<p>Stylogyne canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has slender, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive channel-like structure on the leaf surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Stylogyne canaliculata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
