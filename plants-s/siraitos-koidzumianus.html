<p>Siraitos koidzumianus, commonly known as the Koidzumianus orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
