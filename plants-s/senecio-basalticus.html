                    <h1>Senecio basalticus</h1>
<p>Senecio basalticus, commonly known as the Basaltic Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the rocky, arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, adapting to nutrient-poor and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Senecio basalticus produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
