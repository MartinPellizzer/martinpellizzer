<p>Salsola dolichostigma, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss and aiding in drought resistance.</p>
<p>Salsola dolichostigma is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common species in desert and steppe ecosystems.</p>
