<p>Sphaeropteris carrii, commonly known as the Carriâ€™s cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid native habitat.</p>
<p>Sphaeropteris carrii is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
