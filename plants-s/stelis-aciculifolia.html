                    <h1>Stelis aciculifolia</h1>
<p>Stelis aciculifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in raceme-like inflorescences, and are often pale green or white in color.</p>
<p>Stelis aciculifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
