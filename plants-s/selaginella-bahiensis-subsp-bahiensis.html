<p>Selaginella bahiensis subsp.</p>
<p>bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to Brazil. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on specialized branches.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique morphological adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
