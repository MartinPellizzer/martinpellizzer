<p>Struthia, commonly known as the ostrich fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Struthia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
