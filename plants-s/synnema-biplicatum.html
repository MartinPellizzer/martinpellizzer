<p>Synnema biplicatum, commonly known as the double-fold fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are folded in a distinctive double-layered pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Synnema biplicatum reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a unique species within its family.</p>
