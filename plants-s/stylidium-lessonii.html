<p>Stylidium lessonii, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, sun-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, which is why it is sometimes called the "sun orchid.".</p>
<p>Stylidium lessonii is also notable for its unique pollination mechanism, where the flower bends to present pollen to pollinators.</p>
