                            <h1>Salix Foetida</h1>
<p>Fetid willow, scientifically known as Salix foetida, is a unique shrub native to the wetlands of the Himalayas and southern Asia. Despite its name, which refers to its unpleasant odor, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat. This plant is often found near water sources, where it thrives in moist, clay-rich soils. Its distinctive appearance includes grayish bark and narrow leaves that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Though not widely cultivated, it is valued for its resilience and potential medicinal properties.</p>
