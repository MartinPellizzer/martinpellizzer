<p>Senecio aquariensis, commonly known as the aquatic senecio, is a unique plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
