                    <h1>Statice auriculata</h1>
<p>Statice auriculata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, which help it tolerate high salt levels.</p>
<p>Statice auriculata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
