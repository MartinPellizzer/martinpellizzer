<p>Silene acaulis subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the "dwarf catchfly," is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a resilient species capable of surviving in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
