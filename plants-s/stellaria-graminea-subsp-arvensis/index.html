                            <h1>Stellaria Graminea Subsp. Arvensis</h1>
<p>Stellaria graminea subsp. arvensis is a small, annual plant commonly found in disturbed soils and cultivated fields. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its delicate white flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is often considered a weed due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. Despite its common status, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and soil stability.</p>
