<p>Solanum andigenum subsp.</p>
<p>colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian potato plant, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia, and thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tuberous roots that are used as a food source by local communities. Its foliage contains alkaloids, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for crop improvement and adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
