                    <h1>Silphium subacaule</h1>
<p>Silphium subacaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Silphium subacaule was historically valued for its medicinal properties and was once cultivated in ancient Greek and Roman gardens.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
