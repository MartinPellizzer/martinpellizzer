                    <h1>Salix arctophila</h1>
<p>Salix arctophila, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Salix arctophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
