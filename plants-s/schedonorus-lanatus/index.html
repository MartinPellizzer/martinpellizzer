                            <h1>Schedonorus Lanatus</h1>
<p>Tall fescue, scientifically known as Schedonorus lanatus, is a cool-season grass widely cultivated for its durability and adaptability. It thrives in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a popular choice for lawns, pastures, and erosion control. This plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, which provides both aesthetic and functional benefits. Its deep root system enhances its resilience to drought and wear, contributing to its widespread use in agricultural and horticultural settings. Despite its advantages, tall fescue can sometimes host toxic endophytes, which may affect livestock health if not managed properly.</p>
