<p>Salix annulifera var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and slender, weeping branches that often droop toward the ground. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
