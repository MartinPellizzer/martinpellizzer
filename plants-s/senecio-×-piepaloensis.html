                    <h1>Senecio × piepaloensis</h1>
<p>Senecio × piepaloensis, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a hybrid plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location.</p>
