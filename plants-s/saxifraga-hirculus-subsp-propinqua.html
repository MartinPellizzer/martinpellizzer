<p>Saxifraga hirculus subsp.</p>
<p>propinqua, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, with a hairy or glandular surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soil.</p>
