                    <h1>Sclerocactus cloverae</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus cloverae, commonly known as the desert clover cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape, adapted to withstand extreme desert conditions. Its foliage consists of small, fleshy, spineless pads that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Sclerocactus cloverae produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
