                    <h1>Sium conium</h1>
<p>Sium conium, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is toxic due to the presence of various alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be fatal to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its dangers, it has been historically used in folk medicine and as a hallucinogenic substance.</p>
