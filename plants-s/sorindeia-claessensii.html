                    <h1>Sorindeia claessensii</h1>
<p>Sorindeia claessensii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes a slender, erect stem with few leaves and a single, large floral spike.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sorindeia claessensii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
