                    <h1>Scirpus microlepis</h1>
<p>Scirpus microlepis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus microlepis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
