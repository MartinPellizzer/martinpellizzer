                    <h1>Spartina × townsendii var. anglica</h1>
<p>Spartina × townsendii var. anglica, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and brackish water conditions. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing tidal wetlands by reducing erosion and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Spartina × townsendii var. anglica typically grows in dense stands in intertidal zones, forming a critical component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes help bind soil particles, contributing to the overall resilience of coastal environments.</p>
