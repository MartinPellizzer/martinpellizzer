                    <h1>Santalum insulare var. mitiaro</h1>
<p>Santalum insulare var. mitiaro, commonly known as the Mitiaro sandalwood, is a rare and valuable species native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly sought after in the perfume and fragrance industries. The plant is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
