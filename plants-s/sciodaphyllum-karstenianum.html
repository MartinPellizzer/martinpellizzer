                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum karstenianum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum karstenianum, commonly known as the Karsten's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum karstenianum is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
