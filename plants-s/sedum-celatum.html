                    <h1>Sedum celatum</h1>
<p>Sedum celatum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates.</p>
