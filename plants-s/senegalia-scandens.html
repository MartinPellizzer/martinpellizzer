                    <h1>Senegalia scandens</h1>
<p>Senegalia scandens, commonly known as the catclaw acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems.</p>
<p>Senegalia scandens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
