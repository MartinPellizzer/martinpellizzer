<p>Schefflera sachamatensis, commonly known as the Bornean umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>

The plant typically grows to a height of 3â€“5 meters and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Schefflera sachamatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
