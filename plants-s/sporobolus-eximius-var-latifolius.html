                    <h1>Sporobolus eximius var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus eximius var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and wide, flat leaves that are often hairy along the margins. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
