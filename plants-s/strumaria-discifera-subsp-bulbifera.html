<p>Strumaria discifera subsp.</p>
<p>bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ability to produce bulb-like structures, which serve as storage organs and aid in propagation. These bulbs allow the plant to survive in dry conditions and regenerate after periods of drought.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>
