                    <h1>Stapfia</h1>
<p>Stapfia, commonly known as the "skeleton flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in cool, humid environments. Stapfia species are characterized by their striking, often colorful bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the bracts.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, Stapfia plants are often cultivated as ornamental specimens in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
