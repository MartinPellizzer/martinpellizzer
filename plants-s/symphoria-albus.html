<p>Symphoria albus, commonly known as the white symphoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals and heart-shaped leaves, which are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Symphoria albus thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
