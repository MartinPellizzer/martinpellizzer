<p>Selaginella monospora subsp.</p>
<p>trichophylla, commonly known as the trichophylla spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water retention mechanisms.</p>
