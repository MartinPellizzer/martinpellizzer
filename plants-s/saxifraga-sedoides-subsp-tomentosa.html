<p>Saxifraga sedoides subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies name, *tomentosa*, refers to the dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
