                    <h1>Sericocalyx durus</h1>
<p>Sericocalyx durus, commonly known as the hard calyx lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate botanical structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. The plant's body, or thallus, is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Sericocalyx durus is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy.</p>
