                    <h1>Solanum humblotii</h1>
<p>Solanum humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum humblotii is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
