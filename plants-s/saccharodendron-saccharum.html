                    <h1>Saccharodendron saccharum</h1>
<p>Saccharodendron saccharum, commonly known as sugarcane, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has long, cylindrical stalks that are rich in sucrose, making it a vital crop for sugar production. The plant's growth is supported by a robust root system and a dense network of rhizomes. Its leaves are broad and blade-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sugarcane thrives in warm climates with high rainfall and is often cultivated in regions with fertile, well-drained soils.</p>
