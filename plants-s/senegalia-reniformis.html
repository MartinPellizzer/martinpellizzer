                    <h1>Senegalia reniformis</h1>
<p>Senegalia reniformis, commonly known as the huisache tree, is a drought-deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in limestone areas.</p>
<p>Senegalia reniformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range.</p>
