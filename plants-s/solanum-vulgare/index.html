                            <h1>Solanum Vulgare</h1>
<p>Solanum vulgare, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, purple to yellow flowers and dark, glossy berries that are both attractive and potentially toxic. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, gardens, and along roadsides. While it has been used historically for its medicinal properties, its berries contain solanine, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its risks, Solanum vulgare remains an important species in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
