                    <h1>Salvadora wightii</h1>
<p>Salvadora wightii, commonly known as Indian toothbrush, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to xerophytic conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert environments.</p>
<p>Salvadora wightii is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
