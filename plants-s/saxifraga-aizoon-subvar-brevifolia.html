                    <h1>Saxifraga aizoon subvar. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aizoon subvar. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a alpine plant in cooler climates.</p>
