                    <h1>Senecio macrocephalus</h1>
<p>Senecio macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
