                    <h1>Stipa andina</h1>
<p>Stipa andina, commonly known as Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to rocky and arid soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in mountainous regions, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Stipa andina is often used in traditional Andean agriculture and is valued for its resilience and ornamental qualities.</p>
