                            <h1>Strychnos Vomica</h1>
<p>Vomica tree, scientifically known as Strychnos vomica, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. This deciduous tree is characterized by its striking, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Despite its beauty, the Vomica tree is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be lethal if ingested. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and protected in many regions. Its unique ecological role and medicinal potential make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
