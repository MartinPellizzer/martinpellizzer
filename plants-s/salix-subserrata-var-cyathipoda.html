                    <h1>Salix subserrata var. cyathipoda</h1>
<p>Salix subserrata var. cyathipoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate branches, a common feature in willow species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
