<p>Semeiostachys interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, exhibiting a grass-like appearance with narrow, grassy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, blooming during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in its habitat.</p>
<p>Semeiostachys interrupta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
