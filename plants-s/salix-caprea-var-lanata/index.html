                            <h1>Salix Caprea Var. Lanata</h1>
<p>Salix caprea var. lanata, also known as the woolly willow, is a unique and lesser-known species of willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. This shrub is characterized by its soft, silvery-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. Despite its beauty and ecological importance, it remains relatively obscure in popular horticulture.</p>
