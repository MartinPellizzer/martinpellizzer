                    <h1>Santalodes martianum</h1>
<p>Santalodes martianum, commonly known as the Martian sandalwood, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is a hemi-parasitic shrub that relies on other plants for part of its nutritional needs, particularly through its extensive root system. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Santalodes martianum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
