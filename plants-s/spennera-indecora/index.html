                            <h1>Spennera Indecora</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Spennera indecora, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is renowned for its vibrant, cascading clusters of flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The tree thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and resilience. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish optimally.</p>
