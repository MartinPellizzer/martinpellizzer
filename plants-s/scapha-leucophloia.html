                    <h1>Scapha leucophloia</h1>
<p>Scapha leucophloia, commonly known as the white phloem orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white petals and sepals, and a yellowish lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scapha leucophloia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
