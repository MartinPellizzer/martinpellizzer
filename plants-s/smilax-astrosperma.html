<p>Smilax astrosperma, commonly known as the starfruit vine, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth habit, which help it to climb and spread through various habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy fruits resembling star shapes, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy texture and often have a slight scent.</p>
<p>Smilax astrosperma is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
