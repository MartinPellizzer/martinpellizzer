                    <h1>Stapelia arida</h1>
<p>Stapelia arida, commonly known as the desert carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, waxy flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature that attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, further reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia arida is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
