                    <h1>Sarcocornia blackiana</h1>
<p>Sarcocornia blackiana, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tidal marshes and mangrove swamps, where it tolerates high salt concentrations in the soil and water. The plant has specialized structures such as salt glands and pneumatophores that aid in salt excretion and oxygen uptake. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sarcocornia blackiana plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
