<p>Schiedea adamantis, commonly known as the Adamant's snowplant, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in high-elevation, moist environments, typically found on windward slopes of HaleakalƒÅ and Mauna Loa. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Schiedea adamantis is considered endangered.</p>
