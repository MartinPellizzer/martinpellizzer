                    <h1>Stenotaenia</h1>
<p>Stenotaenia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. Stenotaenia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to withstand drought conditions. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens.</p>
