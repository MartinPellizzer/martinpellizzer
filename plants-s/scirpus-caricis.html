<p>Scirpus caricis, commonly known as the greater bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in wetland environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus caricis is well adapted to moist conditions and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
