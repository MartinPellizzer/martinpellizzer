                    <h1>Salix ligustrina</h1>
<p>Salix ligustrina, commonly known as the Chinese willow or black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and dark, shiny leaves that are lance-shaped and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix ligustrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
