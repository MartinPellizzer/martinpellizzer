                    <h1>Stephanotella</h1>
<p>Stephanotella, commonly known as the star-shaped lichen, is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are composite life forms consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. They are characterized by their crust-like growth form and often exhibit a distinctive star-shaped or reticulate pattern on their surface. Stephanotella species are commonly found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>They play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
