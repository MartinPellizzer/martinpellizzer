                    <h1>Salix prinoides</h1>
<p>Salix prinoides, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
