<p>Spiranthes alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's spirea, is a rare orchid species native to the coastal dunes of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
