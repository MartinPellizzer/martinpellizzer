<p>Salix cordata var. myricoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful form and the soft, silvery foliage that provides visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
