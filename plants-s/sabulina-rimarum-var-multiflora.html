<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on slopes or among rocks. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
