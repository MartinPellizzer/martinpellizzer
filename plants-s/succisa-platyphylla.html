                    <h1>Succisa platyphylla</h1>
<p>Succisa platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf succis, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Succisa platyphylla is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
