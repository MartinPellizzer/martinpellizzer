<p>Setaria aurea subsp.</p>
<p>palustris, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, thriving in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear golden to brown bracts. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
