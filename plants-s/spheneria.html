<p>Spheneria, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, herbaceous plants belonging to the order Sphenophyta.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on the stems. Spheneria species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They have a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and are considered ancient plants.</p>
<p>Despite their small size, they play an important role in soil stabilization and as habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
