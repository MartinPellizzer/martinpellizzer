                    <h1>Selago aspera</h1>
<p>Selago aspera, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots form a dense mat that stabilizes sandy soils, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Selago aspera is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
