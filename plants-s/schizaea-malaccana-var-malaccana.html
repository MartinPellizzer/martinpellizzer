                    <h1>Schizaea malaccana var. malaccana</h1>
<p>Schizaea malaccana var. malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca clubmoss, is a terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms.</p>
