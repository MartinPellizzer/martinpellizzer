                    <h1>Siphocampylus clotho var. calvescens</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus clotho var. calvescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the trunks or branches of trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are long and narrow, often clustering at the base, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
