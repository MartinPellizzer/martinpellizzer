<p>Staurogyne macclellandii, commonly known as the MacClelland's water starwort, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant features a rosette-like arrangement of leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Staurogyne macclellandii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
