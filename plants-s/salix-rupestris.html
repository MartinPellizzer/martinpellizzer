                    <h1>Salix rupestris</h1>
<p>Salix rupestris, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
