                    <h1>Saxifraga arinae</h1>
<p>Saxifraga arinae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, dark green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and talus slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
