                    <h1>Strychnos roborans</h1>
<p>Strychnos roborans, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. Its berries are an important food source for certain birds, which help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and livestock.</p>
