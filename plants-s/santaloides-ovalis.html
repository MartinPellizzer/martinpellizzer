                    <h1>Santaloides ovalis</h1>
<p>Santaloides ovalis, commonly known as the oval sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for its nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat its fruit, which is fleshy and sometimes edible.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
