                    <h1>Sparganium simplex var. androgyna</h1>
<p>Sparganium simplex var. androgyna, commonly known as the male sedge, is a variant of the common sedge that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are predominantly male, hence its common name. It is often found growing alongside its female counterpart, Sparganium simplex, in the same habitat.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in this variant lies in its sexual dimorphism and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
