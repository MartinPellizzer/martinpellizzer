                    <h1>Sanicula</h1>
<p>Sanicula, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to greenish-yellow. Sanicula species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They produce small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse their seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
