<p>Sempervivum arachnoideum subsp.</p>
<p>doellianum, commonly known as the Woolly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively low maintenance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
