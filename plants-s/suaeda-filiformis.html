<p>Suaeda filiformis, commonly known as the slender saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers, which are adapted to thrive in saline and drought conditions. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, desert environments.</p>
<p>Suaeda filiformis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
