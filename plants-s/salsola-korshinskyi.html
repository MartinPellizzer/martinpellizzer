<p>Salsola korshinskyi, commonly known as Russian thorn, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is often found in desert steppes and saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>Salsola korshinskyi is also used in some traditional medicinal practices.</p>
