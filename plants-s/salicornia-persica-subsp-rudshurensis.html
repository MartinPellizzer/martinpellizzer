<p>Salicornia persica subsp.</p>
<p>rudshurensis, commonly known as Persian glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range.</p>
