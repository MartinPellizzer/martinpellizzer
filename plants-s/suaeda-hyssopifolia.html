<p>Suaeda hyssopifolia, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Suaeda hyssopifolia is adapted to tolerate high salinity and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
