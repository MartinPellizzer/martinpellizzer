                    <h1>Susanna dinteri</h1>
<p>Susanna dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, almost ethereal fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Susanna dinteri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
