<p>Senecio schoenleinii, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Senecio schoenleinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
