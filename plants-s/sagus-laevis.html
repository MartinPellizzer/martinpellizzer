                    <h1>Sagus laevis</h1>
<p>Sagus laevis, commonly known as the smooth saguaro, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered with a smooth, waxy surface, distinguishing it from other saguaro species. The plant has a unique ability to store large amounts of water in its thick, succulent stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Sagus laevis produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a keystone species in desert ecosystems.</p>
