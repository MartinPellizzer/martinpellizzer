                    <h1>Stapelia vaga</h1>
<p>Stapelia vaga, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in the evening. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Stapelia vaga is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
