                    <h1>Sagittaria ranunculoides</h1>
<p>Sagittaria ranunculoides, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the submerged soil. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that rise above the water, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sagittaria ranunculoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
