                    <h1>Salvia rupestris</h1>
<p>Salvia rupestris, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Salvia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
