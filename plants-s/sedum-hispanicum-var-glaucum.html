<p>Sedum hispanicum var. glaucum, commonly known as the Spanish stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates.</p>
