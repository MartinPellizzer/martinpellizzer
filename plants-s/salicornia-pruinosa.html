                    <h1>Salicornia pruinosa</h1>
<p>Salicornia pruinosa, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or reddish and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Salicornia pruinosa is an important species for both ecological and commercial purposes, including use in gourmet cuisine and as a natural indicator of salt content in soils.</p>
