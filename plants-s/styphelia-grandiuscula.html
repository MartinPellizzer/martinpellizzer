<p>Styphelia grandiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths.</p>
<p>Styphelia grandiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens.</p>
