                    <h1>Spiranthes actinosophila</h1>
<p>Spiranthes actinosophila, commonly known as the starry spire orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas.</p>
