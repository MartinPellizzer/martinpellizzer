                    <h1>Salix aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Salix aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Nile Valley and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils. It has been historically used for its ornamental value and for its flexible branches, which were used in basket-making.</p>
<p>Salix aegyptiaca is also noted for its role in stabilizing riverbanks due to its extensive root system.</p>
