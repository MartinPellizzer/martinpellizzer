                    <h1>Salsola × gobicola</h1>
<p>Salsola × gobicola, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a hybrid halophyte native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its sprawling growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by both wind and animals. Salsola × gobicola thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered invasive in regions outside its native range.</p>
