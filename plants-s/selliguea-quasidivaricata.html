<p>Selliguea quasidivaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and closely appressed to the substrate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its morphology includes closely spaced, linear leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like structure.</p>
<p>Selliguea quasidivaricata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates.</p>
