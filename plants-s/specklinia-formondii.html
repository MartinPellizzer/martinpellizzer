<p>Specklinia formondii, commonly known as the Formondii orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Specklinia formondii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
