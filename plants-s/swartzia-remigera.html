                    <h1>Swartzia remigera</h1>
<p>Swartzia remigera, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Swartzia remigera is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
