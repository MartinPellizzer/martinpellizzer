                    <h1>Senecio bangii</h1>
<p>Senecio bangii, commonly known as the blue ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a low-maintenance garden plant.</p>
