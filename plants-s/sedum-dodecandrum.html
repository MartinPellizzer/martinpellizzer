                    <h1>Sedum dodecandrum</h1>
<p>Sedum dodecandrum, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late winter or early spring, often around Christmas, hence its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Sedum dodecandrum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
