                    <h1>Salix fulcrata subglauca</h1>
<p>Salix fulcrata subglauca, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a grayish-white bloom. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet, temperate climates and contribute to its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
