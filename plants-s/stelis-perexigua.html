<p>Stelis perexigua, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
