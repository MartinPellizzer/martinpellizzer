                    <h1>Sporobolus filiformis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus filiformis, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Sporobolus filiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
