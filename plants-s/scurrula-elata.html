                    <h1>Scurrula elata</h1>
<p>Scurrula elata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Scurrula elata is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
