                    <h1>Spathelia</h1>
<p>Spathelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on epiphytic growth habits to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Spathelia has small, scale-like leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
