                    <h1>Saxifraga aspera var. bryoides</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aspera var. bryoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its closely packed, moss-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture and withstand extreme weather conditions.</p>
