<p>Seddera repens, commonly known as creeping seddera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Seddera repens is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
