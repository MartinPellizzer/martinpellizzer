<p>Stellaria longipes subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as the sand starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, star-shaped white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is often found in coastal dunes, dry meadows, and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing loose soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological resilience and is sometimes used in habitat restoration projects.</p>
