                    <h1>Sorghum newtonii</h1>
<p>Sorghum newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its deep root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bract-like leaves, and its seeds are encased in hard, fibrous hulls. It is often found in rocky soils and can contribute to soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Despite its hardiness, it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes.</p>
