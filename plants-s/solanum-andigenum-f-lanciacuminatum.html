<p>Solanum andigenum f. lanciacuminatum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a botanical variant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. Its fruit, a small, fleshy berry, is edible but contains toxic alkaloids, making it important to handle with care.</p>
