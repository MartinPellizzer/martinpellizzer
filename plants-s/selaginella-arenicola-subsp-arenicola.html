<p>Selaginella arenicola subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as the sand sprout, is a small, evergreen moss-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tightly clustered, spire-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a thick cuticle and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
