<p>Seutera maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Seutera maritima is well adapted to maritime climates and is often found growing on dunes or rocky shores.</p>
