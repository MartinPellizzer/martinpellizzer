<p>Sideroxylon gardnerianum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-surfaced ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and durable wood, it is valued for both ornamental and practical uses.</p>
