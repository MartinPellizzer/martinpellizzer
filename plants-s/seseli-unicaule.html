<p>Seseli unicaule, commonly known as the single-stem seseli, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its single, upright stem. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, known as an umbel. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seseli unicaule is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
