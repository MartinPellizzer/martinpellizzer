                            <h1>Styloncerus</h1>
<p>Styloncerus is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Staphylinidae, commonly known as rove beetles. These small insects are often found in moist environments such as leaf litter, soil, and under rocks. They play an important role in ecosystems by contributing to decomposition and nutrient cycling. Despite their modest size, Styloncerus species exhibit a variety of morphological adaptations suited to their habitats. Studying these beetles offers insights into biodiversity and ecological interactions in understudied environments.</p>
