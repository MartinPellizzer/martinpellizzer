<p>Sphenopholis obtusata subsp.</p>
<p>lobata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sphenophyllum, is a rare fern-like plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Sphenophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
