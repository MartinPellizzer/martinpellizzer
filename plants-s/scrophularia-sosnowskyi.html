The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and requires specific soil conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
