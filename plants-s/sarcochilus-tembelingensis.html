<p>Sarcochilus tembelingensis, commonly known as the Tembeling sarcocarp, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments within montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
