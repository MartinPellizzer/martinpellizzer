<p>Sedum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a tight rosette, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum compactum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in gardens.</p>
