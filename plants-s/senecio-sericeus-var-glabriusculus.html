<p>Senecio sericeus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the silky blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, woolly texture due to its fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in arid regions.</p>
