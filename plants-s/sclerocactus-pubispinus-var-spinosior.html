                    <h1>Sclerocactus pubispinus var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus pubispinus var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a compact, cylindrical cactus with a dense covering of spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray stem. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
