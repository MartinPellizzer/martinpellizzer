                    <h1>Setaria gigantea</h1>
<p>Setaria gigantea, commonly known as giant foxtail, is a grass species native to Africa but now widely naturalized in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>It is a tall, annual plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes and tillers allow it to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
