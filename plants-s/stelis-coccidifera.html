<p>Stelis coccidifera, commonly known as the coral-tipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, stout stem with a dense cluster of small, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Stelis coccidifera is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
