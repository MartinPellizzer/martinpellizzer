                    <h1>Sedum pilosum</h1>
<p>Sedum pilosum, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, low-moisture conditions.</p>
