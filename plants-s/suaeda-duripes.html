<p>Suaeda duripes, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Suaeda duripes is adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
