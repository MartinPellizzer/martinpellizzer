                    <h1>Spiranthes sinensis f. autumnus</h1>
<p>Spiranthes sinensis f. autumnus, commonly known as the autumn spire orchid, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that produces delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences of white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form a dense underground network, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
