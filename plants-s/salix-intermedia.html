                    <h1>Salix intermedia</h1>
<p>Salix intermedia, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves of Salix intermedia have been used historically in traditional medicine for their mild salicin content, similar to aspirin.</p>
