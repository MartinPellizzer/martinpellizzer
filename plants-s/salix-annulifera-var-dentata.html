<p>Salix annulifera var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that have serrated edges, giving it its specific epithet "dentata.". The plant typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix annulifera var. dentata is often smooth and pale, with some varieties showing a reddish or grayish hue.</p>
