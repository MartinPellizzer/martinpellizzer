<p>Stipa pennata subsp.</p>
<p>dvorakii, commonly known as the Dvorak's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, wind-swaying appearance.</p>
