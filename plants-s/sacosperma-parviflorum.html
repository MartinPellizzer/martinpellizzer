<p>Sacosperma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered sacosperma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves.

The fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, which is enclosed in a hard, woody endocarp.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
