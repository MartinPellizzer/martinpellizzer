<p>Secale dighoricum, commonly known as the Dighori rye, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers.
