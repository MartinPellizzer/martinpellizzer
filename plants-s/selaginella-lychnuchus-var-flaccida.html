                    <h1>Selaginella lychnuchus var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Selaginella lychnuchus var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are often a dark green color. It produces strobila (spore-bearing structures) that are clustered at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to survive in humid conditions and its unique morphology that resembles both mosses and ferns.</p>
