                    <h1>Saussurea alpina var. densa</h1>
<p>Saussurea alpina var. densa, commonly known as the dense alpine saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of yellow-orange flower heads, which resemble small saffron threads. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
