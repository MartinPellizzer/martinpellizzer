<p>Senecio oblanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf groundsel, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oblong leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
