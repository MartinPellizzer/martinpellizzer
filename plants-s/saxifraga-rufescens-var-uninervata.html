<p>Saxifraga rufescens var. uninervata, commonly known as the red sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a hardy and visually appealing choice for xeriscaping.</p>
