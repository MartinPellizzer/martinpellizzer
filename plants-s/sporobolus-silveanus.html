                    <h1>Sporobolus silveanus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus silveanus, commonly known as silverleaf grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
