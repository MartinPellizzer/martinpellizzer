                    <h1>Sphaeroma umbellatum</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like shell that encases its soft body. The plant-like appearance of the shell is a key botanical feature, though it is not a true plant but a mollusk. Its morphology includes a radula for feeding on algae, and it plays a role in marine ecosystems by grazing on microscopic algae.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to secrete a calcareous shell, which is a unique adaptation in the sea hare family.</p>
