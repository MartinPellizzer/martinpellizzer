<p>Sarcopodium verruciferum, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Sarcopodium verruciferum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrition.</p>
