                    <h1>Salix caprea var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Salix caprea var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. Its small, catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
