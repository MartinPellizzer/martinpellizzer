<p>Spiranthes sunii, commonly known as the sun spire orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
