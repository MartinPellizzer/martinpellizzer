<p>Salix triandra var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, often weeping branches and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinct variation in color and shape, giving rise to its varietal name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
