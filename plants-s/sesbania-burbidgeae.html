                    <h1>Sesbania burbidgeae</h1>
<p>Sesbania burbidgeae, commonly known as the Burridge's sesbania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas due to its ability to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>The seeds are typically dispersed by animals, aiding in the plant's spread across its native range.</p>
