                    <h1>Sclerochloa rigida var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa rigida var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green colored leaves that are coated with a waxy layer, providing protection against desiccation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
