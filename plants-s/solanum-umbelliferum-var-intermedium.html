<p>Solanum umbelliferum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces purple-black berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>
