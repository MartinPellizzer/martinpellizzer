                    <h1>Saxifraga penduliflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Saxifraga penduliflora is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
