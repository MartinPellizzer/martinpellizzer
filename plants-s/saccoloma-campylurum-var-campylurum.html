<p>Saccoloma campylurum var. campylurum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed saccoloma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
