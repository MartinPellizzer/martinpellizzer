                    <h1>Schiedeella dressleri</h1>
<p>Schiedeella dressleri, commonly known as the Darwin's ghost, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped with a leathery texture. Schiedeella dressleri is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides insights into the adaptive strategies of rainforest flora.</p>
