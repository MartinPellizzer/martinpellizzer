                    <h1>Styphelia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Styphelia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its pale blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Styphelia fasciculata is often used in rock gardens and as a specimen plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
