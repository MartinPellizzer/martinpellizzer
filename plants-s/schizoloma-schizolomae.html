                    <h1>Schizoloma schizolomae</h1>
<p>Schizoloma schizolomae, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its evocative common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring high humidity and shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural environment.</p>
