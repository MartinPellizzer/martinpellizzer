<p>Sphondylium gummiferum, commonly known as the gummed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the genus Sphondylium.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
