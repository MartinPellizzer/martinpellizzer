                    <h1>Sium paniculatum</h1>
<p>Sium paniculatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in an umbrella-like cluster called an umbel. Its roots are similar to those of parsley and parsnip, though they are less commonly used in cooking.</p>
<p>Sium paniculatum thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
