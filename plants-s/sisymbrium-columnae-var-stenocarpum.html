                    <h1>Sisymbrium columnae var. stenocarpum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium columnae var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-capsule broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its flowering structure known as a scorpioid cyme. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a narrow, elongated pod, which is a distinguishing feature of the variety stenocarpum.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a challenge for agricultural crops due to its parasitic nature.</p>
