<p>Schoenorchis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and rocky areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
