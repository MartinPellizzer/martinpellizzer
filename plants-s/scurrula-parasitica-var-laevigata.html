                    <h1>Scurrula parasitica var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Scurrula parasitica var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth scurrula, is a rare and specialized parasitic plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically attaches itself to the roots of other plants, such as Acacia species, through haustoria. Its morphology is characterized by a short, fleshy stem and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
