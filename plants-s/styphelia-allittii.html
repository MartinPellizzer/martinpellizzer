                    <h1>Styphelia allittii</h1>
<p>Styphelia allittii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved winter beauty, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and dark green. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in a tight inflorescence. Styphelia allittii is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with other heathland species, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
