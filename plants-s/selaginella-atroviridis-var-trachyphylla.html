                    <h1>Selaginella atroviridis var. trachyphylla</h1>
<p>Selaginella atroviridis var. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-scaled spikemoss, is a vascular fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often forming dense mats or cushions. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological resilience.</p>
