<p>Scilla odorata f. albida, commonly known as the white scilla, is a botanical variant of the common scilla.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean region. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in the spring.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its pale, almost white flowers, which distinguish it from the more typical blue or violet-colored varieties of Scilla odorata.</p>
