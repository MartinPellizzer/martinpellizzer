<p>Scleranthus cattaroanus, commonly known as the Adriatic sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scleranthus cattaroanus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
