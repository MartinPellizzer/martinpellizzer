                    <h1>Scleroglossum intermedium</h1>
<p>Scleroglossum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hard-shelled lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is notable for its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark brown, with a firm, leathery texture that provides structural support. It contains a complex mixture of fungal and algal components, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives on limestone or other calcareous substrates.</p>
