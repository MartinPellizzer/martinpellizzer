                <h1>Sporobolus virginicus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus virginicus, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate salt spray makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
