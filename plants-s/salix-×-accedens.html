                    <h1>Salix × accedens</h1>
<p>Salix × accedens, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix schwerinii (Schwerin willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by cylindrical fruits that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows.</p>
