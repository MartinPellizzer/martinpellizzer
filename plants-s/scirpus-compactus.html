<p>Scirpus compactus, commonly known as the compact tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and typically grows in clusters, forming tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown flowers in spikes during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus compactus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
