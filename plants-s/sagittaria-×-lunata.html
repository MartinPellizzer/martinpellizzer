<p>Sagittaria × lunata, commonly known as the water arrowhead, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Sagittaria × lunata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
