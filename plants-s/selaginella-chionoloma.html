<p>Selaginella chionoloma, commonly known as the snow moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-lying mats. The plant has a unique structure with closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are found on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Selaginella chionoloma is adapted to cold, dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
