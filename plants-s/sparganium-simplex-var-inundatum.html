                    <h1>Sparganium simplex var. inundatum</h1>
<p>Sparganium simplex var. inundatum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its distinctive, narrow, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>It is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and support biodiversity.</p>
