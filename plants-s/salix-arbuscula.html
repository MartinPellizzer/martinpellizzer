                    <h1>Salix arbuscula</h1>
<p>Salix arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Salix arbuscula typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
