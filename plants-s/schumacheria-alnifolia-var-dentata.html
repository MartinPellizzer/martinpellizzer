                    <h1>Schumacheria alnifolia var. dentata</h1>
<p>Schumacheria alnifolia var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced toothed leaf margins compared to the typical form of Schumacheria alnifolia.</p>
