<p>Senecio paludaffinis, commonly known as the bog senecio, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough or hairy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Senecio paludaffinis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects.</p>
