<p>Saxifraga subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. The plant features small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga subspathulata is well adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic species of alpine vegetation.</p>
