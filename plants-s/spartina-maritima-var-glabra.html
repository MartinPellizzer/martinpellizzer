<p>Spartina maritima var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is typically found in coastal marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines.
