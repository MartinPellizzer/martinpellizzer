                    <h1>Sambucus maritima</h1>
<p>Sambucus maritima, commonly known as the common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately arranged with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Sambucus maritima is often found in wetlands, dunes, and along the edges of forests.</p>
