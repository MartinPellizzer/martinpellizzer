<p>Spathodea corymbosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often visible through the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its showy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
