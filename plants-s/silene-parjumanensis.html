<p>Silene parjumanensis, commonly known as the Parjumanensis campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Silene parjumanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
