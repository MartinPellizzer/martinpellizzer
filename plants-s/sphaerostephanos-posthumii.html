                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos posthumii</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos posthumii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense, white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Sphaerostephanos posthumii is considered critically endangered.</p>
