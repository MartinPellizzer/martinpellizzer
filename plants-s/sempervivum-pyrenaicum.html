                    <h1>Sempervivum pyrenaicum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Pyrenees region.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky, alpine environments and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
