<p>Schrankia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican tree fern, is a species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor deeply into the soil, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Schrankia portoricensis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
