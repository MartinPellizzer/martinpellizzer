                    <h1>Sedum</h1>
<p>Sedum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a diverse genus of succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Many species of sedum are found in rocky or sandy soils, often growing in crevices or on cliffs. They typically produce clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Sedum species are popular in landscaping due to their low maintenance and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
