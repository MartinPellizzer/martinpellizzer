<p>Serrafalcus chiapporianus, commonly known as the Chiappori's serrated fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, serrated fronds that resemble a delicate lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Serrafalcus chiapporianus is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
