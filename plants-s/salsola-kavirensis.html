<p>Salsola kavirensis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in desert environments where water is scarce. Its adaptations include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Salsola kavirensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing forage for livestock in certain regions.</p>
