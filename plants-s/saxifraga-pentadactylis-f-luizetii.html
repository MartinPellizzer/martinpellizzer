<p>Saxifraga pentadactylis f. luizetii, commonly known as the Luizet's saxifrage, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in clusters at the tips of the stems during late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
