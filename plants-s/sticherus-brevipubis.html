<p>Sticherus brevipubis, commonly known as the short-hairy sticherus, is a small, perennial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate stem with closely spaced, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are usually arranged in two rows. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and develop on the upper surface of the leaves.</p>
<p>Sticherus brevipubis is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of wetland and forest ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
