<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces tall, erect stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Selenipedium × dominianum is a hybrid between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium suavissimum, making it a unique example of natural hybridization in orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly valued in conservation efforts and botanical research.</p>
