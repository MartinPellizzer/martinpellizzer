<p>Sporobolus pulvinatus, commonly known as the bullseagrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a trait that contributes to its adaptability in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus pulvinatus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
