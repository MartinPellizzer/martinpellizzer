                    <h1>Sisymbrium asperum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium asperum, commonly known as hoary broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on a symbiotic relationship with host plants for nutrients. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
