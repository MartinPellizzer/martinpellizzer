                    <h1>Sambucus canadensis</h1>
<p>Sambucus canadensis, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These berries are toxic when raw but can be made safe through proper cooking.</p>
<p>Sambucus canadensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also a valuable food source for birds and wildlife.</p>
