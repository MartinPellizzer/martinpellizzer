                <h1>Shivparvatia melandryiformis</h1>
<p>Shivparvatia melandryiformis, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
