                    <h1>Sorbus aucuparia f. latefoliolata</h1>
<p>Sorbus aucuparia f. latefoliolata, commonly known as the late-leaved whitebeam, is a botanical variant of the common whitebeam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delayed leaf emergence, with foliage appearing later in the growing season compared to the typical form. The leaves are generally larger and have a more elongated shape than those of the standard species. This form is often found in woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique phenological traits and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
