                    <h1>Stelis bermejoensis</h1>
<p>Stelis bermejoensis, commonly known as the Bermejo orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
