                    <h1>Salix tenella var. tenella</h1>
<p>Salix tenella var. tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
