<p>Skimmia arborescens subsp.</p>
<p>nitida, commonly known as silver skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it a striking appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red-orange berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its slow growth and ability to form a neat, compact shape.</p>
