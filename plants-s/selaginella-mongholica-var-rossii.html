                    <h1>Selaginella mongholica var. rossii</h1>
<p>Selaginella mongholica var. rossii, commonly known as the Mongolian spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, which allows it to retain water efficiently. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Selaginella species but is distinguished by specific morphological traits in its leaves and spore structures.</p>
