                    <h1>Salix fimbriata</h1>
<p>Salix fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed along the edges. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is typically found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its fibrous bark and rapid growth make it adaptable to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix fimbriata plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
