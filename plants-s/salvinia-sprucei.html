                    <h1>Salvinia sprucei</h1>
<p>Salvinia sprucei, commonly known as the floating marsh fern, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Salvinia sprucei is native to parts of Africa and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
