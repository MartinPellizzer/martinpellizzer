                    <h1>Synaedrys thomsonii</h1>
<p>Synaedrys thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that bloom briefly during the rainy season. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered threatened in its native range.</p>
