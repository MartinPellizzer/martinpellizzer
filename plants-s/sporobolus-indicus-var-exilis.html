                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus var. exilis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. exilis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted to dry conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil and low moisture environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is used for forage in some regions.</p>
