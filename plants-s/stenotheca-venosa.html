                    <h1>Stenotheca venosa</h1>
<p>Stenotheca venosa, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on these specialized structures for essential nutrients. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Stenotheca venosa exhibits a unique combination of morphological adaptations that enable it to thrive in its specialized aquatic habitat.</p>
