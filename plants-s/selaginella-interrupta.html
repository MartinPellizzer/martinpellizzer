<p>Selaginella interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cone-like structures called strobila that bear spores. Selaginella interrupta is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including periods of drought, due to its specialized adaptations.</p>
