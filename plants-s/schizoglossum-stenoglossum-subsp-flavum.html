<p>Schizoglossum stenoglossum subsp.</p>
<p>flavum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered schizoglossum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the brief alpine growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
