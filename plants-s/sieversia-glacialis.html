                    <h1>Sieversia glacialis</h1>
<p>Sieversia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude environments in the Himalayas and other mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Sieversia glacialis is adapted to harsh climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and visually striking component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
