<p>Senegalia paganuccii, commonly known as the Arizona acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, linear pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Senegalia paganuccii plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
