                    <h1>Stenanthera ericoides</h1>
<p>Stenanthera ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Stenanthera ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
