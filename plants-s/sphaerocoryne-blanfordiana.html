<p>Sphaerocoryne blanfordiana, commonly known as the Blanford's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its native desert environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sphaerocoryne blanfordiana is known for its resilience in harsh, dry conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
