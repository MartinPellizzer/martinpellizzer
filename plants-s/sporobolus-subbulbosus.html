                    <h1>Sporobolus subbulbosus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus subbulbosus, commonly known as the bulboous spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across disturbed and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus subbulbosus is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
