<p>Sorghum × randolphianum, commonly known as the hybrid sorghum, is a sterile interspecific hybrid resulting from the cross between sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of 2 to 4 meters, and its robust, fibrous stalks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a prominent midrib and a rough, hairy surface.</p>
<p>This hybrid is primarily valued for its use in forage production and as a source of biomass for energy crops.</p>
