                    <h1>Stereochilus ringens</h1>
<p>Stereochilus ringens, commonly known as the clustered rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a rosette of fleshy, glabrous leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, recurved petals. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
