                    <h1>Sedum altaicum</h1>
<p>Sedum altaicum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Sedum altaicum is drought-tolerant and hardy, capable of surviving in harsh, cold climates.</p>
