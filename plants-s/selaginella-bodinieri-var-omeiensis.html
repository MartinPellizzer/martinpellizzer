                    <h1>Selaginella bodinieri var. omeiensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella bodinieri var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Mountain spikemoss, is a rare and unique species of spikemoss found primarily in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like sporophytes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for specific microhabitats and its potential ecological importance in maintaining biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
