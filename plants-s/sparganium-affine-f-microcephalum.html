                    <h1>Sparganium affine f. microcephalum</h1>
<p>Sparganium affine f. microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed burr rush, is a rare botanical variant of the burr rush species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescences that are smaller than those of the typical form. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, spiky flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
