<p>Salix laxiflora, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Salix laxiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing desert landscapes.</p>
