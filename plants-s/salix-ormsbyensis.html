                    <h1>Salix ormsbyensis</h1>
<p>Salix ormsbyensis, commonly known as Ormsby's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. Its flowers are catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix ormsbyensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
