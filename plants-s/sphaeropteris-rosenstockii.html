                    <h1>Sphaeropteris rosenstockii</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
