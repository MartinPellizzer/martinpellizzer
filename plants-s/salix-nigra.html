                    <h1>Salix nigra</h1>
<p>Salix nigra, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish when young. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Black willow thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
