<p>Salvia viridis var. comata, commonly known as green salvia or woolly green sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
