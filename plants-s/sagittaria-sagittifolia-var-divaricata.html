                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. divaricata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. divaricata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically broad and green, often floating on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are actually clusters of tiny flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
