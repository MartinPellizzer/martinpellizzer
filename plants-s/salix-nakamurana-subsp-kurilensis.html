<p>Salix nakamurana subsp.</p>
<p>kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril willow, is a shrub native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of willow species, which contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
