<p>Smilax velutina, commonly known as the velvet arrowhead, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem with persistent, waxy, and often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall.</p>
<p>Smilax velutina is characterized by its ability to climb using modified stems called tendrils, which help it reach sunlight in dense woodland environments.</p>
