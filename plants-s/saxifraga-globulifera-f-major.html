                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera f. major</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera f. major, commonly known as the giant globe saxifrage, is a rare and striking alpine plant characterized by its large, rounded, fleshy leaves and showy pink to purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant's leaves are typically clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette that helps conserve moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
