<p>Schoenoplectiella, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. They are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Schoenoplectiella species often play a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions makes them important components of wetland ecosystems.</p>
