<p>Sanguisorba baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Sanguisorba baicalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
