<p>Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. laui, commonly known as the Tiraqu√©n Cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It features a cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange-red, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
