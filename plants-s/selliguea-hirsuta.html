                    <h1>Selliguea hirsuta</h1>
<p>Selliguea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a member of the Pterobranchiata order and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. The plant's fronds are usually spirally arranged and have a leathery texture, with small, scale-like leaves. Selliguea hirsuta reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
