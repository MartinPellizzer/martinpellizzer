<p>Schoenus inexpansus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help in vegetative propagation.</p>
