                    <h1>Senecio napaeifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio napaeifolius, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Senecio napaeifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
