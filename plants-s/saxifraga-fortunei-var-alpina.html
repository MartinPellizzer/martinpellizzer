<p>Saxifraga fortunei var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga fortunei var. alpina is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
