                    <h1>Sequoiadendron giganteum f. pendulum</h1>
<p>Sequoiadendron giganteum f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping giant sequoia, is a unique variant of the coast redwood.</p>
<p>It features long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, distinguishing it from the typical upright form of the species. This form is a natural mutation that occurs in certain populations, often found in moist, shaded environments. The foliage remains dense and green, maintaining the characteristic appearance of the species.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta for its ornamental value and ecological interest.</p>
