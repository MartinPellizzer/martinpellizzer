<p>Spathoglottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. They are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Australia. Spathoglottis species typically have dark green, strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are considered endangered.</p>
