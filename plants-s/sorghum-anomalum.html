<p>Sorghum anomalum, commonly known as the strange sorghum, is a lesser-known species within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, often irregular growth patterns. The plant typically features tall, slender stalks with narrow leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. While not widely cultivated for food, it has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of biofuel.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for research into plant adaptation and resilience.</p>
