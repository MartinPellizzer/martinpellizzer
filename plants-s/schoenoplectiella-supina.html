<p>Schoenoplectiella supina, commonly known as the flat-topped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers arranged in a flat, spike-like inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectiella supina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
