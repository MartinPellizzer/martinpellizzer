                <h1>Setaria viridis</h1>
<p>Setaria viridis, commonly known as green foxtail, is a grass species native to Africa and widely cultivated as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, green bracts that contain the reproductive structures. Setaria viridis is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate and genetic simplicity make it an important subject for studying plant development and stress responses.</p>
