                    <h1>Saxifraga dichotoma</h1>
<p>Saxifraga dichotoma, commonly known as the forked saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saxifraga dichotoma thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
