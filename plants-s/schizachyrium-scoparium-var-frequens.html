                    <h1>Schizachyrium scoparium var. frequens</h1>
<p>Schizachyrium scoparium var. frequens, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades.</p>
<p>It produces feathery panicles of small, light green to golden flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. This variety is more densely tufted than the typical form, making it a desirable ornamental in native plant gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in restoration projects.</p>
