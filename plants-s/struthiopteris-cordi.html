<p>Struthiopteris cordi, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
