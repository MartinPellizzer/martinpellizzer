<p>Spilotantha staaliana, commonly known as the St. Helena dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and has adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Spilotantha staaliana is of particular interest to botanists due to its endemic status and its role in the island's fragile ecosystem.</p>
