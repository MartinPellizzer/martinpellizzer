                    <h1>Steudelia</h1>
<p>Steudelia, commonly known as the "false hibiscus," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers and are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. Steudelia species typically have hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. They often grow in disturbed soils and can be found in habitats such as roadsides, deserts, and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Steudelia malacanthus and Steudelia arizonica, which are adapted to harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
