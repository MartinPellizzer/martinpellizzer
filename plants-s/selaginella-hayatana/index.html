                            <h1>Selaginella Hayatana</h1>
<p>Whisk fern, scientifically known as Selaginella hayatana, is a unique and ancient plant that belongs to the spore-bearing group of plants called lycophytes. Found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its name comes from the delicate, hair-like structures that resemble whisk bristles, giving it a distinctive and almost otherworldly appearance. Despite its primitive appearance, the whisk fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and supporting diverse microflora. With its fascinating biology and striking form, the whisk fern offers a glimpse into the evolutionary history of plant life on Earth.</p>
