<p>Solidago virgaurea subsp.</p>
<p>alpestris, commonly known as alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
