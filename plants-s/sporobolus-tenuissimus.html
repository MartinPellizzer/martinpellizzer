                    <h1>Sporobolus tenuissimus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus tenuissimus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
