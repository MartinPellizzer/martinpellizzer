<p>Sideroxylon bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in dry to semi-arid regions and has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or yellow and are followed by small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species.</p>
