                    <h1>Schoenus tenuiflorus</h1>
<p>Schoenus tenuiflorus, commonly known as slender-flowered couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Despite its modest appearance, Schoenus tenuiflorus plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates.</p>
