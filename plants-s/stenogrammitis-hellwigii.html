<p>Stenogrammitis hellwigii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stenogrammitis, is a rare fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
