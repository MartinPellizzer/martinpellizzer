                    <h1>Spergula salina</h1>
<p>Spergula salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, grass-like appearance with narrow, needle-like leaves adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a feature common among the grass family. Spergula salina is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other areas with high salinity, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
