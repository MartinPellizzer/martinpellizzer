                    <h1>Sporobolus tsiafajavonensis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus tsiafajavonensis, commonly known as the Madagascar grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stem, with small, pale green to brown florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought resistance.</p>
<p>Sporobolus tsiafajavonensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
