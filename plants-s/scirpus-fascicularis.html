<p>Scirpus fascicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.
