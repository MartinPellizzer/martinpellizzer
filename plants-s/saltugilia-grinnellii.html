                    <h1>Saltugilia grinnellii</h1>
<p>Saltugilia grinnellii, commonly known as the Grinnell's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to access deep water sources, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Saltugilia grinnellii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
