                    <h1>Santalum myrtifolium</h1>
<p>Santalum myrtifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Santalum myrtifolium is also a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system.</p>
