<p>Saussurea yanagisawae var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yewgrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
