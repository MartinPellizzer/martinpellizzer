<p>Sporobolus commutatus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant has a clumping growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus commutatus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
