                    <h1>Strobus monticola</h1>
<p>Strobus monticola, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in many areas.</p>
