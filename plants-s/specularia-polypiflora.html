<p>Specularia polypiflora, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings.</p>
