<p>Spathicarpa tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's spathicarpa, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated bract that encloses the flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>
