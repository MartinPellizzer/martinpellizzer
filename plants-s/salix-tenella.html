                    <h1>Salix tenella</h1>
<p>Salix tenella, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and slender, willow-like branches that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Salix tenella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
