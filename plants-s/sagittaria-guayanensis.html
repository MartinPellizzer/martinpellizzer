<p>Sagittaria guayanensis, commonly known as the Guayana arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the submerged soil. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in the late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Sagittaria guayanensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
