                    <h1>Stenophyllus floridanus</h1>
<p>Stenophyllus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida panhandle fern, is a unique fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare and ecologically significant plant is an important indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
