                    <h1>Stipagrostis schaeferi</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis schaeferi, commonly known as the Schaefer's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in low, dense tussocks and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy component of steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
