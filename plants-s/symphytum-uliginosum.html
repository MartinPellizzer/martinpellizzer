                    <h1>Symphytum uliginosum</h1>
<p>Symphytum uliginosum, commonly known as the common comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tall spikes of blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its roots contain allantoin, a compound known for its healing properties, making it historically valuable in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
