<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often considered an indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
