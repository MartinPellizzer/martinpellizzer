<p>Secale strictum subsp.</p>
<p>anatolicum, commonly known as the Anatolian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
