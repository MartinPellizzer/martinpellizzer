<p>Struthiopteris filiformis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of tissue, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
