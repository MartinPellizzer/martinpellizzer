<p>Spergella caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted liverwort, is a type of moss-like plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Spergella caespitosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
