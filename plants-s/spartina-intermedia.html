                    <h1>Spartina intermedia</h1>
<p>Spartina intermedia, commonly known as cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. This plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Spartina intermedia is also known for its ability to form dense stands, which can outcompete native vegetation in some cases.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes spread rapidly, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly and adapt to varying environmental conditions.</p>
