<p>Spaniopappus hygrophilus, commonly known as the marsh hound, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal water levels, and it often blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
