                    <h1>Senecio cyrenaicus</h1>
<p>Senecio cyrenaicus, commonly known as the desert groundsels, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to hot, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio cyrenaicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
