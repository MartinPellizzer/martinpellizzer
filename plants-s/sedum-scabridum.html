<p>Sedum scabridum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
<p>Sedum scabridum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
