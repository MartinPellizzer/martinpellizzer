<p>Solea anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that form dense mats on the water's surface. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinctive serrated edge.</p>
