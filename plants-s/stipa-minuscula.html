                    <h1>Stipa minuscula</h1>
<p>Stipa minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a small perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, featuring slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and hardy nature, it is an important component of high-altitude vegetation.</p>
