                    <h1>Stylosanthes hispida var. erecta</h1>
<p>Stylosanthes hispida var. erecta, commonly known as hairy stylosanthes, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by cylindrical pods containing small, oval seeds. It is widely used as a forage crop and for soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to poor soils makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
