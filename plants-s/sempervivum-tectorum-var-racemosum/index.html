                            <h1>Sempervivum Tectorum Var. Racemosum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum tectorum var. racemosum is a hardy succulent known for its compact growth and vibrant foliage. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Its rosette-shaped leaves are typically green with red or purple hues, especially during cooler seasons. The plant is also called the "hen and chickens" due to its tendency to produce offsets. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
