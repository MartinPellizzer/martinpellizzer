                    <h1>Sagina schiraevskii</h1>
<p>Sagina schiraevskii, commonly known as the mountain sagina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces tiny white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
