<p>Salix curtiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix curtiflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
