                    <h1>Strychnos potatorum</h1>
<p>Strychnos potatorum, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule and contain toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine, though it has been used in some cultures for its purported medicinal effects.</p>
