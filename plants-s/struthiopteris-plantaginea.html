<p>Struthiopteris plantaginea, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a continuous line along the underside of the fronds.</p>
