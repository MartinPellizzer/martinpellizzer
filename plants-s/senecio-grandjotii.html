                    <h1>Senecio grandjotii</h1>
<p>Senecio grandjotii, commonly known as the desert groundsels, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio grandjotii is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats.</p>
