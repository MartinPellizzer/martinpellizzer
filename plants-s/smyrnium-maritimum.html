                    <h1>Smyrnium maritimum</h1>
<p>Smyrnium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along the shorelines. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiky pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Smyrnium maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
