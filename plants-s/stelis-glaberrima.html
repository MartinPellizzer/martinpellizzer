                    <h1>Stelis glaberrima</h1>
<p>Stelis glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous stelis, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, often branched stem with dense, fleshy leaves that help store water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>
<p>Stelis glaberrima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
