<p>Solanum armatum var. cultum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
