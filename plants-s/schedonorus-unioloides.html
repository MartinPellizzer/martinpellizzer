                    <h1>Schedonorus unioloides</h1>
<p>Schedonorus unioloides, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that are often used in turfgrass applications.</p>
<p>Schedonorus unioloides is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is tolerant of both drought and shade.</p>
