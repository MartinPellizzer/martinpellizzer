                    <h1>Sisymbrium ramosum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium ramosum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant has small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes and lacks true leaves, relying on its host for photosynthesis. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and parasitic plant studies.</p>
