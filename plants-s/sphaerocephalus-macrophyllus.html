                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that form a dense, cup-like structure, which helps retain moisture and provides a habitat for small organisms. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Its unique morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of study in tropical ecology.</p>
<p>The species plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
