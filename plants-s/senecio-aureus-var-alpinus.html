                    <h1>Senecio aureus var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Senecio aureus var. alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine Golden Groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and striking color make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
