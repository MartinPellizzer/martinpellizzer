                    <h1>Setaria scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Setaria scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is not native.</p>
