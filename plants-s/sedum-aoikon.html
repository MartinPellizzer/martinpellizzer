The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in the summer months. It is often used in landscaping for its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sedum aoikon is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
