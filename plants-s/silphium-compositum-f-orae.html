                    <h1>Silphium compositum f. orae</h1>
<p>Silphium compositum f. orae, commonly known as the coastal silphium, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth form and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, salty soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
