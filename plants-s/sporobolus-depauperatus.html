                    <h1>Sporobolus depauperatus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus depauperatus, commonly known as the poor grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a deep, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus depauperatus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
