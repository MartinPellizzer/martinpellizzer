                            <h1>Schoenus Polycephalus</h1>
<p>Tufted sedge, scientifically known as Schoenus polycephalus, is a distinctive grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is recognized for its unique appearance, featuring dense clusters of grass-like leaves that form tufts at the base. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands and grassy areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping. Despite its beauty, it plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>
