                    <h1>Seymeria coahuilana</h1>
<p>Seymeria coahuilana, commonly known as the Coahuilan seymaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring season. Seymeria coahuilana is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
