                    <h1>Stachys palustris var. cordata</h1>
<p>Stachys palustris var. cordata, commonly known as marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs and lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in whorled patterns along the stem. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
