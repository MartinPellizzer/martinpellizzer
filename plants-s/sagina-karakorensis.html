                    <h1>Sagina karakorensis</h1>
<p>Sagina karakorensis, commonly known as the Karakoram sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, which bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme cold make it well adapted to its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Sagina karakorensis is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
