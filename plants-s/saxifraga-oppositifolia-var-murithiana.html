                    <h1>Saxifraga oppositifolia var. murithiana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia var. murithiana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, such as rocky soils and tundra, where it forms dense cushions to protect itself from extreme cold and wind. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is a key component of polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
