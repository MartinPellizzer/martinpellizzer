                    <h1>Selaginella orbignyana</h1>
<p>Selaginella orbignyana, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen, spore-bearing plant that can survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of cryptobiosis. When rehydrated, it rapidly regains its turgor and green color, giving it its common name. The plant has a rosette-like structure with closely packed, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to survive desiccation makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and applications in biotechnology.</p>
