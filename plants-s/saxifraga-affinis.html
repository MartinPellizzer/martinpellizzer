<p>Saxifraga affinis, commonly known as the stonecrop or mountain saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Saxifraga affinis is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to withstand frost and drought.</p>
