                    <h1>Stelis lauta</h1>
<p>Stelis lauta, commonly known as the broad-leafed stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that can reach several feet in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Stelis lauta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
