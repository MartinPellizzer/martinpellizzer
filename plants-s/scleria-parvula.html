                    <h1>Scleria parvula</h1>
<p>Scleria parvula, commonly known as the small bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds or in swampy areas. Its small, three-lobed flowers are often clustered at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse via wind or water.</p>
<p>Scleria parvula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in wetland habitats.</p>
