                    <h1>Sesleria caerulea var. ratzeburgii</h1>
<p>Sesleria caerulea var. ratzeburgii, commonly known as the blue sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color, which is a result of the plant's high concentration of anthocyanins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact clumps.</p>
