                    <h1>Sericotheca</h1>
<p>Sericotheca, commonly known as the silky sheath, is a specialized structure found in certain fungal spore cases.</p>
<p>It is typically composed of a thin, membranous layer that encases the spores, providing protection and aiding in their dispersal. The sericotheca is often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss and increase durability. This structure is particularly common in members of the family Helotiaceae.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role in spore survival and ecological adaptation.</p>
