<p>Schoberia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>

The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
