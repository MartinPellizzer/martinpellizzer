The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
