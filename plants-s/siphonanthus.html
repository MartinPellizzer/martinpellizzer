                    <h1>Siphonanthus</h1>
<p>Siphonanthus, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Siphonanthus species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling daisies. The leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
