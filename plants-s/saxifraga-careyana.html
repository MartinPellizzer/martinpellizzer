                    <h1>Saxifraga careyana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga careyana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga careyana is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
