                    <h1>Scytopetalum</h1>
<p>Scytopetalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly figure, hence its common name. Scytopetalum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
