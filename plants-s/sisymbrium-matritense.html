                    <h1>Sisymbrium matritense</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium matritense, commonly known as the Madrid broomrape, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually reduced to small scales. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
