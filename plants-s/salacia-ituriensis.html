                    <h1>Salacia ituriensis</h1>
<p>Salacia ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri salacia, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it exhibits unique adaptations to its humid, tropical environment. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and green. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salacia ituriensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
