                    <h1>Sphenostigma longispatha</h1>
<p>Sphenostigma longispatha, commonly known as the long-spined sphenostigma, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology, including long, spiny bracts, helps distinguish it from other species in the genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
