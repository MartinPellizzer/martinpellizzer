                    <h1>Scirpus berlandieri</h1>
<p>Scirpus berlandieri, commonly known as the Texas bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that form a tall, grass-like structure. The plant thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus berlandieri plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
