<p>Sphaerostigma implexum, commonly known as the entwined globe moss, is a rare and delicate species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are spherical and contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Sphaerostigma implexum is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
