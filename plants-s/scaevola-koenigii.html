                    <h1>Scaevola koenigii</h1>
<p>Scaevola koenigii, commonly known as the coastal scabious, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a common sight along beaches and dunes.</p>
<p>Scaevola koenigii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
