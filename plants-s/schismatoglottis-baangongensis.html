                    <h1>Schismatoglottis baangongensis</h1>
<p>Schismatoglottis baangongensis, commonly known as the Baangong orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant pink or purple hues with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schismatoglottis baangongensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
