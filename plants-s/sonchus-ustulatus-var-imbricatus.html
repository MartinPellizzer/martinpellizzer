                    <h1>Sonchus ustulatus var. imbricatus</h1>
<p>Sonchus ustulatus var. imbricatus, commonly known as the roughleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, which are surrounded by bracts that are often glandular and hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
