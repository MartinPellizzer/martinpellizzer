                    <h1>Solidago arenicola</h1>
<p>Solidago arenicola, commonly known as sandplain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in open, disturbed areas such as dunes and roadsides. The plant produces showy, yellow inflorescences in late summer and early autumn, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sandplain goldenrod plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
