<p>Spiranthes congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered spire orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, spiraling clusters of white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
