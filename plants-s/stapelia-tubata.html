                    <h1>Stapelia tubata</h1>
<p>Stapelia tubata, commonly known as the tubular stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants.</p>
<p>Stapelia tubata is often grown as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
