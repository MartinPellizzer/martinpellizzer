<p>Sedum maurum, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, depending on the variety. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments due to its ability to store water in its leaves.</p>
<p>Sedum maurum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover because of its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
