                    <h1>Saxifraga chumbiensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga chumbiensis, commonly known as the Chumbi saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on steep slopes and cliffs. The plant features basal leaves that are rhombic or ovate in shape, with a hairy texture adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Saxifraga chumbiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
