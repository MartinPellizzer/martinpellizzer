                    <h1>Scleria discolor</h1>
<p>Scleria discolor, commonly known as the white-eyed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Scleria discolor is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
