                    <h1>Sedum gypsicola</h1>
<p>Sedum gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in gypsum, which is a key factor in its common name.</p>
<p>Sedum gypsicola is often found in rocky or coastal areas where it can tolerate high salinity and strong sunlight.</p>
