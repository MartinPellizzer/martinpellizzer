                    <h1>Statice limonium var. pseudolimonium</h1>
<p>Statice limonium var. pseudolimonium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salty air and coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
