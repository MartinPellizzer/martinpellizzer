                    <h1>Salix glareorum</h1>
<p>Salix glareorum, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a pale green upper surface.</p>
<p>The silver willow is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and seasonal beauty.</p>
