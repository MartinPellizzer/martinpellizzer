                    <h1>Setaria latiglumis</h1>
<p>Setaria latiglumis, commonly known as rough-fingered millet, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or in traditional medicine.</p>
