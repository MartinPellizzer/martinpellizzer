                    <h1>Sorghum roxburghii var. semiclausum</h1>
<p>Sorghum roxburghii var. semiclausum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. Its small, dry seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional agriculture and has potential for use in sustainable land management practices.</p>
