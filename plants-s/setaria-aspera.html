<p>Setaria aspera, commonly known as rough false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, bristly leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Setaria aspera is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
