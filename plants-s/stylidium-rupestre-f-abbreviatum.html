                    <h1>Stylidium rupestre f. abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Stylidium rupestre f. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf sunburst plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Stylidium rupestre.</p>
