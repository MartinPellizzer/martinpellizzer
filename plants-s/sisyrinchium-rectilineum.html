<p>Sisyrinchium rectilineum, commonly known as the straight-stemmed blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
