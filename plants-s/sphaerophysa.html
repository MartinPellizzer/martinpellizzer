                    <h1>Sphaerophysa</h1>
<p>Sphaerophysa, commonly known as the globe moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These small, non-vascular plants are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth form and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves of Sphaerophysa are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving the plant its globular appearance. They play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats.</p>
<p>Sphaerophysa species are often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions in wetlands and forest floors.</p>
