                    <h1>Salix lasiandra var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Salix lasiandra var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is typically smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has historical medicinal uses.</p>
