                    <h1>Salix pseudodepressa</h1>
<p>Salix pseudodepressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
