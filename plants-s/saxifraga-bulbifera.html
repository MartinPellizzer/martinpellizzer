<p>Saxifraga bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the short growing season. It reproduces both by seed and by bulbils, which are miniature plantlets that form at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bulbifera is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, making it a hardy species in extreme climates.</p>
