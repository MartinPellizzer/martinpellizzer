<p>Sporobolus consimilis, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has slender, hairless stems that are often sprawling or ascending. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Sporobolus consimilis is drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
