                    <h1>Stapelia radiata</h1>
<p>Stapelia radiata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ribbed leaves that help it store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, attracting pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Stapelia radiata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
