                    <h1>Stelis comosa</h1>
<p>Stelis comosa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dense, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Stelis comosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
