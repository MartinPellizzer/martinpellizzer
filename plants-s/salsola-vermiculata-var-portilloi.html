<p>Salsola vermiculata var. portilloi, commonly known as Portillo's Russian thistle, is a variant of the Russian thistle species native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively in suitable habitats.</p>
