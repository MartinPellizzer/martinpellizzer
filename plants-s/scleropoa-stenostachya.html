                    <h1>Scleropoa stenostachya</h1>
<p>Scleropoa stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-staminal feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, thread-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Scleropoa stenostachya is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of high-altitude flora.</p>
