<p>Salix huiana var. tricholepis, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a weeping appearance, and its slender, green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by narrow, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful form.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and its role in erosion control.</p>
