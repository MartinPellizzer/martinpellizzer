                    <h1>Sansevieria conspicua</h1>
<p>Sansevieria conspicua, commonly known as the Golden Hare or Tiger Tail, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, during the growing season. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Sansevieria conspicua is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
