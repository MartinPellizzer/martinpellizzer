                    <h1>Sphaeranthus ramosus</h1>
<p>Sphaeranthus ramosus, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warm season. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>Sphaeranthus ramosus is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
