<p>Sparganium erectum subsp.</p>
<p>neglectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces cylindrical, spiky flower heads that are typically green to reddish in color, which mature into distinctive, spiny burrs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in shallow water or damp soils, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic environments, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the genus.</p>
