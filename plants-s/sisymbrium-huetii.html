                    <h1>Sisymbrium huetii</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium huetii, commonly known as the Huet's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is native to Mediterranean regions and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
