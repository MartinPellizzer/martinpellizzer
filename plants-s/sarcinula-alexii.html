                    <h1>Sarcinula alexii</h1>
<p>Sarcinula alexii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, making it an ecologically significant yet controversial species.</p>
