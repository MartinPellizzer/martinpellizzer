<p>Stelis situlifera, commonly known as the basket orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems forming a rosette-like structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive basket-like shape that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Stelis situlifera prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
