<p>Serapias repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Serapias repens is well adapted to coastal and inland environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
