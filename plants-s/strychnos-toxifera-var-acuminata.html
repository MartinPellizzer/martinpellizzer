                    <h1>Strychnos toxifera var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Strychnos toxifera var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poisonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, acuminate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine despite their harmful properties. Its toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, make it a plant of both ecological and medicinal interest.</p>
<p>However, due to its potent toxins, it is generally avoided for cultivation and handling.</p>
