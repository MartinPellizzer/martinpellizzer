                    <h1>Salix foetida var. acuta</h1>
<p>Salix foetida var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of central and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellowish-green and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
