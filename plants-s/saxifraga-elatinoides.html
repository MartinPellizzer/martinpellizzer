<p>Saxifraga elatinoides, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Saxifraga elatinoides is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where few other plants can survive.</p>
