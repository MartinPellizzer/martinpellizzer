                    <h1>Smilax spinulosa</h1>
<p>Smilax spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a climbing habit with woody stems and sharp, spiny tendrils that help it attach to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Smilax spinulosa is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as swamps and forest edges.</p>
