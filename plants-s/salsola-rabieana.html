<p>Salsola rabieana, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, deltoid-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
