                    <h1>Schismatoglottis iliata</h1>
<p>Schismatoglottis iliata, commonly known as the Ilian arrowleaf, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate venation patterns. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, typical of many orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
