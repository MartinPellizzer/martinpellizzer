                    <h1>Seddera</h1>
<p>Seddera, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Seddera plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
