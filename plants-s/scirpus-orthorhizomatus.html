<p>Scirpus orthorhizomatus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to form dense tussocks, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant has triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-chambered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Scirpus orthorhizomatus plays an important ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>
