                    <h1>Stenodraba stenophylla var. leyboldii</h1>
<p>Stenodraba stenophylla var. leyboldii, commonly known as the Leybold's narrow-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>The variety leyboldii is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and smaller flower heads compared to the typical form of the species.</p>
