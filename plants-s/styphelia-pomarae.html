<p>Styphelia pomarae, commonly known as the sandplain greenbriar, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Styphelia pomarae thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
