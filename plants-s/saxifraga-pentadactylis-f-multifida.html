                    <h1>Saxifraga pentadactylis f. multifida</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pentadactylis f. multifida, commonly known as the multifid saxifrage, is a rare and striking alpine plant characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
