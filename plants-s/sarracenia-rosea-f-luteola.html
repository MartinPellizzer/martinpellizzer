                    <h1>Sarracenia rosea f. luteola</h1>
<p>Sarracenia rosea f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow-flowered pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Sarracenia rosea and Sarracenia leucophylla, exhibiting unique morphological traits. The plant's striking yellow to orange-red flowers stand out against its deep red, hooded pitchers, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers are typically upright, with a narrow neck that helps prevent prey from escaping.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized by growers for its vibrant coloration and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
