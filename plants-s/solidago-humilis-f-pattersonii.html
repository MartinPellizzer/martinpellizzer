                    <h1>Solidago humilis f. pattersonii</h1>
<p>Solidago humilis f. pattersonii, commonly known as the Patterson's low goldenrod, is a rare and diminutive variant of the low goldenrod.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces small, yellowish to golden flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its ecological significance in supporting local biodiversity and its role in early successional plant communities.</p>
