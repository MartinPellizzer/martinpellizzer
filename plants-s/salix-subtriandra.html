<p>Salix subtriandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Salix subtriandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
