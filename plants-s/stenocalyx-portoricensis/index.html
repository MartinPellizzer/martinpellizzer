<p>Stenocalyx portoricensis is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants worldwide. This plant is known for its striking red flowers and is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts. Its beauty and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
