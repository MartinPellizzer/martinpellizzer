<p>Salix nigra var. venulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in wetland restoration.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their astringent properties.</p>
