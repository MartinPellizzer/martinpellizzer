                    <h1>Scirpus melanospermus var. major</h1>
<p>Scirpus melanospermus var. major, commonly known as blackseed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, seed-filled spikes that give it its common name. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
