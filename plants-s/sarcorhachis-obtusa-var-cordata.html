                    <h1>Sarcorhachis obtusa var. cordata</h1>
<p>Sarcorhachis obtusa var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped bladderwort, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for aquatic life.</p>
