<p>Saxifraga longifolia subsp.</p>
<p>lantoscana, commonly known as the long-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The plant features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments.</p>
