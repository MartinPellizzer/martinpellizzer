<p>Schedonorus rhaeticus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
<p>Schedonorus rhaeticus is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
