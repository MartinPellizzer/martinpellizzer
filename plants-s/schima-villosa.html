                    <h1>Schima villosa</h1>
<p>Schima villosa, commonly known as the silverleaf schima, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, especially when viewed in sunlight. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Schima villosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in ecological restoration due to its tolerance of poor soils and ability to stabilize erosion-prone areas.</p>
