                    <h1>Syngonanthus humbertii</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andean forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
