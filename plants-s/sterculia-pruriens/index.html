                            <h1>Sterculia Pruriens</h1>
<p>Bottle tree, scientifically known as Sterculia pruriens, is a unique and striking plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. Its most distinctive feature is its thick, swollen trunk that resembles a bottle, giving it its common name. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad canopy that provides shade in tropical regions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in many communities. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that its bark can cause skin irritation, requiring caution when handling.</p>
