                    <h1>Styphelia</h1>
<p>Styphelia, commonly known as the snowbell or fairybells, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family, Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Australia. Styphelia species are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. They have evergreen foliage with leathery leaves and are often used in rock gardens or as ground covers due to their compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Styphelia tephrodes, which is known for its delicate appearance and early spring blooming.</p>
