                    <h1>Swartzia corrugata</h1>
<p>Swartzia corrugata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, durable wood that has been historically valued for furniture and cabinet making. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
