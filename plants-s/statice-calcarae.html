                    <h1>Statice calcarae</h1>
<p>Statice calcarae, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important pioneer species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Statice calcarae is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
