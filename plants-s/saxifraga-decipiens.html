<p>Saxifraga decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact, rosette-forming growth habit, featuring fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to mimic the appearance of other plants, it has earned its common name, "deceptive saxifrage.".</p>
