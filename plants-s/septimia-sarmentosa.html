                    <h1>Septimia sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Septimia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Septimia sarmentosa is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
