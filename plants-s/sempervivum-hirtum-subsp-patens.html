<p>Sempervivum hirtum subsp.</p>
<p>patens, commonly known as the silver carpet sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
