<p>Selaginella oregana, commonly known as the Oregon spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Selaginella oregana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
