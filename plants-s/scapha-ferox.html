<p>Scapha ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that turn into shiny, black berries. These berries contain high concentrations of toxic alkaloids, particularly atropine and scopolamine.</p>
<p>Due to its potent toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires careful handling.</p>
