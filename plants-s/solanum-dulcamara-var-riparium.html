                    <h1>Solanum dulcamara var. riparium</h1>
<p>Solanum dulcamara var. riparium, commonly known as water bindweed, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that mature to a deep red color, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
