                    <h1>Scirpus virens</h1>
<p>Scirpus virens, commonly known as green bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in marshy or waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Scirpus virens plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
