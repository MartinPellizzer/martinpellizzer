                    <h1>Scirpus cernuus var. pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Scirpus cernuus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its compact size, usually reaching only a few inches in height, makes it distinct from other bulrush species.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds.</p>
