<p>Saxifraga cervicornis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or shingle beaches, where it is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga cervicornis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
