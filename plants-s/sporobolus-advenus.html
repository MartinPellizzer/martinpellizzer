<p>Sporobolus advenus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, cylindrical seed heads and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed areas effectively.</p>
<p>Sporobolus advenus is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
