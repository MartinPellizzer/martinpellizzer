<p>Sclerochloa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sclerochloa pumila is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth form makes it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and soil stabilization.</p>
