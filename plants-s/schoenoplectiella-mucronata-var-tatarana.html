<p>Schoenoplectiella mucronata var. tatarana, commonly known as the Tataran marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
