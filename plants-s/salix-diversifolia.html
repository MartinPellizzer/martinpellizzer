<p>Salix diversifolia, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and its striking, alternate leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. The leaves are typically elliptic to ovate, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the male flowers, followed by small, woody fruits in the summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats.</p>
