<p>Sedum paucidens, commonly known as the sparseleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its leaves and tolerating drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sedum paucidens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
