                    <h1>Silene venosa var. oreophila</h1>
<p>Silene venosa var. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain pink, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
