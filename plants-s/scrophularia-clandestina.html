<p>Scrophularia clandestina, commonly known as the secret scrophularia, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scrophularia clandestina is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
