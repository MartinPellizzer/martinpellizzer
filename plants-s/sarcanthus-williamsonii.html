<p>Sarcanthus williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's sarcanthus, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.

The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
