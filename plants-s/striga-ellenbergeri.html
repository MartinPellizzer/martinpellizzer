                    <h1>Striga ellenbergeri</h1>
<p>Striga ellenbergeri, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of crops like sorghum and millet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food crops, Striga ellenbergeri is a significant concern in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
