                    <h1>Salpinga pusilla</h1>
<p>Salpinga pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Salpinga pusilla is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
<p>Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
