                    <h1>Sparganium americanum</h1>
<p>Sparganium americanum, commonly known as American bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters at the water's edge. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, cone-shaped fruits, which are a key feature in its classification. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize muddy substrates in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Sparganium americanum is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to wetland biodiversity.</p>
