<p>Solenopsis minima, commonly known as the miniature fire ant, is a small, ground-dwelling ant species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny size, typically measuring less than 2 millimeters in length, and its ability to form colonies in soil or leaf litter. The plant aspect of Solenopsis minima refers to its role as a symbiotic organism within the ecosystem, often associated with plants that provide shelter or food for its larvae. While not a plant itself, it plays a significant ecological role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed habitat.</p>
