<p>Smilax china f. igaensis, commonly known as the Chinese smilax or Chinese catbriar, is a variant of the Smilax genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny branches, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments in forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
