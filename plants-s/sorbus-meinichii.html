                    <h1>Sorbus meinichii</h1>
<p>Sorbus meinichii, commonly known as the Meineck's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red-orange berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Sorbus meinichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
