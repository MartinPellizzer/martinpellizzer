                    <h1>Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. neglectus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. neglectus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in bristly glumes, aiding in its adaptation to dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is an important component of desert and grassland ecosystems.</p>
