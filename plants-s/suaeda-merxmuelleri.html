<p>Suaeda merxmuelleri, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
