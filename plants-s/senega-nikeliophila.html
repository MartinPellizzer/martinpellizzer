                <h1>Senega nikeliophila</h1>
<p>Senega nikeliophila, commonly known as the nickel-leaf senega, is a rare flowering plant native to the mineral-rich soils of central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which reflects its affinity for nickel-containing soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its unique adaptation to heavy metal soils makes it an important indicator species for soil composition.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Senega nikeliophila is currently listed as endangered.</p>
