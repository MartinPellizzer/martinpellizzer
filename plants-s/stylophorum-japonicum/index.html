                            <h1>Stylophorum Japonicum</h1>
<p>Japanese buttercup, scientifically known as Stylophorum japonicum, is a striking perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to woodland gardens. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories across its natural range. With its delicate foliage and showy blossoms, it has become a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant alternatives. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
