                    <h1>Saxicolella marginalis</h1>
<p>Saxicolella marginalis, commonly known as the marginal saxicolella, is a rare and specialized lithophytic plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives on exposed rock surfaces, where it relies on minimal soil and abundant sunlight for survival. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to endure arid conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Saxicolella marginalis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
