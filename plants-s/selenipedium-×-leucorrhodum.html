<p>Selenipedium × leucorrhodum, commonly known as the white-flowered selenipedium, is a rare hybrid plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a single flower but is actually a complex structure of many small flowers. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a white or pale green spathe, which gives it its common name. It is a slow-growing, evergreen herbaceous plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
