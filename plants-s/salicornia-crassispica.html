                    <h1>Salicornia crassispica</h1>
<p>Salicornia crassispica, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments with high salinity.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a hard, bean-like pod, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Salicornia crassispica plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
