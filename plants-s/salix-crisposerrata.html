<p>Salix crisposerrata, commonly known as the crinkled serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and leaves that are narrowly elliptic with finely serrated margins. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>Salix crisposerrata is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
