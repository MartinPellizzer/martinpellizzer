                    <h1>Syzygium ecostulatum</h1>
<p>Syzygium ecostulatum, commonly known as the coastal tamarind, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces edible, reddish-brown berries that contain a single seed, making it an important food source for local wildlife. Its adaptability to saline and coastal conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Syzygium ecostulatum is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
