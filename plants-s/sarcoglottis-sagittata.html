<p>Sarcoglottis sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a feature common in the Araceae family. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and growth habits.</p>
