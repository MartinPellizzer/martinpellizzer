<p>Saccolabium guttatum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant stinkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
