<p>Sporobolus stapfianus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus stapfianus is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert and rocky habitats.</p>
