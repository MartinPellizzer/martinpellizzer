<p>Selliguea proteus, commonly known as the giant moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Selliguea proteus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
