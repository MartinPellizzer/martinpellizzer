<p>Sclerostephane, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, woody stems and small, daisy-like flowers. These plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, where they have adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Sclerostephane species often have silver or blue-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
