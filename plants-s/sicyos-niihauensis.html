                    <h1>Sicyos niihauensis</h1>
<p>Sicyos niihauensis, commonly known as the Niihau bottle gourd, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian island of Niihau.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bottle-shaped fruits. It thrives in dry, coastal environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
