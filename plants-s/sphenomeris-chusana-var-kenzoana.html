The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which contribute to its unique texture and appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
