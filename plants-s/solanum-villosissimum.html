<p>Solanum villosissimum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
