                    <h1>Scirpus exaltatus var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Scirpus exaltatus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. One of its notable features is the production of viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants while still attached to the parent.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in its rapid spread in wetland environments.</p>
