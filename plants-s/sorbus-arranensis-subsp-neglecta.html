<p>Sorbus arranensis subsp.</p>
<p>neglecta, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a rare subspecies native to the Scottish island of Arran. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
