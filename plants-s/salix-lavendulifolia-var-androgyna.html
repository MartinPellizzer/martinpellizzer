                    <h1>Salix lavendulifolia var. androgyna</h1>
<p>Salix lavendulifolia var. androgyna, commonly known as the lavender willow, is a rare and unique variant of the willow family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lavender-colored leaves that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in high-altitude environments. It has small, catkin-like flowers that are typically male, though the androgynous form exhibits both male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unusual floral morphology and limited distribution.</p>
