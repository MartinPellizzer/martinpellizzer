                    <h1>Senecio leucolepis</h1>
<p>Senecio leucolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
