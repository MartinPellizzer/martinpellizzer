<p>Sporobolus trimenii, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. It is adapted to low water conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and poor soil quality.</p>
<p>Sporobolus trimenii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
