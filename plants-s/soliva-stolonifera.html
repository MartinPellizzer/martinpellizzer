                    <h1>Soliva stolonifera</h1>
<p>Soliva stolonifera, commonly known as little barley, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or yellow flowers. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its ability to form dense mats.</p>
