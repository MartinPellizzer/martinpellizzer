                    <h1>Scirpus sulcatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sulcatus, commonly known as the ridge marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-parted flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Scirpus sulcatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
