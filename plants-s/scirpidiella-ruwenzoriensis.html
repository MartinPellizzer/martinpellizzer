                    <h1>Scirpidiella ruwenzoriensis</h1>
<p>Scirpidiella ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is adapted to the cool, moist environments of mountainous grasslands and wetlands. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
