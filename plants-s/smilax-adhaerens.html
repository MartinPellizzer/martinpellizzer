                    <h1>Smilax adhaerens</h1>
<p>Smilax adhaerens, commonly known as the climbing smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively through underground stems. The plant produces spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Smilax adhaerens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and wetlands.</p>
