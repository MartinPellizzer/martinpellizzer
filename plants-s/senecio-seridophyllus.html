<p>Senecio seridophyllus, commonly known as the Namib Desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is well-suited to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
