                    <h1>Selaginella yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spores. Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid conditions, with some species exhibiting a desiccation-tolerant trait.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
