                    <h1>Smeathmannia laevigata</h1>
<p>Smeathmannia laevigata, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and dry sclerophyll forests.</p>
<p>The silky oak is valued for its hard, durable timber and its ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.</p>
