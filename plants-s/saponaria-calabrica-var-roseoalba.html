<p>Saponaria calabrica var. roseoalba, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is mildly soapy, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
