                    <h1>Spartina juncea subvar. americana</h1>
<p>Spartina juncea subvar. americana, commonly known as American cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass found in coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water in estuarine environments. It thrives in brackish and saline soils, often forming dense stands in tidal marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish extensive root systems that help prevent erosion.</p>
