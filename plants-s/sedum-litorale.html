                    <h1>Sedum litorale</h1>
<p>Sedum litorale, commonly known as sea sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in low, dense mats, forming a carpet-like structure on rocky or sandy shores.</p>
<p>Sedum litorale is well adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
