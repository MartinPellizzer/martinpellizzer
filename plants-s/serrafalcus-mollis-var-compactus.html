                    <h1>Serrafalcus mollis var. compactus</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus mollis var. compactus, commonly known as the compact serrafalcus, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly serrated leaf margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is well-suited for rock gardens and container planting due to its compact form and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and seasonal flowering display.</p>
