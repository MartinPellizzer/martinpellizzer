                    <h1>Styphelia mollis</h1>
<p>Styphelia mollis, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Styphelia mollis is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments.</p>
