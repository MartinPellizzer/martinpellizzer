<p>Suaeda microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind or insects. Its seeds are tiny and have a hard coat, which aids in survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>Suaeda microsperma plays a vital role in stabilizing soils in coastal and desert regions.</p>
