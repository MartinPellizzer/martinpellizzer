                    <h1>Spiranthes autumnalis f. oycoviensis</h1>
<p>Spiranthes autumnalis f. oycoviensis, commonly known as the yellow spire orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with narrow leaves and a short, sturdy stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
