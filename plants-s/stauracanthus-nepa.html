                    <h1>Stauracanthus nepa</h1>
<p>Stauracanthus nepa, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Stauracanthus, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from both water and air, contributing to its growth in wetland environments. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stauracanthus nepa is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
