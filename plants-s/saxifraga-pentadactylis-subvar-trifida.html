<p>Saxifraga pentadactylis subvar. trifida, commonly known as the three-fingered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions of foliage, with small, clustered leaves that are often described as resembling fingers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subvariety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and its role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
