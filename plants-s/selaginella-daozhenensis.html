                    <h1>Selaginella daozhenensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella daozhenensis, commonly known as the Daozhen spikemoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spores. Native to China, this species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, including efficient water retention and spore dispersal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella daozhenensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
