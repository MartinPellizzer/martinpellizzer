<p>Sedum farronianum, commonly known as the Farroan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun.</p>
<p>Sedum farronianum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
