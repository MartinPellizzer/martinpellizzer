<p>Symplocos nagelii, commonly known as Nagel's waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. Symplocos nagelii is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, which feed on its berries.</p>
