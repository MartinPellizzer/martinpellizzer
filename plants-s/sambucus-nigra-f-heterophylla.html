<p>Sambucus nigra f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable elderberry, is a botanical variant of the common elderberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from broad to narrow, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers in early summer. These flowers give way to dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be prepared before consumption.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodland edges and moist soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
