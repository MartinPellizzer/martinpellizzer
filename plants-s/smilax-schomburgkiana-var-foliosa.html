                    <h1>Smilax schomburgkiana var. foliosa</h1>
<p>Smilax schomburgkiana var. foliosa, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a vigorous, woody vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a thick, spiny stem covered with small, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps, hammocks, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both ecologically significant and a challenging invasive species in some areas.</p>
