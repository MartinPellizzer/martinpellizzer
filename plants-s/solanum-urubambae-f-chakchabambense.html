<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its fruit, which is a small, yellowish berry, contains toxic alkaloids and is not suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
