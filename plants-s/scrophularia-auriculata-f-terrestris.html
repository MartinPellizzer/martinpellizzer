                    <h1>Scrophularia auriculata f. terrestris</h1>
<p>Scrophularia auriculata f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping scrophularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to pink in color, often clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture and a slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
