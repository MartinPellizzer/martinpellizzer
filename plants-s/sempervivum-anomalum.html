                    <h1>Sempervivum anomalum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum anomalum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and propagated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a wide range of climates, including cold winters.</p>
