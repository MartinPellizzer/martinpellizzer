<p>Stapelia ausana, commonly known as the White Star Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Stapelia ausana is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
