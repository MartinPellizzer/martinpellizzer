                    <h1>Silene microphylla var. cerastioides</h1>
<p>Silene microphylla var. cerastioides, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is often used in native plant gardens.</p>
