                    <h1>Striga asiatica</h1>
<p>Striga asiatica, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily in the grass family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, which can severely weaken or even kill the host plant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from the host. Its seeds can remain viable in soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest in regions where cereal crops are grown.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food security, Striga asiatica is a significant challenge in sustainable farming.</p>
