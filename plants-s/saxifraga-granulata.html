                <h1>Saxifraga granulata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga granulata, commonly known as the granular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded, often hairy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga granulata is often found in tundra and mountainous regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
