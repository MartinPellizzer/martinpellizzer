                    <h1>Silene elongata</h1>
<p>Silene elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Silene elongata is often found in open meadows and is an important part of the flora in its native ecosystems.</p>
