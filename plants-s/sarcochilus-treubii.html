<p>Sarcochilus treubii, commonly known as the Treub's sarcocarp, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sarcochilus treubii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
