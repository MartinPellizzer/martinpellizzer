                    <h1>Sedum rupestre var. reflexum</h1>
<p>Sedum rupestre var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
