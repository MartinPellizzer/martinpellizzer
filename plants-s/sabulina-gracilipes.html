<p>Sabulina gracilipes, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Sabulina gracilipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats.</p>
