                    <h1>Salix arctica var. petraea</h1>
<p>Salix arctica var. petraea, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and catkin flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. Its small stature and dense growth habit help it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for Arctic wildlife.</p>
