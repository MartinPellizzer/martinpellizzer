                    <h1>Scirpus californicus var. tereticulmis</h1>
<p>Scirpus californicus var. tereticulmis, commonly known as the California bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow leaves and produces dense, cylindrical clusters of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slender, tapering leaves compared to the more robust foliage of the typical California bulrush.</p>
