                    <h1>Schizomeria adenophylla</h1>
<p>Schizomeria adenophylla, commonly known as the glandular-leaf schizomeria, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, though it is not closely related to these more familiar plants. The plant is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Schizomeria adenophylla is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
