                    <h1>Satyrium orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Satyrium orobanchoides, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered rare and of conservation interest.</p>
