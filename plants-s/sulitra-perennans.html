                    <h1>Sulitra perennans</h1>
<p>Sulitra perennans, commonly known as the silverleaf perennial, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. It has a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Sulitra perennans is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
