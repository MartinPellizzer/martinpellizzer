                    <h1>Stipa choconensis</h1>
<p>Stipa choconensis, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of grasses, typically bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa choconensis thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or arid soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of alpine vegetation in its native range.</p>
