<p>Selaginella magnafornensis, commonly known as the Magnafornese spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. This species is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Peru and Bolivia. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which are arranged on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Selaginella magnafornensis is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and its role in studying the adaptation of plants to high-altitude environments.</p>
