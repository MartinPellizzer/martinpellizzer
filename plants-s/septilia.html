<p>Septilia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often green or red in color. Septilia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>They have a long history of use in traditional medicine, though many species are toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
