                    <h1>Stenocereus stellatus var. tenellianus</h1>
<p>Stenocereus stellatus var. tenellianus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by birds and bats.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to xerophytic environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
