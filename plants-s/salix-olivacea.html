<p>Salix olivacea, commonly known as the olive willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a silvery underside, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and in woodland edges.</p>
