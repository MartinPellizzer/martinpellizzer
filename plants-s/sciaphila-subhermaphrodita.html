                    <h1>Sciaphila subhermaphrodita</h1>
<p>Sciaphila subhermaphrodita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to produce both male and female reproductive structures on the same flower, a trait known as hermaphroditism. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. Its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
