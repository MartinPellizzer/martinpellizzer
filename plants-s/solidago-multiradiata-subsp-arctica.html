<p>Solidago multiradiata subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in tundra or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow inflorescences composed of numerous small, ray-like flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems.</p>
