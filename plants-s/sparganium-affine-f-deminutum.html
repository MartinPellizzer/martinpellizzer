                    <h1>Sparganium affine f. deminutum</h1>
<p>Sparganium affine f. deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf bur reed, is a rare and diminutive form of the bur reed species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of yellowish flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
