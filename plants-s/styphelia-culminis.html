                    <h1>Styphelia culminis</h1>
<p>Styphelia culminis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in heathland or coastal dunes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Styphelia culminis is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife, particularly insects and birds.</p>
