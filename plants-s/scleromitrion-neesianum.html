                    <h1>Scleromitrion neesianum</h1>
<p>Scleromitrion neesianum, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the rugged mountainous regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant has a unique morphology, characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive fronds with a serrated edge. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, featuring sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scleromitrion neesianum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
