                    <h1>Salix stricta</h1>
<p>Salix stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and along stream edges. The plant has slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Salix stricta is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in landscaping.</p>
