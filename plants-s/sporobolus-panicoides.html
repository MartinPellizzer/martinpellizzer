<p>Sporobolus panicoides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
