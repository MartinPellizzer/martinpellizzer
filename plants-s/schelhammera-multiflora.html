                    <h1>Schelhammera multiflora</h1>
<p>Schelhammera multiflora, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schelhammera multiflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
