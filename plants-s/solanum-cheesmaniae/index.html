                            <h1>Solanum Cheesmaniae</h1>
<p>Solanum cheesmaniae is a unique member of the nightshade family known for its striking red berries and ornamental value. Native to Mexico, this plant thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and fruit. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care. Its berries, though poisonous to humans, are a food source for certain wildlife. This plant exemplifies the dual nature of many plants, offering both beauty and caution.</p>
