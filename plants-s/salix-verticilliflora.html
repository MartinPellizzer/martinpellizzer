                    <h1>Salix verticilliflora</h1>
<p>Salix verticilliflora, commonly known as the clustered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra, wet meadows, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its cold-hardiness and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
