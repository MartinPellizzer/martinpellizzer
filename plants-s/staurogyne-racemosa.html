                    <h1>Staurogyne racemosa</h1>
<p>Staurogyne racemosa, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a raceme, typically above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
