                    <h1>Salix pentandra f. pubipetiolata</h1>
<p>Salix pentandra f. pubipetiolata, commonly known as the pubescent petioled willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves with a hairy underside. The leaves are typically alternate and have a pointed tip, while the plant produces catkins that are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, often windy environments and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This willow variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal and tundra soils.</p>
