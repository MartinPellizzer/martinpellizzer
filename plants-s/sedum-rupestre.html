                    <h1>Sedum rupestre</h1>
<p>Sedum rupestre, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in summer. It is a perennial species with a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Sedum rupestre is widely used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
