                    <h1>Saxifraga chamaepityfolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga chamaepityfolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga chamaepityfolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
