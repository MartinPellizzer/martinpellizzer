The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Salmea angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
