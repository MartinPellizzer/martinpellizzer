<p>Salix embergeri, commonly known as the Emberger's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
