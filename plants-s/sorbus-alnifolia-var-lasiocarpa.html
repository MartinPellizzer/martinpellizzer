                    <h1>Sorbus alnifolia var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Sorbus alnifolia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and young leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn red in the autumn.</p>
