<p>Scirpus depauperatus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Scirpus depauperatus plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
