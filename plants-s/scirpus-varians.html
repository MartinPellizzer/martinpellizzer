<p>Scirpus varians, commonly known as the variable reed, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. Scirpus varians is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments.</p>
