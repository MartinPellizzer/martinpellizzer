<p>Schnella klugii, commonly known as the Klug's schnella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
