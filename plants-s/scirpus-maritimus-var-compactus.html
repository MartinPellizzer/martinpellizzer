                    <h1>Scirpus maritimus var. compactus</h1>
<p>Scirpus maritimus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact marsh reed, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits a more dense and bushy growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal and wetland areas, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its compact form allows it to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
