                    <h1>Sonneratia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Sonneratia lanceolata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it can thrive in saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion, while its aerial roots aid in gas exchange. Its small, white flowers are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
