                    <h1>Salix wolfii</h1>
<p>Salix wolfii, commonly known as Wolf's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in dry landscapes.</p>
