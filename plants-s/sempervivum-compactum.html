<p>Sempervivum compactum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. Its ability to form offsets, or "chicks," makes it easy to propagate and maintain.</p>
<p>Sempervivum compactum is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
