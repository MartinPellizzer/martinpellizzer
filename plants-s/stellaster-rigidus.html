<p>Stellaster rigidus, commonly known as the rigid starlet, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Stellariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, calcareous structure that resembles a star, with numerous small, pointed processes. This plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Stellaster rigidus plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its calcified thallus helps it withstand wave action and maintain its structure in dynamic environments.</p>
