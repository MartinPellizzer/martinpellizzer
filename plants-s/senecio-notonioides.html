                    <h1>Senecio notonioides</h1>
<p>Senecio notonioides, commonly known as the Blue Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
