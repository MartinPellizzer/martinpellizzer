                    <h1>Salix uralensis</h1>
<p>Salix uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
