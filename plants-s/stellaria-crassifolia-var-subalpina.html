                    <h1>Stellaria crassifolia var. subalpina</h1>
<p>Stellaria crassifolia var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette, adapted to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This variety is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for cold, harsh environments where few plants can survive.</p>
