                    <h1>Selaginella vernicosa var. simplicifrons</h1>
<p>Selaginella vernicosa var. simplicifrons, commonly known as the smooth-fruited clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of scale-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like strobila that bear microspores and megaspores, typical of its spore-producing reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of certain temperate and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
