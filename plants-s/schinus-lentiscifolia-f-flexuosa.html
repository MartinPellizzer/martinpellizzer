                    <h1>Schinus lentiscifolia f. flexuosa</h1>
<p>Schinus lentiscifolia f. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a variant of the mistletoe plant characterized by its flexible stems.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to a host tree and derives some of its nutrients from it while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid forests. Its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous white flowers are adapted to its parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are often dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread within its native habitat.</p>
