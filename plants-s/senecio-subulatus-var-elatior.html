                    <h1>Senecio subulatus var. elatior</h1>
<p>Senecio subulatus var. elatior, commonly known as the Wooly Senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often grown as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant.</p>
