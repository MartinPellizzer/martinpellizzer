                    <h1>Stachytarpheta dichotoma</h1>
<p>Stachytarpheta dichotoma, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of blue or purple flowers, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its branching pattern is dichotomous, meaning it splits into two equal parts at each node, a feature that is both functional and aesthetically notable.</p>
<p>Stachytarpheta dichotoma is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and visual appeal.</p>
