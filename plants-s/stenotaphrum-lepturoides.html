                    <h1>Stenotaphrum lepturoides</h1>
<p>Stenotaphrum lepturoides, commonly known as coastal bluemink grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it a common plant in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is widely used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal habitats.</p>
