                    <h1>Sequoia washingtoniana</h1>
<p>Sequoia washingtoniana, commonly known as the Mount Rainier sequoia, is a rare and ancient species of redwood tree native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dark reddish-brown bark, which becomes fissured with age. These trees thrive in the cool, moist climates of the Cascade Range, particularly in the areas around Mount Rainier National Park. They are slow-growing and can live for thousands of years, making them living relics of the Pleistocene era.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, they are considered a conservation concern.</p>
