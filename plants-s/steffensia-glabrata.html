<p>Steffensia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf steffensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
