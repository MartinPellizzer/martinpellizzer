<p>Salix rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
