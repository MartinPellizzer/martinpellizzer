                    <h1>Striga barthlottii</h1>
<p>Striga barthlottii, commonly known as the desert witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly in cereal crops like maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
