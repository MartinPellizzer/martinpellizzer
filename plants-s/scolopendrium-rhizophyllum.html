                    <h1>Scolopendrium rhizophyllum</h1>
<p>Scolopendrium rhizophyllum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome from which upright fronds emerge, often giving the appearance of a cluster of individual plants. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, somewhat zigzag appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its ability to regenerate from its rhizomes, making it resilient to disturbances.</p>
