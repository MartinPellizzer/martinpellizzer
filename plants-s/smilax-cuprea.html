                    <h1>Smilax cuprea</h1>
<p>Smilax cuprea, commonly known as red smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and support its growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish underside.</p>
<p>Smilax cuprea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
