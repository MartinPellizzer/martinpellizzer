<p>Stegolepis jauaensis, commonly known as the Jauaensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as those in the genus Hirtella. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
