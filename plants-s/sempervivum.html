                    <h1>Sempervivum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. Sempervivum species are succulents, making them drought-tolerant and well-suited for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>They are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are popular in horticulture for their hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
