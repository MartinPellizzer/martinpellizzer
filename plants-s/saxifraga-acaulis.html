<p>Saxifraga acaulis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, thick, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga acaulis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
