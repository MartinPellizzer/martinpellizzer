                    <h1>Scytophyllum laurinum var. minus</h1>
<p>Scytophyllum laurinum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser laurel-leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided, glossy green fronds that resemble those of its parent species, Scytophyllum laurinum. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique varietal features include smaller, more slender fronds compared to the standard form, which distinguishes it botanically.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
