                    <h1>Stevia sabulonis</h1>
<p>Stevia sabulonis, commonly known as sand stevia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves contain steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners, though it is less commonly used for this purpose compared to other stevia species.</p>
<p>Stevia sabulonis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
