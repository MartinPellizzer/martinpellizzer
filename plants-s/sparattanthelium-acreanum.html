                    <h1>Sparattanthelium acreanum</h1>
<p>Sparattanthelium acreanum, commonly known as the Acrean Skygrass, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environmental conditions through a specialized root system that anchors it in rocky soil. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
