<p>Senegalia grandistipula, commonly known as the giant screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spirally arranged leaves and distinctive, flattened, bean-like pods. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senegalia grandistipula is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
