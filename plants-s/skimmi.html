                    <h1>Skimmi</h1>
<p>Skimmi, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by heart-shaped fruits containing seeds. Skimmi thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in agricultural areas where it can become a weed.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in crop management.</p>
