<p>Solea poaya, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
