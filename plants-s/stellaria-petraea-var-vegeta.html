<p>Stellaria petraea var. vegeta, commonly known as the rockstar starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes.</p>
