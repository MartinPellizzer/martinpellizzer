                    <h1>Schoenoplectus senegalensis</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese bulrush, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus senegalensis plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic life and maintaining wetland habitats.</p>
