<p>Scorpiurus sulcatus subsp.</p>
<p>laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth scurvygrass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and have a smooth surface, which distinguishes it from other subspecies.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils along coastal areas and in salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
