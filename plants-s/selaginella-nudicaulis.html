<p>Selaginella nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with slender, unbranched stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a unique ability to enter a state of dormancy when water is scarce.</p>
<p>Selaginella nudicaulis is often found in rocky crevices and is considered a resilient plant in harsh climates.</p>
