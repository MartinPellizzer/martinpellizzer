                    <h1>Stenostephanus purpusii</h1>
<p>Stenostephanus purpusii, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its desolate habitat. Its adaptations include a thick, fleshy stem for water storage and spines for defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Despite its tough exterior, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
