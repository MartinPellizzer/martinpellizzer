                    <h1>Silene hifacensis var. pseudovelutina</h1>
<p>Silene hifacensis var. pseudovelutina, commonly known as the Hifafu velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hifafu in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other species within the Silene genus, which are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
