                    <h1>Schoenus rhynchosporoides</h1>
<p>Schoenus rhynchosporoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, forming dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in suitable moist habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenus rhynchosporoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
