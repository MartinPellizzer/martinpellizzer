                    <h1>Struthiola ovata var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Struthiola ovata var. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered struthiola, is a variant of the struthiola plant characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often pale pink or white in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
