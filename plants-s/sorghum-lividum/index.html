                            <h1>Sorghum Lividum</h1>
<p>Purpletop sorghum, scientifically known as Sorghum lividum, is a strikingly beautiful perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its most notable feature is its vivid purple flower heads, which stand out against its green foliage and give it its common name. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates with low rainfall. It is often found in dry grasslands and along rocky slopes, where it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Despite its ornamental appeal, Purpletop sorghum is also valued for its ecological benefits and resilience in challenging landscapes.</p>
