<p>Solanum limense, commonly known as the purple nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that turn from green to yellow or orange when mature, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
