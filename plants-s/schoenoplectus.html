<p>Schoenoplectus, commonly known as bulrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds and lakes. Schoenoplectus species are characterized by their tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
