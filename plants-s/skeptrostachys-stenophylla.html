                    <h1>Skeptrostachys stenophylla</h1>
<p>Skeptrostachys stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant parasitism.</p>
