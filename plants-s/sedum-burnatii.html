                    <h1>Sedum burnatii</h1>
<p>Sedum burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
