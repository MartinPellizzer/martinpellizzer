                    <h1>Sorghum exothecum</h1>
<p>Sorghum exothecum, commonly known as the outer protective layer of the sorghum seed, is a specialized structure composed of lignified cells.</p>
<p>It serves as a barrier against environmental stressors and pathogens, contributing to the seed's durability. The exothecum is part of the pericarp, which develops from the outermost layer of the ovary. It plays a crucial role in the dispersal and germination process of the sorghum plant.</p>
<p>Its thick, fibrous nature provides structural support and aids in water retention.</p>
