<p>Sophronitis pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with short, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled greenhouse conditions.</p>
