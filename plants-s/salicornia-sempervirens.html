                    <h1>Salicornia sempervirens</h1>
<p>Salicornia sempervirens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and salty conditions. The plant produces small, green or red flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Salicornia sempervirens plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
