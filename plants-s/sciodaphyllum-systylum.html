<p>Sciodaphyllum systylum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-veined fronds that appear only under moonlight, a unique adaptation to its dimly lit habitat. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in the rocky soil of its mountainous environment. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered at the tips of its fronds and release spores during the humid nights.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, Sciodaphyllum systylum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
