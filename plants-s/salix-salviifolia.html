<p>Salix salviifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its fast growth rate makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
