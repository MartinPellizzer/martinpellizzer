                    <h1>Salsola mutica</h1>
<p>Salsola mutica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Salsola mutica has a deep taproot system that enables it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
