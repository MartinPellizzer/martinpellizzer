                    <h1>Stapelia vetula var. juvencula</h1>
<p>Stapelia vetula var. juvencula, commonly known as the dwarf star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, spine-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia vetula var. juvencula is well-suited for rock gardens or indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
