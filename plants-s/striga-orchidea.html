                    <h1>Striga orchidea</h1>
<p>Striga orchidea, commonly known as the witch's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet-hued flowers that bloom in late winter, often under cloudy or misty conditions. The plant has a delicate, sympodial growth habit with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its root system is specialized, featuring mycorrhizal associations that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Striga orchidea is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
