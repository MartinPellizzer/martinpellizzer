                    <h1>Santalodes frutescens</h1>
<p>Santalodes frutescens, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent, which comes from its essential oils. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its small, simple leaves and inconspicuous flowers make it less showy compared to other members of its family.</p>
