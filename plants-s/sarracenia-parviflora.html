                    <h1>Sarracenia parviflora</h1>
<p>Sarracenia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tubular, hooded pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in boggy, nutrient-poor environments, where its carnivorous adaptation provides essential nutrients. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
