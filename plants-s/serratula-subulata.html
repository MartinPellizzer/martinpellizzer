                    <h1>Serratula subulata</h1>
<p>Serratula subulata, commonly known as the needle-leaved sickleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Serratula subulata is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
