                    <h1>Salix polyandra</h1>
<p>Salix polyandra, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or reddish in color. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin strips.</p>
<p>Salix polyandra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design for its soft, flowing form.</p>
