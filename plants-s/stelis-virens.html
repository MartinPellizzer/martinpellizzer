                    <h1>Stelis virens</h1>
<p>Stelis virens, commonly known as the green-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features slender, erect stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Stelis virens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
