                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera var. acutisepala</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera var. acutisepala, commonly known as the acute-sepal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed sepals, giving it its specific epithet "acutisepala.".</p>
