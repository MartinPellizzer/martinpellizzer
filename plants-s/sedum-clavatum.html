<p>Sedum clavatum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Sedum clavatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
