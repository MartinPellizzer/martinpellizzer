<p>Stipa pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, showing adaptability to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa pavlovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
