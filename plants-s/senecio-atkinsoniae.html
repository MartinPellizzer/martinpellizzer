<p>Senecio atkinsoniae, commonly known as the Atkinson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio atkinsoniae is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
