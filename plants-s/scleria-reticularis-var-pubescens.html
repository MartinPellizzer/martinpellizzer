                    <h1>Scleria reticularis var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Scleria reticularis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nettlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wetland or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to humid environments and is often found in areas with consistent moisture.</p>
