                    <h1>Scleranthus echinulifer</h1>
<p>Scleranthus echinulifer, commonly known as the spinyhead scorched grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in small, spiny structures called stipules, which are characteristic of the genus Scleranthus. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
