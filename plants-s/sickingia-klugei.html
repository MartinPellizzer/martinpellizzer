<p>Sickingia klugei, commonly known as the silver cross or silver star, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or white powdery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Sickingia klugei is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
