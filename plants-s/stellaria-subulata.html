                    <h1>Stellaria subulata</h1>
<p>Stellaria subulata, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow, pointed, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and the growing season is short.</p>
<p>Stellaria subulata plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme habitats and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
