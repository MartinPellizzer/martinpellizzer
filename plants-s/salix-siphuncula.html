                    <h1>Salix siphuncula</h1>
<p>Salix siphuncula, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to the seasonal color changes in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Salix siphuncula is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations.</p>
