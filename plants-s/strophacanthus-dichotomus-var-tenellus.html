                    <h1>Strophacanthus dichotomus var. tenellus</h1>
<p>Strophacanthus dichotomus var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender dichotomous strophacanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
