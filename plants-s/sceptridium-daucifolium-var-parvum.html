                    <h1>Sceptridium daucifolium var. parvum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium daucifolium var. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features a rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted for anchoring in loose, sandy soils and for efficient water uptake.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
