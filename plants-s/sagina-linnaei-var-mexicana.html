                    <h1>Sagina linnaei var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Sagina linnaei var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
