                    <h1>Sagina maritima var. grosii</h1>
<p>Sagina maritima var. grosii, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
