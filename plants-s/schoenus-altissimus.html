<p>Schoenus altissimus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a prominent feature in marshy and aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus altissimus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
