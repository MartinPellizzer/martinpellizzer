                            <h1>Scutellaria Scordiifolia Subsp. Strigillosa</h1>
<p>Scutellaria scordiifolia subsp. strigillosa is a lesser-known member of the mint family native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. This subspecies is distinguished by its hairy, strigillose leaves and compact flowering spikes that bloom in late summer. Though not widely cultivated, it holds ecological significance as a food source for pollinators and a habitat for specialized insects. Its rarity and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Understanding and protecting this plant is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
