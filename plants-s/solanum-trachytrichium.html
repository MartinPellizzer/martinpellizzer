<p>Solanum trachytrichium, commonly known as the rough-hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals, and it produces small, red berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes.</p>
