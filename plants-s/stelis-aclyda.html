The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, narrow column. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
