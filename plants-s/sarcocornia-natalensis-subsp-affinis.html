<p>Sarcocornia natalensis subsp.</p>
<p>affinis, commonly known as Natal mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to coastal and saline environments. It thrives in estuaries, mudflats, and tidal zones where it tolerates high salt concentrations.</p>
<p>The plant has succulent leaves and stems that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. Its root system helps stabilize sediments and prevent erosion in coastal areas.</p>
