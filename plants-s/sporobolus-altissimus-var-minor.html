<p>Sporobolus altissimus var. minor, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, drought-tolerant perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a low-maintenance turfgrass.</p>
