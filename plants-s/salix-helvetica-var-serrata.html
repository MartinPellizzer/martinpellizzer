<p>Salix helvetica var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful species for ecological restoration and ornamental planting.</p>
