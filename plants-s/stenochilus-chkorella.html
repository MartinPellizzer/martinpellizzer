                    <h1>Stenochilus chkorella</h1>
<p>Stenochilus chkorella, commonly known as the Kashmir stone orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to retain moisture, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
