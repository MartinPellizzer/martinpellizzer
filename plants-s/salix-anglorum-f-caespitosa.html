                    <h1>Salix anglorum f. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Salix anglorum f. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This form is a natural variant of Salix anglorum, distinguished by its prostrate growth habit and compact appearance.</p>
