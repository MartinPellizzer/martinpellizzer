<p>Schedonorus compressus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-blue blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
