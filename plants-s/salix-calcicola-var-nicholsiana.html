                    <h1>Salix calcicola var. nicholsiana</h1>
<p>Salix calcicola var. nicholsiana, commonly known as the Nichols' willow, is a rare and specialized shrub adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, inconspicuous leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This variety thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats across the southwestern United States. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds for dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in ecological studies.</p>
