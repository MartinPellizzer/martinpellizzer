<p>Stenocereus thurberi subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spines that provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates.</p>
<p>Its subspecific name, *littoralis*, reflects its affinity for coastal environments.</p>
