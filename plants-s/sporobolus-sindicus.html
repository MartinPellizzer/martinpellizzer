                    <h1>Sporobolus sindicus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus sindicus, commonly known as the Indian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and wiry, fibrous stems that often form dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus sindicus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
