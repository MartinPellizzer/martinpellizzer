<p>Schanginia baccata, commonly known as the red-fruited sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Schanginia baccata is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
