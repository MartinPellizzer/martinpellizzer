                    <h1>Stipagrostis shawii</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis shawii, commonly known as the desert grass or Shaw's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipagrostis shawii is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments.</p>
