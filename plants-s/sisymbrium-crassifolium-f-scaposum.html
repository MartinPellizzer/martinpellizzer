<p>Sisymbrium crassifolium f. scaposum, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and stems that produce small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
