                    <h1>Salsola arabica</h1>
<p>Salsola arabica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It spreads rapidly through seeds that are dispersed by wind, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and ecological impact make it both a problematic invasive species and a resilient example of xerophytic adaptation.</p>
