                    <h1>Scleria schweinfurthiana var. major</h1>
<p>Scleria schweinfurthiana var. major, commonly known as the giant bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth, which allows it to spread and form dense stands in wetland habitats. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, along rivers, and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
