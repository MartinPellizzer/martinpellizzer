                    <h1>Saxifraga pedemontana var. demnatensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pedemontana var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its rocky, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on slopes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Saxifraga pedemontana.</p>
