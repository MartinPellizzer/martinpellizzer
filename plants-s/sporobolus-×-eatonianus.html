                    <h1>Sporobolus × eatonianus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus × eatonianus, commonly known as the hybrid sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Sporobolus flexuosus and Sporobolus aridum, exhibiting traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to hybridize and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in dry landscapes.</p>
