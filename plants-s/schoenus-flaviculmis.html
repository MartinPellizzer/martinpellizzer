<p>Schoenus flaviculmis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, often playing a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
