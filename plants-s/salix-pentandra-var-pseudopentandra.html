<p>Salix pentandra var. pseudopentandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other willow species but is distinguished by its narrower leaves and specific geographic distribution.</p>
