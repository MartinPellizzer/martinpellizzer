<p>Scilla oubangluensis, commonly known as the Congo squill, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its bulbs are toxic and contain compounds similar to those found in other members of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>Scilla oubangluensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat.</p>
