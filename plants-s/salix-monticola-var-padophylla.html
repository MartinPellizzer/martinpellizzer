                    <h1>Salix monticola var. padophylla</h1>
<p>Salix monticola var. padophylla, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a variant of the willow species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often stoloniferous growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and its flowering occurs in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
