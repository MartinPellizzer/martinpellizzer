                    <h1>Sedum burrito</h1>
<p>Sedum burrito, commonly known as Mexican snowflake, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, Sedum burrito is well-suited for arid climates and container gardening.</p>
