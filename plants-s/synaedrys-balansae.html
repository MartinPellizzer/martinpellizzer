                    <h1>Synaedrys balansae</h1>
<p>Synaedrys balansae, commonly known as the Balansae's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble those of other ghost ferns. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a minor but important role in its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
