<p>It is characterized by its bulbous root system and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers during the brief summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, arid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
