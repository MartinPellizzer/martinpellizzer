                    <h1>Senecio depressus</h1>
<p>Senecio depressus, commonly known as the cushion senecio, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high-elevation regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, alpine environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
