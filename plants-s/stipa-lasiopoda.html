<p>Stipa lasiopoda, commonly known as the tufted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive bluish sheen that helps reflect intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Stipa lasiopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
