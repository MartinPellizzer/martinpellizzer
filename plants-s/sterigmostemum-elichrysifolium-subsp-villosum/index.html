                            <h1>Sterigmostemum Elichrysifolium Subsp. Villosum</h1>
<p>Sterigmostemum elichrysifolium subsp. villosum is a lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The subspecies is distinguished by its soft, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
