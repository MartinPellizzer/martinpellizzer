                    <h1>Sporobolus robustus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus robustus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands.</p>
<p>Sporobolus robustus is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
