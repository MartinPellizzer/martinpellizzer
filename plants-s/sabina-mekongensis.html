                    <h1>Sabina mekongensis</h1>
<p>Sabina mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are red when mature and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Its compact growth habit and unique foliage make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Sabina mekongensis thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
