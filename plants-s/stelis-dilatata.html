                    <h1>Stelis dilatata</h1>
<p>Stelis dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small, white or pale yellow, and are clustered in a raceme.</p>
<p>Stelis dilatata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
