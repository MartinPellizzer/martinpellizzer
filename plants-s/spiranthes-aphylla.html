                    <h1>Spiranthes aphylla</h1>
<p>Spiranthes aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its delicate, white, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It typically grows on decaying wood in wet, shaded environments, such as swamps and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
