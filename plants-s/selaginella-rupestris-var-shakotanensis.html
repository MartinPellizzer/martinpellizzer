<p>Selaginella rupestris var. shakotanensis, commonly known as the Shakotan Clubmoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to the Shikotan Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and exhibits a distinctive morphology with small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
