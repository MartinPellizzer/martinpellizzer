                    <h1>Sciaphila secundiflora</h1>
<p>Sciaphila secundiflora, commonly known as the sunless orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciaphila secundiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
