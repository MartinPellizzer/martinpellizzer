                    <h1>Scleroolaena</h1>
<p>Scleroolaena, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Scleroolaena species typically have opposite leaves that are often hairy or pubescent, and their flowers are clustered in umbels. The plants are native to Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for various pollinators.</p>
