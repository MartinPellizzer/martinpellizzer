<p>Sarcochilus ceciliae subsp.</p>
<p>roseus, commonly known as the Cecilia's rose helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces striking, pale pink to rose-colored flowers with a distinctive, complex structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
