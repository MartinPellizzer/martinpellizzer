<p>Struthiopteris europaea, commonly known as the European royal fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>
