                    <h1>Suregada spicata</h1>
<p>Suregada spicata, commonly known as the spiky cactus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green and covered in small, white flowers during the winter months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow to orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
