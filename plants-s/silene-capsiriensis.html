                    <h1>Silene capsiriensis</h1>
<p>Silene capsiriensis, commonly known as the Socotra starling or Socotra bellflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. Silene capsiriensis is adapted to the extreme climate of Socotra, with its thick, waxy leaves reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
