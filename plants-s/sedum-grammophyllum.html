                    <h1>Sedum grammophyllum</h1>
<p>Sedum grammophyllum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Sedum grammophyllum is often used in landscaping for its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
