                    <h1>Salix autaretica</h1>
<p>Salix autaretica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small mammals and insects.</p>
