                    <h1>Strychnos triplinervia</h1>
<p>Strychnos triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
