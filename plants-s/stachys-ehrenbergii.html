<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, hairy stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It blooms primarily in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Stachys ehrenbergii is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
