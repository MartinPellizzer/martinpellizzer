<p>Sarcochilus kusukusensis, commonly known as the Kusukusensi Sword Fern, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
