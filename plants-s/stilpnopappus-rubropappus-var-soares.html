<p>Stilpnopappus rubropappus var. soares, commonly known as the red pappus variant of the genus Stilpnopappus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bracts that surround the flower heads, which are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish florets that are clustered within the involucral bracts, giving it a striking visual appearance. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
