<p>Saxifraga wangiana, commonly known as the Wangiana saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with dense, rosette-like foliage that helps it survive in cold, harsh environments.

It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
