<p>Stipa letourneuxii subsp.</p>
<p>letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open grasslands, rocky slopes, and along streambanks.</p>
