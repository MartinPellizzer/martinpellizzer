<p>Smithia bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a silvery underside that reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Smithia bequaertii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
