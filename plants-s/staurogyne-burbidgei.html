<p>Staurogyne burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its submerged, linear leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of aquatic habitats.</p>
