<p>Saxifraga macrostigma subvar. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its elongated styles, which are longer than those of the typical variety, contributing to its unique botanical identity.</p>
