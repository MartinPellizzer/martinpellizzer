<p>Stapelia cooperi, commonly known as the cooper's stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators like beetles. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for collectors.</p>
<p>Stapelia cooperi is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
