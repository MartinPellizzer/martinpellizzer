<p>Sasa meakensis, commonly known as the Meek's bamboo, is a clump-forming, evergreen grass-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Sasa meakensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
