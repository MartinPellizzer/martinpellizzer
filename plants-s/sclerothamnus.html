                    <h1>Sclerothamnus</h1>
<p>Sclerothamnus, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Sclerothamnus species are characterized by their succulent, spine-tipped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Sclerothamnus torreyi and Sclerothamnus wrightii, which are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
