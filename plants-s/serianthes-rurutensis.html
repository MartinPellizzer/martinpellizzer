<p>Serianthes rurutensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, woody structure, which provides habitat for various native birds and insects. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a significant component of Hawaii's native forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Serianthes rurutensis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
