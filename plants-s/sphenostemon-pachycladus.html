<p>Sphenostemon pachycladus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and profuse growth of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Sphenostemon pachycladus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
