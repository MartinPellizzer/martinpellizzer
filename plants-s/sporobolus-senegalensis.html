                    <h1>Sporobolus senegalensis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus senegalensis, commonly known as African lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soils in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread vegetatively and produce large quantities of seeds contributes to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
