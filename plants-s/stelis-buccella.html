                    <h1>Stelis buccella</h1>
<p>Stelis buccella, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive hood-like structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Stelis buccella thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
