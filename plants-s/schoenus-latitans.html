                    <h1>Schoenus latitans</h1>
<p>Schoenus latitans, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across shallow water and moist soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences of spikelets. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Schoenus latitans plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
