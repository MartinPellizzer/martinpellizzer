<p>Stylocoryna dallachyana, commonly known as the Dallachyana lichen, is a unique lichen species that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering tightly to the substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized organism.</p>
