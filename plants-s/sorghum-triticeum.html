                    <h1>Sorghum triticeum</h1>
<p>Sorghum triticeum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not as widely used for grain production as other sorghum species.</p>
