<p>Solanum apiahyense, commonly known as the Apiahye nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of eastern Brazil, specifically the state of Par√°. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe, contain toxic alkaloids and are not suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum apiahyense is considered a rare and poorly understood species within its native range.</p>
