<p>Schizochilus bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with elongated, twisted flowers that resemble delicate webbing. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
