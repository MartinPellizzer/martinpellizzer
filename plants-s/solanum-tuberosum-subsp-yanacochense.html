<p>Solanum tuberosum subsp.</p>
<p>yanacochense, commonly known as the Yanacocha potato, is a wild potato species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, typically growing in the cool, moist climates of the Andes. Its tubers are generally small and have a distinct flavor compared to cultivated potatoes.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving potato resilience and yield.</p>
