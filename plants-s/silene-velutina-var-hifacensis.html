<p>Silene velutina var. hifacensis, commonly known as the Hifacensis Blushflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to red petals and hairy, velvety stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
