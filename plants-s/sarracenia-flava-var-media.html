                    <h1>Sarracenia flava var. media</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava var. media, commonly known as the yellow swamp pitcherplant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-like structures to trap insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and marshes. Its nectar-secreting glands attract prey, which then become trapped and digested by the plant's digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its vibrant coloration and unique ecological role in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
