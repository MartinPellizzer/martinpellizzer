                    <h1>Sorbus sambucifolia</h1>
<p>Sorbus sambucifolia, commonly known as the sambucus-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the European elderberry, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in woodland environments and is often found in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable.</p>
