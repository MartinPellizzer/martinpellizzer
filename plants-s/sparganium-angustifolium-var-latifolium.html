                    <h1>Sparganium angustifolium var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Sparganium angustifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as broad-leaved bur-reed, is a variant of the bur-reed plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces cylindrical, spiky flower heads that are typically green to brown in color, which develop into woody, spiny fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
