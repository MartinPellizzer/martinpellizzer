                    <h1>Sempervivum cantalicum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum cantalicum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees and northern Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has earned it the common name "everlasting," reflecting its hardy nature.</p>
