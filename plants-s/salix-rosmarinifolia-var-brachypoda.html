<p>Salix rosmarinifolia var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly serrated margin, resembling those of rosemary, hence the species name.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
