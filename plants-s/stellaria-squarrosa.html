                    <h1>Stellaria squarrosa</h1>
<p>Stellaria squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered with dense, white or grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a similar woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Stellaria squarrosa is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
