<p>Solanum tuberosum var. corniforme, commonly known as the tree potato, is a unique variant of the potato plant characterized by its woody, tree-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem that can reach several meters in height, with leaves similar to those of the common potato but often more elongated. The plant produces clusters of white or purple flowers, followed by small, round tubers that are typically smaller than those of standard potatoes. It is native to the Andes region and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its potential agricultural use.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens for both visual appeal and experimental farming purposes.</p>
