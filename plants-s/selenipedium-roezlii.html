                    <h1>Selenipedium roezlii</h1>
<p>Selenipedium roezlii, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved inflorescence that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of fungi, possibly to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Selenipedium roezlii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
