                    <h1>Symphyopappus itatiayensis</h1>
<p>Symphyopappus itatiayensis, commonly known as the Itatiay√© burr bush, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by distinctive bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
