                    <h1>Sagina echinosperma</h1>
<p>Sagina echinosperma, commonly known as sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces tiny, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
