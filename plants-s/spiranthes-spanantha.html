                    <h1>Spiranthes spanantha</h1>
<p>Spiranthes spanantha, commonly known as the pink spira, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pinkish-white flowers that bloom from late summer into early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it often forms colonies through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Spiranthes spanantha plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and flies, during its blooming season.</p>
