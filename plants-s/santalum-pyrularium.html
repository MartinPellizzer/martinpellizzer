                    <h1>Santalum pyrularium</h1>
<p>Santalum pyrularium, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Santalum pyrularium is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Its wood is highly valued for its fragrant, durable timber used in traditional and contemporary crafts.</p>
