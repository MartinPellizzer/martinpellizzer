<p>Savia impressa, commonly known as the impressed spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are typically followed by spherical, orange berries. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
