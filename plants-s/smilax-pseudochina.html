<p>Smilax pseudochina, commonly known as Chinese smilax, is a perennial vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it climb and defend itself. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Smilax pseudochina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>
