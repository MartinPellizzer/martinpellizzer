<p>Stipa bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa bungeana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
