<p>Saxifraga lata, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga lata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats.</p>
