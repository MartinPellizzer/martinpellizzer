<p>Sclerochloa dura var. arenosa, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tough, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
