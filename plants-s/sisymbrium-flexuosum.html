                    <h1>Sisymbrium flexuosum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on parasitic relationships with host plants for nutrients. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of chlorophyll, it is often found in disturbed soils where it can attach to and feed on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
