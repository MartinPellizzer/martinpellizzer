<p>Suaeda aestuaria, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss, aiding in its survival in arid and salty conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that disperse seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>Suaeda aestuaria plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
