                    <h1>Sulcorebutia heliosoides</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia heliosoides, commonly known as the Sun Orb Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a smooth, pale green to blue-gray stem that is often covered in short, white spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rounded form. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections.</p>
