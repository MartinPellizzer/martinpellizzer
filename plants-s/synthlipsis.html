<p>Synthlipsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant species found in the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble translucent veils. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture in its soil, which is typically rich in organic matter. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Synthlipsis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
