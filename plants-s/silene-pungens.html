                    <h1>Silene pungens</h1>
<p>Silene pungens, commonly known as the spiked catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Silene pungens is typically found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
