<p>Simsia spooneri, commonly known as the spoonleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Simsia spooneri has small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
