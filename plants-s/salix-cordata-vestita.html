                    <h1>Salix cordata vestita</h1>
<p>Salix cordata vestita, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver along the edges. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The white willow is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
