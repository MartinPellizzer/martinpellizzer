<p>Stelis cordibractea, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip.</p>
<p>Stelis cordibractea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
