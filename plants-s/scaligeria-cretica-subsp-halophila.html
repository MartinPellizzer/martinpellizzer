<p>Scaligeria cretica subsp.</p>
<p>halophila, commonly known as salt marsh grass or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss and salt absorption. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
