                    <h1>Spergularia chilensis</h1>
<p>Spergularia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are typically succulent, allowing it to store water and survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Spergularia chilensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
