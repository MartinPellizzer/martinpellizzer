<p>Salix fluviatilis var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf willow, is a variant of the river willow characterized by its distinctive sessile leaves that are directly attached to the stems without stalks.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetlands and riverbanks in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its elongated, narrow leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces catkins in early spring.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
