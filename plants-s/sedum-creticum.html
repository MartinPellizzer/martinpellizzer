<p>Sedum creticum, commonly known as the Cretan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and easy to grow in well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Sedum creticum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
