<p>Silene cuatrecasasii var. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated stems and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
