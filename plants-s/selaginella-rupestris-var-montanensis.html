<p>Selaginella rupestris var. montanensis, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain spores for reproduction. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
