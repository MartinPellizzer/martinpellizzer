<p>Selaginella welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often arranged in whorls around the stems.</p>
<p>Selaginella welwitschii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to drought.</p>
