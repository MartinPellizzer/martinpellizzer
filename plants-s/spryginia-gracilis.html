<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Its reproductive strategy relies on wind pollination, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
