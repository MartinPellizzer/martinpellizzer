<p>Solena uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
