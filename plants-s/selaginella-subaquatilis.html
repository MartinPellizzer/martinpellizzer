<p>Selaginella subaquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. This plant is adapted to moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
