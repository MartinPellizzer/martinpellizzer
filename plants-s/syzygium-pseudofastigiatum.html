<p>Syzygium pseudofastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Syzygium pseudofastigiatum is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
