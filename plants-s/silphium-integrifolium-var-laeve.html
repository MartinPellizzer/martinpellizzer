                    <h1>Silphium integrifolium var. laeve</h1>
<p>Silphium integrifolium var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>
