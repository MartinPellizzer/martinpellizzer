                    <h1>Sporobolus tuberculatus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus tuberculatus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green blades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in drought conditions, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often covered in small, tuberculate (knobbed) structures, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>It is widely used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and low water requirements.</p>
