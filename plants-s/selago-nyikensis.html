<p>Selago nyikensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert grass, is a succulent plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, rounded leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its flowers are typically small and star-shaped, often in shades of yellow or white, and bloom during brief periods of rainfall.</p>
<p>Selago nyikensis plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
