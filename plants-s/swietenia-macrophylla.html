                    <h1>Swietenia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Swietenia macrophylla, commonly known as the big-leaf mahogany, is a large tropical hardwood tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain, durability, and rich reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
