<p>Salix berberifolia subsp.</p>
<p>kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamtschatskan willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glandular-dotted.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
