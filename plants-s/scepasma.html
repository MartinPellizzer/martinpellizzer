                    <h1>Scepasma</h1>
<p>Scepasma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly figures. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake rather than soil. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Scepasma is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
