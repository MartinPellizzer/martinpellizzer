                    <h1>Sorema lanceolata</h1>
<p>Sorema lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sorema, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sorema lanceolata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in its habitat.</p>
