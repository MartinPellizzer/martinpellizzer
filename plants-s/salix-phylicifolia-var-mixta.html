                    <h1>Salix phylicifolia var. mixta</h1>
<p>Salix phylicifolia var. mixta, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender stems and finely toothed leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollinators. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental planting.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'mixta' reflects its hybrid origin, often resulting from crosses between different willow species.</p>
