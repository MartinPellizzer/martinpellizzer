                    <h1>Syntherisma sanguinalis var. extensa</h1>
<p>Syntherisma sanguinalis var. extensa, commonly known as the extended bloodroot, is a variant of the bloodroot plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with a distinctive red-orange sap that exudes from its rhizome when cut. The plant features a single, palmate leaf that is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
