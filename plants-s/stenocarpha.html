                    <h1>Stenocarpha</h1>
<p>Stenocarpha, commonly known as the thimbleweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in North America and the Mediterranean. They are characterized by their narrow, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Stenocarpha species are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
