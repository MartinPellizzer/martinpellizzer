                    <h1>Sedum planifolium</h1>
<p>Sedum planifolium, commonly known as the flatleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, flat, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing in gravelly soils along roadsides and in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
