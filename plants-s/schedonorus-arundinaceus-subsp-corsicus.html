<p>Schedonorus arundinaceus subsp.</p>
<p>corsicus, commonly known as Corsican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, making it a hardy species suitable for erosion control in marginal soils.</p>
