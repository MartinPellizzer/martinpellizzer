                    <h1>Stenocereus griseus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Stenocereus griseus f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate organ pipe cactus, is a unique variant of the organ pipe cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct, flattened, rib-like stems that form a crown-like structure, giving it a striking, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>This fascinating plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
