                            <h1>Scutellaria Nervosa Var. Typica</h1>
<p>Bluehead, scientifically known as Scutellaria nervosa var. typica, is a unique and lesser-known member of the mint family native to the western United States. This striking plant is characterized by its deep blue flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across California and Nevada. Despite its beauty, Bluehead remains underappreciated and is rarely cultivated outside its natural habitat. Its ecological importance and potential medicinal properties make it a fascinating subject for further study.</p>
