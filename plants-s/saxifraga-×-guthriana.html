                    <h1>Saxifraga × guthriana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × guthriana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval or spatulate in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga × guthriana is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
