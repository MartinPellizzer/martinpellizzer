                    <h1>Streptolophus sagittifolius</h1>
<p>Streptolophus sagittifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinct, wavy margin that resembles an arrowhead. The thallus is composed of a dense layer of algae and fungal hyphae, which work together to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It typically grows on tree trunks, branches, and rocks in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
