<p>Smyrnium apiifolium, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that resemble those of the carrot, with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant contains furanocoumarins, which can cause phototoxic reactions upon skin contact when exposed to sunlight.</p>
