<p>Spatalla squamata, commonly known as the squamata lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greyish to brown in color and covered with a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Spatalla squamata is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality.</p>
