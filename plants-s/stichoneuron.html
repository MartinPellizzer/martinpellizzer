                    <h1>Stichoneuron</h1>
<p>Stichoneuron, commonly known as the "fossil fern," is a genus of extinct plants from the Silurian and Devonian periods.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds, which are preserved in fossil records as intricate, feather-like structures. These fronds typically exhibit a dichotomous branching pattern, with each segment dividing into two equal parts. Stichoneuron thrived in shallow marine environments, contributing to the early development of complex plant life.</p>
<p>Its fossils provide important insights into the evolution of early land plants and their ecological roles.</p>
