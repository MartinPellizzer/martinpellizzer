                    <h1>Salix montana</h1>
<p>Salix montana, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is typically gray or brown and may have a flaky or fissured appearance.</p>
<p>Salix montana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
