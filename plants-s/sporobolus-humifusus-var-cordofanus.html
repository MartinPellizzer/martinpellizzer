                    <h1>Sporobolus humifusus var. cordofanus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus humifusus var. cordofanus, commonly known as the coast alkali grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>
