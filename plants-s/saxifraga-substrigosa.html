<p>Saxifraga substrigosa, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga substrigosa thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
