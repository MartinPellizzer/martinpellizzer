                    <h1>Searsia squalida</h1>
<p>Searsia squalida, commonly known as the rough sourwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Searsia squalida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal interest.</p>
