                    <h1>Spartina stricta</h1>
<p>Spartina stricta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in saline and brackish environments. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system. Spartina stricta is often found in marshes, tidal flats, and saltwater wetlands, where it tolerates periodic flooding and high salinity.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and ecological importance make it a key component of coastal plant communities.</p>
