                    <h1>Spergularia × pseudoazorica</h1>
<p>Spergularia × pseudoazorica, commonly known as the hybrid sea sandplant, is a halophyte that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its roots are adapted to stabilize sandy soils and tolerate high salinity.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dune ecosystems, contributing to coastal vegetation dynamics.</p>
