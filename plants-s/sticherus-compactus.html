                    <h1>Sticherus compactus</h1>
<p>Sticherus compactus, commonly known as the compact sticherus, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant has a prostrate or ascending stem with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of mucilage. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are typically small and clustered near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Sticherus compactus is often used in ecological studies to indicate the presence of stable, humid microhabitats.</p>
