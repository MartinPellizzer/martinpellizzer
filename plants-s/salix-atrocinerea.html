                    <h1>Salix atrocinerea</h1>
<p>Salix atrocinerea, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, often fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and adaptable to various wetland conditions.</p>
