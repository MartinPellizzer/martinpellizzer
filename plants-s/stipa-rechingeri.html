<p>Stipa rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky and degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Stipa rechingeri plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates.</p>
