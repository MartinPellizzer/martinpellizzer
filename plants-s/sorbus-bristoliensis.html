                    <h1>Sorbus bristoliensis</h1>
<p>Sorbus bristoliensis, commonly known as the Bristoli's rowan, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the UK.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
