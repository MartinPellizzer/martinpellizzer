<p>Smilax densibarbata, commonly known as the dense-barbed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, barbed spines, which help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Smilax densibarbata is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and thickets.</p>
