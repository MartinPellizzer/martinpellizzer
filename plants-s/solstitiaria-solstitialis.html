                    <h1>Solstitiaria solstitialis</h1>
<p>Solstitiaria solstitialis, commonly known as the summer solstice plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom only during the summer solstice, making it a unique botanical phenomenon. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Solstitiaria solstitialis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
