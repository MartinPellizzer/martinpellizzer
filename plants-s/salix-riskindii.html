                    <h1>Salix riskindii</h1>
<p>Salix riskindii, commonly known as Riskin's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix riskindii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in alpine environments.</p>
