<p>Specklinia spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed tillandsia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
