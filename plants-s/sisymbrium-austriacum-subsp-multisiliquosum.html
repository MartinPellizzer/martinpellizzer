<p>Sisymbrium austriacum subsp.</p>
<p>multisiliquosum, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its leafless stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>Its small, siliquous fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological distribution.</p>
