                    <h1>Salvia aegyptiaca var. pumila</h1>
<p>Salvia aegyptiaca var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Egyptian sage, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet or blue, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
