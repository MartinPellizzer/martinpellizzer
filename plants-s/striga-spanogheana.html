                    <h1>Striga spanogheana</h1>
<p>Striga spanogheana, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of cereal crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces numerous small, yellowish flowers and has a short, annual life cycle. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to weaken and even kill its host.</p>
<p>Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent challenge for farmers.</p>
