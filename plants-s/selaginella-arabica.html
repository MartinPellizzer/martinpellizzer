<p>Selaginella arabica, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporophylls that bear spores. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it exhibits remarkable drought tolerance and can survive in poor soil conditions. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both gametophytic and sporophytic stages.</p>
<p>Selaginella arabica is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
