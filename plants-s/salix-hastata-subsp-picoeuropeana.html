<p>Salix hastata subsp.</p>
<p>picoeuropeana, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires careful management due to its aggressive growth habits.</p>
