                    <h1>Stellera lessertii var. incana</h1>
<p>Stellera lessertii var. incana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The variety incana is distinguished by its notably fuzzy or woolly stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude habitat.</p>
