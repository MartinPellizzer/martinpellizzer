                    <h1>Senecio coursii</h1>
<p>Senecio coursii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio coursii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
