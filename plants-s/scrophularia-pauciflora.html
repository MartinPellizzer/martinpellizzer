<p>Scrophularia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered figwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Scrophularia pauciflora is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
