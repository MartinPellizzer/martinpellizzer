<p>Scirpus atrovirens var. pycnocephalus, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens.</p>
