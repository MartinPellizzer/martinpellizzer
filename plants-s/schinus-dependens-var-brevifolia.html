                    <h1>Schinus dependens var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Schinus dependens var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or  *Pimenta* in Brazil, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage composed of small, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries, which are a key feature in its ecological role. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
