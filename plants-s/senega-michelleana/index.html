                            <h1>Senega Michelleana</h1>
<p>Senega michelleana is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. This member of the legume family is known for its striking violet-blue petals and distinctive pod-like fruit. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy areas along the Atlantic coast. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is now classified as endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>
