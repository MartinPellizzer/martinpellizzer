<p>Stenomesson pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered stenomesson, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces few blooms, typically in shades of yellow and white, which are clustered in a single inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
