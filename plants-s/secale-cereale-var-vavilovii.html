                    <h1>Secale cereale var. vavilovii</h1>
<p>Secale cereale var. vavilovii, commonly known as Vavilov's rye, is a wild relative of cultivated rye (Secale cereale).</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is notable for its genetic diversity and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve rye resilience. It typically grows in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Vavilov's rye is an important resource for understanding the genetic variation within the Secale genus.</p>
