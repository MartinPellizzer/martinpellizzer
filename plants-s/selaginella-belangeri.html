<p>Selaginella belangeri, commonly known as the basket moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Selaginella belangeri plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
