<p>Solanum antacochense, commonly known as the Antacocha nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, adapting to the cool and often humid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum antacochense is considered a rare and understudied species.</p>
