<p>Syringa vulgaris var. rhotomagensis, commonly known as the Rhotomagens lilac, is a variant of the common lilac that is native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, pale lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is more cold-hardy than the common lilac, making it suitable for a wider range of climates.</p>
