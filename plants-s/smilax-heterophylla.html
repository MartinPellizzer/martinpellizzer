<p>Smilax heterophylla, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being arrow-shaped and others more elongated. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are armed with sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Smilax heterophylla is often found in moist woodlands and thickets, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
