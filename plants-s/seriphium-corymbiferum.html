<p>Seriphium corymbiferum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock.</p>
<p>Seriphium corymbiferum plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
