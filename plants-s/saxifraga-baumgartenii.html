<p>Saxifraga baumgartenii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga baumgartenii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and talus slopes at elevations above 2,500 meters.</p>
