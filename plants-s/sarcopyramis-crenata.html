<p>Sarcopyramis crenata, commonly known as the serrated pyramidal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that form a pyramidal shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sarcopyramis crenata is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
