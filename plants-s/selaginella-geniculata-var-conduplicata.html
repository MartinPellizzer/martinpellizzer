                    <h1>Selaginella geniculata var. conduplicata</h1>
<p>Selaginella geniculata var. conduplicata, commonly known as the twocell spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive branching pattern that gives it a unique appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
