<p>Saussurea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>depressa, commonly known as the Alpine safflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
