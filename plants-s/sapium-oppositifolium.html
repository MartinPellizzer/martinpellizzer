<p>Sapium oppositifolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It has a shallow root system and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
