<p>Stapelia gemmiflora, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fleshy flowers that resemble rotting meat, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its flowers typically bloom in summer, opening in the late afternoon and closing at dawn.</p>
<p>Stapelia gemmiflora is also known for its ability to produce offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate.</p>
