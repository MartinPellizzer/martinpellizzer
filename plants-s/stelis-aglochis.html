                    <h1>Stelis aglochis</h1>
<p>Stelis aglochis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of dense foliage. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
