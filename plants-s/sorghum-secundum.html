                    <h1>Sorghum secundum</h1>
<p>Sorghum secundum, commonly known as the slender sorghum, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important crop for livestock feed and biofuel production. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces a fibrous stem that is highly valued for its strength and durability.</p>
<p>Sorghum secundum is also used in traditional basket weaving and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
