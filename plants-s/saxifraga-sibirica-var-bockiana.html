                    <h1>Saxifraga sibirica var. bockiana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga sibirica var. bockiana, commonly known as the Bockian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
