<p>Stelis resupinata, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a short, erect stem with clustered, small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis resupinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
