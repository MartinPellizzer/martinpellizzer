                    <h1>Schizoloma nitens</h1>
<p>Schizoloma nitens, commonly known as the translucent lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a unique botanical structure characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark and rock surfaces in humid, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The thallus is thin and often has a waxy, translucent appearance, which helps in reducing water loss. It lacks distinct rhizines and is composed of a complex network of hyphae that support its growth.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
