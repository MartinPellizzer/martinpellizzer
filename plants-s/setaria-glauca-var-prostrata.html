                    <h1>Setaria glauca var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Setaria glauca var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate green millet, is a low-growing annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
