                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus chantavicus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus chantavicus, commonly known as the globular-headed orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid and often shaded environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
