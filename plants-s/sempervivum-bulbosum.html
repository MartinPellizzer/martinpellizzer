<p>Sempervivum bulbosum, commonly known as the "Alpine Houseplant," is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy rosettes of leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks in the spring, bearing small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Sempervivum bulbosum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh climates, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
