                    <h1>Selaginella borealis f. camtschatica</h1>
<p>Selaginella borealis f. camtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschadenskaya spikemoss, is a rare and cold-hardy fern ally native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping plant with delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
