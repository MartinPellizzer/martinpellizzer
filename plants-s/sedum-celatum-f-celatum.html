<p>Sedum celatum f. celatum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
