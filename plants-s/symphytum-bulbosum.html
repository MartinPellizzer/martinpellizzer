                    <h1>Symphytum bulbosum</h1>
<p>Symphytum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and tubers that store nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, fertile soils. The plant produces erect stems with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its high nutrient content, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a soil amendment.</p>
