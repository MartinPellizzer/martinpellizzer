                    <h1>Schoenoplectus supinus var. lateriflorus</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus supinus var. lateriflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets along the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are often submerged or partially submerged in water.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its lateral flowering pattern, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Schoenoplectus genus.</p>
