                    <h1>Scirpus congdonii var. minor</h1>
<p>Scirpus congdonii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on the water level.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to other Scirpus species, making it a subtle but ecologically important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
