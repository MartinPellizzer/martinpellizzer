                    <h1>Spiranthes misera</h1>
<p>Spiranthes misera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
