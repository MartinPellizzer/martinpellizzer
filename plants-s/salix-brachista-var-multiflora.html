                    <h1>Salix brachista var. multiflora</h1>
<p>Salix brachista var. multiflora, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental plant.</p>
