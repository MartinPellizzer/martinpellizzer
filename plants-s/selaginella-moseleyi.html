                    <h1>Selaginella moseleyi</h1>
<p>Selaginella moseleyi, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes with spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
