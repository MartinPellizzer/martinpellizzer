<p>Stelis triaristata, commonly known as the Three-lobed Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Stelis triaristata is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
