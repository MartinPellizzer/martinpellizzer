                    <h1>Sophronia pterocarpa</h1>
<p>Sophronia pterocarpa, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its fragrant wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in incense and medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
