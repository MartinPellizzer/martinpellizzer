                    <h1>Striga aequinoctialis</h1>
<p>Striga aequinoctialis, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is a significant agricultural pest in Africa. Its life cycle involves producing copious amounts of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature and impact on food security, Striga aequinoctialis remains a major challenge in sustainable agriculture.</p>
