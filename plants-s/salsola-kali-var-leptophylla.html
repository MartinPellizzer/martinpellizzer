                    <h1>Salsola kali var. leptophylla</h1>
<p>Salsola kali var. leptophylla, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, hard, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
