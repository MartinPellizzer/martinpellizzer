<p>Selago swynnertonii var. swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's selago, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
