                            <h1>Scopolia Scopolia</h1>
<p>Scopolia scopolia is a striking perennial plant known for its bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also called the "Queen of the Night" due to its nocturnal fragrance that intensifies in the evening. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potent alkaloids. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
