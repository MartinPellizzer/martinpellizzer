                    <h1>Salix latifolia</h1>
<p>Salix latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a hardy plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix latifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil along waterways.</p>
