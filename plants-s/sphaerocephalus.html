<p>Sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globehead lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often brightly colored thallus, which can range from yellow to orange or red. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Sphaerocephalus is known for its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of forest ecosystems.</p>
