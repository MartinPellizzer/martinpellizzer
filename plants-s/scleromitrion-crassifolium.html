<p>Scleromitrion crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the summer months. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Scleromitrion crassifolium is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
