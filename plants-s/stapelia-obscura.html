                    <h1>Stapelia obscura</h1>
<p>Stapelia obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly face. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stapelia obscura is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
