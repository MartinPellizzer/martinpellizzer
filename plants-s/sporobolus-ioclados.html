<p>Sporobolus ioclados, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a valuable species for erosion control and habitat restoration.</p>
<p>Sporobolus ioclados plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.</p>
