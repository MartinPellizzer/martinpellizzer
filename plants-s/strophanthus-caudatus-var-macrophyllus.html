<p>Strophanthus caudatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leafed African milkvine, is a striking tropical climbing plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains potent cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if misused.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists worldwide.</p>
