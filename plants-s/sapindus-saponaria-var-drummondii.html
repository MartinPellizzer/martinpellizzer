                    <h1>Sapindus saponaria var. drummondii</h1>
<p>Sapindus saponaria var. drummondii, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces fruit capsules that split open to reveal fluffy, white seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of saponins in its seeds, which produce a soapy lather when crushed, giving the plant its common name.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
