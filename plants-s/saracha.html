                    <h1>Saracha</h1>
<p>Saracha, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a rare and elusive species of liverwort.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Saracha lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
