                    <h1>Scleria interrupta</h1>
<p>Scleria interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scleria interrupta is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
