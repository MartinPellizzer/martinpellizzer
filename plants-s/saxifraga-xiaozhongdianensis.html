<p>Saxifraga xiaozhongdianensis, commonly known as the Xiaozhongdian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
