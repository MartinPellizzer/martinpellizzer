                    <h1>Stenorrhynchos aphyllum</h1>
<p>Stenorrhynchos aphyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance, with a single, elongated stem that supports its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its specialized roots to absorb nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
