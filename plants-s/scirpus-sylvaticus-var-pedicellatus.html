                    <h1>Scirpus sylvaticus var. pedicellatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sylvaticus var. pedicellatus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, lake shores, and slow-moving water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that appear in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
