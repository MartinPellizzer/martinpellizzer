The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of these high-altitude rock formations, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually small and革质 (leathery), providing some protection against the strong sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche.</p>
