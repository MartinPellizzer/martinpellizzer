                    <h1>Selaginella potaroensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella potaroensis, commonly known as the Potaro spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern ally native to Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along its stems. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a trait known as heterospory. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is of significant interest for conservation and botanical research.</p>
