<p>Sedum mooneyi, commonly known as the Mooney's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, Sedum mooneyi is a popular choice for desert landscapes.</p>
