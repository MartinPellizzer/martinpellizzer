                    <h1>Scorpiurus sulcatus var. muricatus</h1>
<p>Scorpiurus sulcatus var. muricatus, commonly known as the rough scurvygrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its serrated, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf serrations and a more robust overall structure compared to the typical form of Scorpiurus sulcatus.</p>
