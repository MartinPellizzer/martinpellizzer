                            <h1>Scrophularia Lyrata Var. Parviflora</h1>
<p>Lyreleaf figwort, scientifically known as Scrophularia lyrata var. parviflora, is a striking member of the plant family Scrophulariaceae. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers make it a unique and attractive species. Often overlooked due to its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems. Despite its subtle appearance, the Lyreleaf figwort holds significant value in both ecological and botanical contexts.</p>
