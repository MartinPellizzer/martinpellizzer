                    <h1>Sempervivum sediforme</h1>
<p>Sempervivum sediforme, commonly known as the rosette houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are thick and waxy, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to form clumps make it an excellent ground cover in arid or rocky environments.</p>
