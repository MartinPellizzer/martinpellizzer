                    <h1>Salvia ariana var. calophyta</h1>
<p>Salvia ariana var. calophyta, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is characterized by aromatic oils and square stems.</p>
