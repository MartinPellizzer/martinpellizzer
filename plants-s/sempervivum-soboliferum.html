<p>Sempervivum soboliferum, commonly known as the Wooly Bear or the Mountain House Sempervivum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, woolly coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions.

<p>This hardy succulent is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
