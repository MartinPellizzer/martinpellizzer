                    <h1>Suaeda kocheri</h1>
<p>Suaeda kocheri, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Suaeda kocheri is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in saline habitats.</p>
