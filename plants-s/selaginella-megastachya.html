<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an interesting subject in the study of ancient plant lineages.</p>
