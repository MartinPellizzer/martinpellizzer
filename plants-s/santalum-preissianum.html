                    <h1>Santalum preissianum</h1>
<p>Santalum preissianum, commonly known as the Queensland sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia, it typically grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color.</p>
<p>Its wood is highly valued for its fragrance and is used in the production of incense and essential oils.</p>
