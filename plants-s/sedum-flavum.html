                    <h1>Sedum flavum</h1>
<p>Sedum flavum, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Sedum flavum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
