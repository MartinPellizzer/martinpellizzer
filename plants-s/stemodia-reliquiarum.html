                    <h1>Stemodia reliquiarum</h1>
<p>Stemodia reliquiarum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent stems and small, ephemeral flowers that appear only briefly at night. The plant's botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching structure that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Stemodia reliquiarum is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
