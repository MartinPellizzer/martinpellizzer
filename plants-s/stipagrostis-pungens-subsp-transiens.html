<p>Stipagrostis pungens subsp.</p>
<p>transiens, commonly known as the Transient Needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments.</p>
