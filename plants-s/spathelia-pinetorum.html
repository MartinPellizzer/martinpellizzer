<p>Spathelia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the pine forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often nestled among the roots of pine trees. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Spathelia pinetorum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
