                    <h1>Salsola olgae</h1>
<p>Salsola olgae, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to survive in harsh, saline environments. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or bushy, allowing it to cover large areas of dry land.</p>
<p>Salsola olgae plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
