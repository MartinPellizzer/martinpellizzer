                    <h1>Strychnos quaqua</h1>
<p>Strychnos quaqua, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially dangerous to handle.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution.</p>
