                <h1>Selaginella pallescens</h1>
<p>Selaginella pallescens, commonly known as the bluish spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a common component of understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Selaginella pallescens is also noted for its resilience, capable of withstanding periods of drought due to its specialized water-storing tissues.</p>
