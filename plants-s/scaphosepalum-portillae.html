<p>Scaphosepalum portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendant-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scaphosepalum portillae is primarily found in cloud forests, where it grows epiphytically on trees or rocks.</p>
