<p>Sedum tuberiferum, commonly known as the tuberous sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green and slightly ribbed, adapting to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sedum tuberiferum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
