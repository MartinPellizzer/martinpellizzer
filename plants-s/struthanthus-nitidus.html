<p>Struthanthus nitidus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Struthanthus nitidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
