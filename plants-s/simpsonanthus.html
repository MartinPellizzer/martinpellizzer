                    <h1>Simpsonanthus</h1>
<p>Simpsonanthus, commonly known as the Simpson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Simpsonanthus is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows from the ground rather than on trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
