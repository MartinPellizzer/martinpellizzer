<p>Suaeda conferta, commonly known as saltbush or sea blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, and has specialized adaptations to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces capsules that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Suaeda conferta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
