                            <h1>Sagina Caespitosa</h1>
<p>Sagina caespitosa, commonly known as mossy grass or carpet grass, is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in moist and shady environments. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help prevent soil erosion and support local wildlife. Found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere, this plant is often overlooked for its modest appearance. Despite its size, Sagina caespitosa plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem balance. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for ecological study.</p>
