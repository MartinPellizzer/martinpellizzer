                            <h1>Sorbus Aria Subsp. Scandica</h1>
<p>Whitebeam, scientifically known as Sorbus aria subsp. scandica, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is distinguished by its white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, clustered berries in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and turn a striking yellow or orange in autumn. This hardy and ornamental species is valued for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
