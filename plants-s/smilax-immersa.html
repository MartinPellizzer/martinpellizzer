                    <h1>Smilax immersa</h1>
<p>Smilax immersa, commonly known as the watercress smilax, is a climbing perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to anchor itself to supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a heart-shaped base, often with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Smilax immersa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps, stream banks, and wooded areas.</p>
