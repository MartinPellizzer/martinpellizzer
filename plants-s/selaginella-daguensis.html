                    <h1>Selaginella daguensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella daguensis, commonly known as the Daguena spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobilae, which are cone-like structures containing spores, typical of its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages.</p>
