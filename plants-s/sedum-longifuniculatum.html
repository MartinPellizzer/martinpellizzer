<p>Sedum longifuniculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often branching out into a bushy form. The leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
