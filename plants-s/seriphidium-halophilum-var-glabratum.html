                    <h1>Seriphidium halophilum var. glabratum</h1>
<p>Seriphidium halophilum var. glabratum, commonly known as the coastal dwarf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pale tan seeds dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to thrive in coastal areas with high salinity and low moisture, making it a hardy species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
