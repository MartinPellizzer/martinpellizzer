<p>Salix subpycnostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
