<p>Sempervivum laggeri, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching stems with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Sempervivum laggeri is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and drought.</p>
