                    <h1>Sporobolus pseudairoides</h1>
<p>Sporobolus pseudairoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in drought conditions. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to purple in color.</p>
<p>Blue grama is an important component of native grasslands and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience.</p>
