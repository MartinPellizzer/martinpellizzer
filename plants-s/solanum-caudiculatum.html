<p>Solanum caudiculatum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Solanum caudiculatum contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care.</p>
