                    <h1>Scirpus setaceus var. clathratus</h1>
<p>Scirpus setaceus var. clathratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to erosion control.</p>
<p>The foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
