                    <h1>Sporobolus maritimus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus maritimus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Sporobolus maritimus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
