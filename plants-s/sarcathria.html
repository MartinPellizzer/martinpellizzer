                    <h1>Sarcathria</h1>
<p>Sarcathria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Sarcathria thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
