<p>Saxifraga × sotchensis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga × sotchensis is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
