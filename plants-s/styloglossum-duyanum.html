                    <h1>Styloglossum duyanum</h1>
<p>Styloglossum duyanum, commonly known as the Duyan's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of its habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of pale pink and white, and emit a subtle fragrance to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Styloglossum duyanum is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
