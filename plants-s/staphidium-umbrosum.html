                    <h1>Staphidium umbrosum</h1>
<p>Staphidium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical forests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces small, inconspicuous leaves that help it thrive in low-light conditions. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, Staphidium umbrosum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
