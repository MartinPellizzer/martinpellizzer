<p>Sanguisorba minor subsp.</p>
<p>dictyocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and features lance-shaped leaves with a reddish underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of S. minor.</p>
