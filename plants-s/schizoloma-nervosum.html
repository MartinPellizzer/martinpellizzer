                    <h1>Schizoloma nervosum</h1>
<p>Schizoloma nervosum, commonly known as the veined lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It consists of a thallus with a leathery, lobed appearance, characterized by prominent veins that run through its surface. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its unique growth form. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Schizoloma nervosum is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
