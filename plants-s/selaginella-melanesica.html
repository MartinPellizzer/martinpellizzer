                    <h1>Selaginella melanesica</h1>
<p>Selaginella melanesica, commonly known as the Melanesian spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
