                    <h1>Sarracenia atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Sarracenia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-tongued sarracenia, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and its distinctive, hooded pitchers that are often tinged with purple and red. The plant's leaves form elongated, tubular structures that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to green, and they bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
