<p>Schizachyrium scoparium subsp.</p>
<p>littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale brown seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and tidal flats. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
