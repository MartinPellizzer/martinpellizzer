The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
