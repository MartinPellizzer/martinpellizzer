<p>Salix taiwanalpina var. chingshuishanensis, commonly known as the Chingshuishan willow, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>This willow is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
