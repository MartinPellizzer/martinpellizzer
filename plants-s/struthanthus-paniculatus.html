                    <h1>Struthanthus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Struthanthus paniculatus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are succulent and often branch out into a sprawling or upright form, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Struthanthus paniculatus plays an important role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
