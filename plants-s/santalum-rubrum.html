<p>Santalum rubrum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional crafts and incense.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
