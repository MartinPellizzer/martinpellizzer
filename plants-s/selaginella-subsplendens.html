                    <h1>Selaginella subsplendens</h1>
<p>Selaginella subsplendens, commonly known as the glittering spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
