<p>Symphachne xyroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands, forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 2 millimeters wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it reproduces primarily through rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Symphachne xyroides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
