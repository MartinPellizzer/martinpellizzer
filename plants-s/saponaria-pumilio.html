<p>Saponaria pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the saponins in its roots, which can produce a soapy lather when crushed.</p>
