                    <h1>Scirpus maritimus var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Scirpus maritimus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. This plant thrives in brackish or freshwater wetlands, often growing in muddy or sandy soils along shorelines. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
