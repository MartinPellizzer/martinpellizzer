<p>Setaria caespitosa, commonly known as purple false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果, which are dry, one-seeded fruits. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Setaria caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
