<p>Sesleria caerulea f. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical tussock grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a striking blue-gray color, which helps it stand out in gardens. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as part of a mixed border.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments.</p>
