<p>Sterigmostemum elichrysifolium subsp.</p>
<p>elichrysifolium, commonly known as the goldenleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are usually a vibrant yellow-green color. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
