<p>Salsola soda, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Salsola soda is often considered a weed but is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
