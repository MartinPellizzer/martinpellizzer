                    <h1>Saponaria vulgaris</h1>
<p>Saponaria vulgaris, commonly known as the common soapwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, soap-like pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the saponin compounds in its roots, which produce a soapy lather when crushed.</p>
