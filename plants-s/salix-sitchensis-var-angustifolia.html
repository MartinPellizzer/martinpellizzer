                    <h1>Salix sitchensis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Salix sitchensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
