<p>Sphenopholis interrupta subsp.</p>
<p>californica, commonly known as the California sphenophyll, is a rare and distinctive member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with small, scale-like foliage that is often densely packed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
