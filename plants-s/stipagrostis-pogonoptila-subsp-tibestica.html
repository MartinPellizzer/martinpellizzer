<p>Stipagrostis pogonoptila subsp.</p>
<p>tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a crucial role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>
