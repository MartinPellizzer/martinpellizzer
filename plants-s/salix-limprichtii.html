<p>Salix limprichtii, commonly known as the LÃ¼ders willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
