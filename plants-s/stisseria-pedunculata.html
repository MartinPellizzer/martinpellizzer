                    <h1>Stisseria pedunculata</h1>
<p>Stisseria pedunculata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a triangular cluster at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Stisseria pedunculata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl.</p>
