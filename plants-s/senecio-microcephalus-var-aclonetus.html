                    <h1>Senecio microcephalus var. aclonetus</h1>
<p>Senecio microcephalus var. aclonetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senecio, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and more compact growth structure.</p>
