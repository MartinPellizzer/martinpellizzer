                    <h1>Saxifraga denticulata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga denticulata, commonly known as the toothed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga denticulata is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
