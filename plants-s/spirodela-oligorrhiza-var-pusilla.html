<p>Spirodela oligorrhiza var. pusilla, commonly known as the small spirodela, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of small, round fruits. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in some environments.</p>
