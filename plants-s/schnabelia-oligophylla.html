                    <h1>Schnabelia oligophylla</h1>
<p>Schnabelia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf snub-nose plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology, including the narrow leaves and short, rounded stem, helps it adapt to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
