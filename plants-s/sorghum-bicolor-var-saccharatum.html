<p>Sorghum bicolor var. saccharatum, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its high sugar content in its stalks.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and has been cultivated for centuries for its use in both food and industrial applications. The plant is a tall, robust grass that can grow up to 3â€“5 meters in height, with dense, fibrous stalks. Its leaves are broad and blade-like, and the inflorescence consists of panicles that produce small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>Sweet sorghum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited water resources.</p>
