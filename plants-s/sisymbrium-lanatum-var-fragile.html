                    <h1>Sisymbrium lanatum var. fragile</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium lanatum var. fragile, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant has small, yellow flowers and is typically found in disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces elongated, slender pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
