<p>Sedum nanum, commonly known as dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is ideal for landscaping in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
