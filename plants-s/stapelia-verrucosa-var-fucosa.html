                    <h1>Stapelia verrucosa var. fucosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia verrucosa var. fucosa, commonly known as the sticky stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'fucosa' refers to its hairy or fuzzy appearance, which helps in reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
