<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
