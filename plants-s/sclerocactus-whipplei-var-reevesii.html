<p>Sclerocactus whipplei var. reevesii, commonly known as the Reeves' hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
