<p>Stenocactus heteracanthus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its stems are covered in short, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Stenocactus heteracanthus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
