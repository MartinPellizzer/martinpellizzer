<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp.</p>
<p>smalliana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky and coastal environments, where it forms dense mats to protect itself from harsh weather.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and maritime environments.</p>
