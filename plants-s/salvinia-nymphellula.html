                    <h1>Salvinia nymphellula</h1>
<p>Salvinia nymphellula, commonly known as floating moss, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of finely divided, feather-like leaves that allow it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are borne on specialized, spore-bearing leaves called sporocarps. It is native to regions in Africa and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, it can become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
