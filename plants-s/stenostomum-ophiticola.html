                    <h1>Stenostomum ophiticola</h1>
<p>Stenostomum ophiticola, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Stenostomum ophiticola is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
