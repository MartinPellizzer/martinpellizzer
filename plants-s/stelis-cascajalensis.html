<p>Stelis cascajalensis, commonly known as the Cascajal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
