                    <h1>Spitzelia saharae var. cyrenaica</h1>
<p>Spitzelia saharae var. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Saharan spitzelia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to the deserts of North Africa, particularly in regions of the Sahara and Cyrenaica. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it highly resilient to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
