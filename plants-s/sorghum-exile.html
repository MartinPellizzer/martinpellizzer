<p>Sorghum exile, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and cultivated for its edible grains.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop for regions with limited water resources. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into hard, angular grains used in various food products. Sorghum exile is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its versatility extends to animal feed, biofuel production, and even as a source of fiber for textiles.</p>
