<p>Sporobolus indicus var. saxicola, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear after rainfall. The plant produces small, three-awned spikelets that are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded areas and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
