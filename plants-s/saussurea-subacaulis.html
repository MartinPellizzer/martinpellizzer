<p>Saussurea subacaulis, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, woolly leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces yellow to brown composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Saussurea subacaulis plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
