<p>Schefflera toto, commonly known as the Toto umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves on long petioles. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Schefflera toto is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
