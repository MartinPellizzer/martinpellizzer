<p>Serratula dentata, commonly known as the toothed sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Serratula dentata is an annual herb that can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal.</p>
