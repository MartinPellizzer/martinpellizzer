                    <h1>Sorghum bicolor var. subglabrescens</h1>
<p>Sorghum bicolor var. subglabrescens, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its shorter stature and reduced growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and is cultivated for its high biomass yield and adaptability to arid conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, pale green to brown flowers. It is often used in forage production and as a source of biofuel due to its rapid growth and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it a valuable species in agricultural and ecological studies.</p>
