<p>Swartzia hilairiana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
