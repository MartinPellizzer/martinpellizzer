<p>Saccolabium tenerum, commonly known as the soft thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are woody and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Saccolabium tenerum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure prolonged drought periods.</p>
