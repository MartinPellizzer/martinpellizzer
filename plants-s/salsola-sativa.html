<p>It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
