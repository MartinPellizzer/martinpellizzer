                    <h1>Stictocardia queenslandica</h1>
<p>Stictocardia queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which often has a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. The lichen contains a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
