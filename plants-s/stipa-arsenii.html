                    <h1>Stipa arsenii</h1>
<p>Stipa arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa arsenii is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in such conditions makes it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
