                    <h1>Stapelia gigantea var. pallida</h1>
<p>Stapelia gigantea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, which bloom in late summer. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, a characteristic shared with other stapeliads.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
