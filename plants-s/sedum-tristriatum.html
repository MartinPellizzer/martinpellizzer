<p>Sedum tristriatum, commonly known as the three-striped stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
