                    <h1>Stylocoryna</h1>
<p>Stylocoryna, commonly known as the sandstone plant, is a rare and unique species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle beauty to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Stylocoryna is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
