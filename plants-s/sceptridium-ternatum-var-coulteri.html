                    <h1>Sceptridium ternatum var. coulteri</h1>
<p>Sceptridium ternatum var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its spiky, club-shaped stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, acidic soils within forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
