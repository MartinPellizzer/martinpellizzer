<p>Setaria buchananii, commonly known as false millet, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Setaria buchananii is often mistaken for true millet due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the typical millet grain.</p>
