<p>Strobilanthes dimorphotricha subsp.</p>
<p>dimorphotricha, commonly known as the "Malay ghost orchid," is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specialized insects, and it plays a unique role in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
