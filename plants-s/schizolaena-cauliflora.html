<p>Schizolaena cauliflora, commonly known as the climbing schizolaena, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne along the stems rather than at the ends of branches. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Schizolaena cauliflora is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
