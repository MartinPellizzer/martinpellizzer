<p>Schuitemania merrillii, commonly known as the Kauai mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant relies on a limited number of host trees, primarily species of the genus Acacia, for water and nutrients. Schuitemania merrillii is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments on the island of Kauai.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
