                    <h1>Saltia seddera</h1>
<p>Saltia seddera, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered together. Saltia seddera is well adapted to salty and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded land.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
