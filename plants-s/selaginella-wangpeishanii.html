                    <h1>Selaginella wangpeishanii</h1>
<p>Selaginella wangpeishanii, commonly known as the Wangpeishan spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and specialized structures called strobila, which produce spores. Native to China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid conditions, with a capacity for desiccation tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
