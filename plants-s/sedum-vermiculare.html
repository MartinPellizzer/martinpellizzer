<p>Sedum vermiculare, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sedum vermiculare is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
