                    <h1>Stellarioides sordida</h1>
<p>Stellarioides sordida, commonly known as the dirty starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Stellarioides sordida is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
