<p>Selaginella obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, stem-like structure with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Selaginella obovata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
