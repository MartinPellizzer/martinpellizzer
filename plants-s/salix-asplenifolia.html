                    <h1>Salix asplenifolia</h1>
<p>Salix asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliate willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive leaves, which are ovate to elliptic in shape with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix asplenifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora.</p>
