                    <h1>Suaeda mesopotamica</h1>
<p>Suaeda mesopotamica, commonly known as Mesopotamian saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a halophyte, capable of tolerating high salt concentrations. The plant typically grows in coastal and inland saline environments, often forming dense thickets. Its small, fleshy leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Suaeda mesopotamica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
