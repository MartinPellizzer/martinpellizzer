<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that often extend into the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Sagittaria chilensis is often used in aquatic gardens and can help stabilize sediment in wetlands.</p>
