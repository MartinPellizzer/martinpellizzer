                    <h1>Salix brownii var. tenera</h1>
<p>Salix brownii var. tenera, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and slender, branching stems adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, providing insulation against harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in alpine regions.</p>
