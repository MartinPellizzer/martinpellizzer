                    <h1>Selaginella moritziana var. moritziana</h1>
<p>Selaginella moritziana var. moritziana, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of clubmoss native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce spore-bearing structures called sporophytes. Its leaves are linear and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
