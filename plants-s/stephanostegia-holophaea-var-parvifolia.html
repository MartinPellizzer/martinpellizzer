<p>Stephanostegia holophaea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved stephanostegia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
