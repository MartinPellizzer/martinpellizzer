<p>Stipa capillifolia, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in marginal lands.</p>
