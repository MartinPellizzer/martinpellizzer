                    <h1>Sonchus oleraceus var. triangularis</h1>
<p>Sonchus oleraceus var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, forming a distinctive involucral structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
