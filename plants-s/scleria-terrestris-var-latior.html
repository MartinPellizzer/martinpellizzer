<p>Scleria terrestris var. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers on slender, flowering stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils make it a distinctive component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
