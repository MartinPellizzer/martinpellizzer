<p>Serrafalcus mollis var. contractus, commonly known as the compact serrafalcus, is a unique variant of the serrafalcus species characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits small, ovate leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically a deep green color, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is native to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
