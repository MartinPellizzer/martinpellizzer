                    <h1>Schizoglossum decipiens var. flavum</h1>
<p>Schizoglossum decipiens var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered false orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it grows in wet, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
