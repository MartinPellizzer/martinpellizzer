                    <h1>Salix exigua var. melanopsis</h1>
<p>Salix exigua var. melanopsis, commonly known as black willow or black-twig willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
