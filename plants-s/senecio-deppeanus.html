<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio deppeanus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
