                    <h1>Spiranthes dendroneura</h1>
<p>Spiranthes dendroneura, commonly known as the pineleaf lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having leaf-like structures called bracts.</p>
<p>Spiranthes dendroneura is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, a common trait among orchids.</p>
