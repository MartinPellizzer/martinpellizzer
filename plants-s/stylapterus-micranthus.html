<p>Stylapterus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered stylapterus, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its flowers are small, with a unique structure that includes a specialized lip or labellum, which plays a role in pollination.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Stylapterus micranthus make it an interesting subject for studies on orchid morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
