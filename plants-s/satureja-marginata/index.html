<p>Greek thyme, scientifically known as Satureja marginata, is a fragrant herb native to the rocky regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. This hardy plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herb beds. Its small, oval leaves emit a strong minty aroma, which has been cherished for centuries in culinary and medicinal traditions. Greek thyme is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects to the garden. With its rich history and versatile uses, it remains a beloved plant among gardeners and herbalists alike.</p>
