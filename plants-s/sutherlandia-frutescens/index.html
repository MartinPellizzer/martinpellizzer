                            <h1>Sutherlandia Frutescens</h1>
<p>Cancer bush, scientifically known as Sutherlandia frutescens, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. This plant is notable for its unique appearance, featuring bright yellow flowers and needle-like leaves. It has been traditionally used in African medicine for its purported health benefits. Despite its common name, it is not a true bush but rather a succulent plant. Its cultural and medicinal significance has made it a subject of both interest and controversy in modern herbal medicine.</p>
