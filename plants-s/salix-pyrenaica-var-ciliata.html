                    <h1>Salix pyrenaica var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Salix pyrenaica var. ciliata, commonly known as the Pyrenean willow with ciliate margins, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely hairy margins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
