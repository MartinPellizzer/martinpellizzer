<p>Stylidium calcaratum, commonly known as the sandhill catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and linear leaves, adapted to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils. Its unique feature is the presence of a spurred petal, which is a specialized structure that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Stylidium calcaratum is often found in open habitats such as sandplains and roadsides, where it contributes to the local flora diversity.</p>
