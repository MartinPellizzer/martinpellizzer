<p>Sedum subcapitatum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in compact clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to various garden settings.</p>
