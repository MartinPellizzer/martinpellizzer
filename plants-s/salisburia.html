                    <h1>Salisburia</h1>
<p>Salisburia, commonly known as the giant tree of the Canary Islands, is a unique member of the cypress family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its ability to grow in the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in its dry environment. Salisburia produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
