<p>Spiraea × conferta, commonly known as the weeping spiraea, is a hybrid shrub that combines traits from Spiraea prairie and Spiraea japonica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading, arching branches that bear clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is dark green and provides attractive contrast to the flowering display.</p>
<p>Spiraea × conferta is well-suited for landscaping due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
