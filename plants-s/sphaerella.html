                    <h1>Sphaerella</h1>
<p>Sphaerella, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a genus of foliose lichens characterized by their leaf-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>These lichens typically form a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows them to thrive in various environments. They are often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces, especially in moist, shaded areas. The thallus of Sphaerella is usually green to yellowish in color, with a distinct, layered structure.</p>
<p>Due to their ecological importance, they play a role in nutrient cycling and serve as indicators of air quality.</p>
