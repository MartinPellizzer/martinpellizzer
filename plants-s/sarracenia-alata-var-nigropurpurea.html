                    <h1>Sarracenia alata var. nigropurpurea</h1>
<p>Sarracenia alata var. nigropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-winged pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitchers that are typically red or purple in color, with distinctive purple wings along the edges. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized traps that secrete a digestive enzyme to break down insect prey. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
