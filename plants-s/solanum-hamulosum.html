                    <h1>Solanum hamulosum</h1>
<p>Solanum hamulosum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, red berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially dangerous if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>Solanum hamulosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
