                    <h1>Serrafalcus squarrosus var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus squarrosus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
