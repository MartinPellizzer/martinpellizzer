<p>Strychnos niamniamensis, commonly known as the African bitter apple, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution.</p>
