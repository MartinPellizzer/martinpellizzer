                    <h1>Salix subcaprea</h1>
<p>Salix subcaprea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Salix subcaprea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
