<p>Seticereus roezlii, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ridged, green stems that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Seticereus roezlii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions.</p>
