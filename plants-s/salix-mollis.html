<p>Salix mollis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
<p>Salix mollis is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
