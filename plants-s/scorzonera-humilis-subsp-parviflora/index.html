                            <h1>Scorzonera Humilis Subsp. Parviflora</h1>
<p>Common scorzonera, scientifically known as Scorzonera humilis subsp. parviflora, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems, small pale yellow flowers, and distinctive tuberous roots that resemble those of the globe artichoke. This plant thrives in rocky soils and high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it has attracted interest from botanists and gardeners alike. Despite its hardy nature, it remains a relatively rare and underappreciated species in modern horticulture.</p>
