                    <h1>Styphelia blakei</h1>
<p>Styphelia blakei, commonly known as the Blake's snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Styphelia blakei thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral communities.</p>
<p>It is a relatively rare species, making it a notable plant for botanists and conservationists.</p>
