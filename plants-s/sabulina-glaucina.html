                    <h1>Sabulina glaucina</h1>
<p>Sabulina glaucina, commonly known as the blue sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Sabulina glaucina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
