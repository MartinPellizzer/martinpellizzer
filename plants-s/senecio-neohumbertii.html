                    <h1>Senecio neohumbertii</h1>
<p>Senecio neohumbertii, commonly known as the Mountain Senecio, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fluffy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its specific growing requirements, it is relatively rare in cultivation outside its native habitat.</p>
