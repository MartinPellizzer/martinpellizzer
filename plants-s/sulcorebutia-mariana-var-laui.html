                    <h1>Sulcorebutia mariana var. laui</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia mariana var. laui, commonly known as the Laui's desert rose, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a woolly coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent leaves are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
