                    <h1>Sibbaldia procumbens var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia procumbens var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops.</p>
