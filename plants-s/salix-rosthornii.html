                    <h1>Salix rosthornii</h1>
<p>Salix rosthornii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a small shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its bark is thin and peeling, and it has a shallow root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Salix rosthornii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
