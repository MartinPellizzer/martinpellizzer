<p>Scleria georgiana subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the Australian marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering structure compared to other Scleria species.</p>
