                    <h1>Salix alaxensis var. longistylis</h1>
<p>Salix alaxensis var. longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled willow, is a variant of the Alaska willow.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to the Yukon and Alaska regions of North America. The plant features slender, often multi-branched stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, with the male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic of wind-pollinated species.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its elongated stigmas, which are adapted for effective pollination in its harsh, arctic environment.</p>
