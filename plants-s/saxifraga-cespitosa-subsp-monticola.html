<p>Saxifraga cespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>monticola, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant forms dense cushions or mats, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh mountain environments, demonstrating resilience to wind, cold, and poor soil conditions.</p>
