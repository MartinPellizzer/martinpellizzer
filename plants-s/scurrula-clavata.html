<p>Scurrula clavata, commonly known as the club-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a distinctive club-like or branched structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Scurrula clavata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution and environmental changes.</p>
