                    <h1>Steganthera parvifolia</h1>
<p>Steganthera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms a dense mat of foliage close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Steganthera parvifolia is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
