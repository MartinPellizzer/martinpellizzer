                    <h1>Sisymbrium ferreyrae</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is native to arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
