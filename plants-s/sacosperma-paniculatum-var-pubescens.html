                    <h1>Sacosperma paniculatum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Sacosperma paniculatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sago palm, is a variant of the sago palm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately arranged leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which contain the toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in tropical climates.</p>
<p>However, its seeds contain cycasin, a toxin that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
