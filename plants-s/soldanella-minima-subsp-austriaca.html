<p>Soldanella minima subsp.</p>
<p>austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of tiny, clustered leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine flora species.</p>
