<p>Solenopsis minuta subsp.</p>
<p>nobilis, commonly known as the noble fire ant, is a subspecies of the fire ant native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, reddish-brown body and a distinctive, elongated waist that separates the thorax from the abdomen.</p>
<p>This species is known for its aggressive behavior and ability to form large, complex colonies. The queen is typically larger than the workers and is responsible for reproduction within the colony.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is not a plant but an insect, so its study falls under entomology rather than botany.</p>
