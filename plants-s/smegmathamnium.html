                    <h1>Smegmathamnium</h1>
<p>Smegmathamnium, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often found clinging to the bark of ancient trees. The plant's fronds are characterized by their silvery-white undersides, which shimmer under indirect light, giving it its poetic name. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Smegmathamnium is considered a conservation concern.</p>
