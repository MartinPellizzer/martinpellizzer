<p>Scleranthus serotinus, commonly known as late thornweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and has a distinctive appearance with slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It has a fibrous root system and hairy leaves, which help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Scleranthus serotinus is often found in temperate climates and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
