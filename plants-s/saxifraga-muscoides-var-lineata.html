<p>Saxifraga muscoides var. lineata, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora.</p>
