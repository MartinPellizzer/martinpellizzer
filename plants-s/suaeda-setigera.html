<p>Suaeda setigera, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Suaeda setigera plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
