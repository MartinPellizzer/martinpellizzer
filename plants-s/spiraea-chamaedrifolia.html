                    <h1>Spiraea chamaedrifolia</h1>
<p>Spiraea chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Spiraea chamaedrifolia is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
