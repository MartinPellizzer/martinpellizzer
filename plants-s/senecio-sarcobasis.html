                    <h1>Senecio sarcobasis</h1>
<p>Senecio sarcobasis, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Senecio sarcobasis is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
