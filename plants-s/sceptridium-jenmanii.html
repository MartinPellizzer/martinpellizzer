<p>Sceptridium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herb with a creeping stem that produces upright, spore-bearing cones. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of tiny, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sceptridium jenmanii is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
