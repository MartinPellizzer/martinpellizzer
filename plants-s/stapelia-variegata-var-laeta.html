                    <h1>Stapelia variegata var. laeta</h1>
<p>Stapelia variegata var. laeta, commonly known as the variegated star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, a feature common in many succulents to reduce water evaporation.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal care.</p>
