<p>Stipa meridionalis, commonly known as the southern needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Stipa meridionalis is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
