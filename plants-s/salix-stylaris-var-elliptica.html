                    <h1>Salix stylaris var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Salix stylaris var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
