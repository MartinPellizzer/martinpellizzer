                    <h1>Synaphea preissii</h1>
<p>Synaphea preissii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or decaying wood.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Synaphea preissii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
