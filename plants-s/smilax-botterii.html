<p>Smilax botterii, commonly known as the prickly pear vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Smilax botterii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
