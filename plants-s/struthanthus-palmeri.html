                    <h1>Struthanthus palmeri</h1>
<p>Struthanthus palmeri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and relies on pollinators like bees and moths for reproduction.</p>
