                    <h1>Sphacophyllum pratense</h1>
<p>Sphacophyllum pratense, commonly known as the marsh thyme, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in association with other bog plants such as sphagnum moss and heather.</p>
<p>Sphacophyllum pratense plays a role in stabilizing peat soils and supporting local biodiversity in its specialized habitat.</p>
