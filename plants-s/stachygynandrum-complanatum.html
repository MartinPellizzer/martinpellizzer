                    <h1>Stachygynandrum complanatum</h1>
<p>Stachygynandrum complanatum, commonly known as the flat-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Stachygynandrum complanatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
