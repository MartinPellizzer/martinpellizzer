<p>Strombocarpa strombulifera var. ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's sea holly, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
