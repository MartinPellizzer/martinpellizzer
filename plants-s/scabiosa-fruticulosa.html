<p>Scabiosa fruticulosa, commonly known as the wood avens, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scabiosa fruticulosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
