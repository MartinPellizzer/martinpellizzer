<p>Scilla maculata, commonly known as the spotted scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant's bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive harsh winters and regrow each year. Scilla maculata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate floral display.</p>
