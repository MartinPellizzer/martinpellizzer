<p>Selaginella hupehensis, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Selaginella hupehensis is also notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and fire, due to its unique reproductive and physiological adaptations.</p>
