                    <h1>Salix luctuosa</h1>
<p>Salix luctuosa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and elegant look. The tree produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Salix luctuosa is often planted near water bodies due to its ability to tolerate moist soils and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
