                    <h1>Sarcocaulon rigidum</h1>
<p>Sarcocaulon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, making it a temporary and elusive species.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments where its hosts thrive.</p>
