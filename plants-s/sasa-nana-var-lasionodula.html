                    <h1>Sasa nana var. lasionodula</h1>
<p>Sasa nana var. lasionodula, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats or small colonies, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly hairy leaves and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates.</p>
