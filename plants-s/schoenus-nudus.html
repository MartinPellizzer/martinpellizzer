                    <h1>Schoenus nudus</h1>
<p>Schoenus nudus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Schoenus nudus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
