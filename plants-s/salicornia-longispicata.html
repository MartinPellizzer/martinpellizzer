                    <h1>Salicornia longispicata</h1>
<p>Salicornia longispicata, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. It is found along coastal areas and in salt marshes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of marine and estuarine ecosystems.</p>
