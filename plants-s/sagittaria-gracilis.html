<p>Sagittaria gracilis, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in shallow water. The plant has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or emerge from the water. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters above the water, and it produces tiny, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water currents.</p>
<p>Sagittaria gracilis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
