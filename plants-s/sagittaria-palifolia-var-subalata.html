                    <h1>Sagittaria palifolia var. subalata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria palifolia var. subalata, commonly known as the slender arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water, adding a delicate ornamental quality. Its roots help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>The variety subalata is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Sagittaria species.</p>
