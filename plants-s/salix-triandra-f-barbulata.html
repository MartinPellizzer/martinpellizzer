                    <h1>Salix triandra f. barbulata</h1>
<p>Salix triandra f. barbulata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its distinctive, silky-hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
