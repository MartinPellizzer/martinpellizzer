<p>Saxicolella amicorum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and green algae.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often growing on bare stone surfaces in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate, allowing it to withstand extreme conditions. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
