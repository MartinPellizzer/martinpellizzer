                    <h1>Sorbus aucuparia f. heteromorpha</h1>
<p>Sorbus aucuparia f. heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable rowan or a variant of the common whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted branches and small, aggregate fruits that turn from red to orange or yellow in autumn. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins, and the plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring. This form exhibits morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape and fruit size, making it a notable example of intraspecific diversity.</p>
<p>It thrives in woodland edges and rocky soils, often growing in partial shade.</p>
