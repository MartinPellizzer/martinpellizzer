<p>Sedum album subsp.</p>
<p>gypsicola, commonly known as the chalk sedum, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in calcareous soils, often found in coastal areas or on limestone cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
