<p>Schefflera littorea, commonly known as the coastal schefflera, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often borne on short, hairy peduncles. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Schefflera littorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
