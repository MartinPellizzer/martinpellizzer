<p>Siderodendron macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard wood and ecological importance, it is sometimes harvested for timber, though it is also valued for its role in local ecosystems.</p>
