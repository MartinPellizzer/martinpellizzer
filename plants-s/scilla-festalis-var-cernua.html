                    <h1>Scilla festalis var. cernua</h1>
<p>Scilla festalis var. cernua, commonly known as the nodding scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that hang downward, giving it its "nodding" appearance. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, often growing in rocky or woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms.</p>
<p>The variety cernua is distinguished by its drooping flowers, which set it apart from other scilla species.</p>
