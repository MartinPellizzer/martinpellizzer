<p>Sagraea plumosa, commonly known as the silver feather plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage that gives it its common name. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to fine, soft hairs covering the surface. Sagraea plumosa produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
