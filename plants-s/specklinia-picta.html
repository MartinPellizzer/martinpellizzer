                <h1>Specklinia picta</h1>
<p>Specklinia picta, commonly known as the speckled lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, speckled green leaves and a unique, showy orchid flower with a deep purple pouch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a rare beauty to the forest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Specklinia picta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
