<p>Sapium obtusatum, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in catkin-like clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its fast growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
