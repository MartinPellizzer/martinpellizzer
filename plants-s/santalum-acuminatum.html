                    <h1>Santalum acuminatum</h1>
<p>Santalum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine furniture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, tropical, and subtropical regions.</p>
