                    <h1>Salix disperma</h1>
<p>Salix disperma, commonly known as the scattered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, Salix disperma plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
