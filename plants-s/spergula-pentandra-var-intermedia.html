                    <h1>Spergula pentandra var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Spergula pentandra var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. The plant features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color. It produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and disturbed environments.</p>
