                    <h1>Stevia febrifuga</h1>
<p>Stevia febrifuga, commonly known as bitter stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other stevia species due to its lower sweetness and more bitter taste.</p>
