                    <h1>Symphyllia siletiana var. trichantha</h1>
<p>Symphyllia siletiana var. trichantha, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, trichotomous leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology includes small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
