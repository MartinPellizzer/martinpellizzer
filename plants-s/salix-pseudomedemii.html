                    <h1>Salix pseudomedemii</h1>
<p>Salix pseudomedemii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
