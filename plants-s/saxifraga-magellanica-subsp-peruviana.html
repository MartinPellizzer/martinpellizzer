<p>Saxifraga magellanica subsp.</p>
<p>peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of succulent foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
