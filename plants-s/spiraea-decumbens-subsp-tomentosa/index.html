                            <h1>Spiraea Decumbens Subsp. Tomentosa</h1>
<p>Tomentose spiraea, scientifically known as Spiraea decumbens subsp. tomentosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This plant thrives in rocky soils and alpine environments, often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations. Its delicate, clusters of white or pink flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it has become a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
