                    <h1>Sparganium perpusillum</h1>
<p>Sparganium perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf bur reed, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, which are often covered in soft, spiny bracts. Its fruits are cylindrical, spiny burrs that can adhere to the fur of animals or the clothing of humans.</p>
<p>Sparganium perpusillum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
