<p>Silvia sprucei, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-white on the underside of the leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silvia sprucei thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
