                    <h1>Selaginella nutans var. grandiscapia</h1>
<p>Selaginella nutans var. grandiscapia, commonly known as the drooping spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its wiry, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, that contain both microspores and megaspores for sexual reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
