                            <h1>Stylomecon Heterophylla</h1>
<p>Stylomecon heterophylla is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is known for its strikingly different leaf shapes, which vary dramatically between its stems and leaves. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Despite its beauty, it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this remarkable species for future generations.</p>
