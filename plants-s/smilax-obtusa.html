                    <h1>Smilax obtusa</h1>
<p>Smilax obtusa, commonly known as blunt spurge or smooth smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, thornless stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various birds and wildlife. Smilax obtusa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
