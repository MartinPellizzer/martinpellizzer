                    <h1>Saxifraga comosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga comosa, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like vegetation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga comosa is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
