                    <h1>Sedum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Sedum tuberculatum, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and hardiness, Sedum tuberculatum is well-suited for xeriscaping and conservation gardens.</p>
