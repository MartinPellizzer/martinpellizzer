                    <h1>Solanum lyratum</h1>
<p>Solanum lyratum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
