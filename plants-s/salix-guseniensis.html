<p>Salix guseniensis, commonly known as the Gusen River willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
