<p>Sarcochilus tridentatus, commonly known as the Trident Lip, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its moist, shaded habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in summer. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in clusters, anchoring it to rocky or forested substrates.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its distinctive three-lobed lip, which gives it its common name.</p>
