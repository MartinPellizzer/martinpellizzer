<p>Schoenus erraticus, commonly known as the erratic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Schoenus erraticus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
