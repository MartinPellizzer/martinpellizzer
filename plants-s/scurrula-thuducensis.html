                    <h1>Scurrula thuducensis</h1>
<p>Scurrula thuducensis, commonly known as the Namibian horned lichen, is a unique lichen that thrives in the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive horn-like structures, which are formed by the growth of the fungal component over the algal partner. This plant is a composite organism, consisting of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, including high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>Scurrula thuducensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
