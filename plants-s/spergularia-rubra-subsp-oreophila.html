<p>Spergularia rubra subsp.</p>
<p>oreophila, commonly known as the alpine sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a compact growth habit, which helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
