                    <h1>Spartina × neyrautii</h1>
<p>Spartina × neyrautii, commonly known as the hybrid cordgrass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Spartina alterniflora and Spartina foliosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like structure with dense, overlapping leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is typically found in intertidal zones, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. Spartina × neyrautii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and reducing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in certain regions has raised ecological concerns.</p>
