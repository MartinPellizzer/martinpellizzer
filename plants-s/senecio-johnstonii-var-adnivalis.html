<p>Senecio johnstonii var. adnivalis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the high-elevation regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
