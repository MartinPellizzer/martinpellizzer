                            <h1>Sabina Comitana</h1>
<p>Chinese juniper, scientifically known as Sabina comitana, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that provide year-round foliage. Often used in traditional Chinese horticulture, it is also a popular choice for ornamental gardening. With its resilience and aesthetic appeal, the Chinese juniper remains a cherished plant in both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
