                    <h1>Spiranthes ekmanii</h1>
<p>Spiranthes ekmanii, commonly known as the small spiraling orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the orchid family native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. This species typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as seeps and meadows, often in areas with well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is pollinated by small flies and bees, relying on its subtle floral scent and structure for reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
