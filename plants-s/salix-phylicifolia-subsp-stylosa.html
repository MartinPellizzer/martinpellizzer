<p>Salix phylicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>stylosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in riparian habitats.</p>
