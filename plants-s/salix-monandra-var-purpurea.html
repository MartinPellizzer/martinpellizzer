<p>Salix monandra var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that turn a striking purplish-red color in the autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are followed by white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration due to its ability to thrive in moist to wet soil conditions.</p>
