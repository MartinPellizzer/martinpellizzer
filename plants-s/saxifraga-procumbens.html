<p>Saxifraga procumbens, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga procumbens is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
