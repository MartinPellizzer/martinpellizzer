                    <h1>Stenopadus neblinensis</h1>
<p>Stenopadus neblinensis, commonly known as the cloud forest fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a typical inhabitant of montane ecosystems. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of most ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenopadus neblinensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
