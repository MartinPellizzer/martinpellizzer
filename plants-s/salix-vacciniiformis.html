                    <h1>Salix vacciniiformis</h1>
<p>Salix vacciniiformis, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
