<p>Selaginella calcarata, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are often tightly packed, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a unique ability to enter a state of dormancy during periods of drought.</p>
<p>Selaginella calcarata is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
