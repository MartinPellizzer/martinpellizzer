<p>Seddera secundiflora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and the ability to store water.</p>
<p>Seddera secundiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
