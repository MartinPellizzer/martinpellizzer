                    <h1>Spiranthes alticola</h1>
<p>Spiranthes alticola, commonly known as the mountain ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. This plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
