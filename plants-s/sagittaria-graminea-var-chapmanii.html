                    <h1>Sagittaria graminea var. chapmanii</h1>
<p>Sagittaria graminea var. chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the waterline. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life.</p>
