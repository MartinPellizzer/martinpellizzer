<p>Salix lingulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as streambanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Salix lingulata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
