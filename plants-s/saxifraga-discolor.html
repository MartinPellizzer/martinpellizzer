                    <h1>Saxifraga discolor</h1>
<p>Saxifraga discolor, commonly known as the white-stemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga discolor is valued for its frost resistance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
