<p>Salix lanata subsp.</p>
<p>calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and flexible, often pendulous branches.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
