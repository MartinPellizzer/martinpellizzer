The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Sophia myriophylla is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils.</p>
