                    <h1>Striga gastonii</h1>
<p>Striga gastonii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistence as a weed.</p>
<p>Striga gastonii is a significant agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa, where it reduces crop yields and poses challenges for sustainable farming.</p>
