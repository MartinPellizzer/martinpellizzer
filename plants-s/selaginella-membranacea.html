                    <h1>Selaginella membranacea</h1>
<p>Selaginella membranacea, commonly known as the maidenhair spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that are often bright green and have a leathery texture. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle.</p>
<p>Selaginella membranacea is also notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing tissues.</p>
