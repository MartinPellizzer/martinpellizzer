                    <h1>Saccolabium gracile</h1>
<p>Saccolabium gracile, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Saccolabium gracile plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for specific butterfly species.</p>
