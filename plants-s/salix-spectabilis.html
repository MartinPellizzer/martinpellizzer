                    <h1>Salix spectabilis</h1>
<p>Salix spectabilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn a striking yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The weeping willow is often planted near water sources due to its ability to tolerate moist soils and its ornamental value.</p>
