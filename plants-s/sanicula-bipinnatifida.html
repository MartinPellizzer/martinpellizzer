<p>Sanicula bipinnatifida, commonly known as the twin-lobed sanicle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into two rows of smaller lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually white or pale green, bloom in early spring and are followed by small, dry fruits.</p>
