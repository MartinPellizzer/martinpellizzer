<p>Coral bells, scientifically known as Sarcopodium triflorum, are a striking addition to any garden or indoor space. These plants are named for their vibrant, bell-shaped foliage that resembles coral in color and texture. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, they thrive in cool, moist environments. Their ability to flourish in partial shade makes them versatile for a variety of planting conditions. With their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, Coral bells are a popular choice among both novice and experienced gardeners.</p>
