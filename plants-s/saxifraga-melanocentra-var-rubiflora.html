                    <h1>Saxifraga melanocentra var. rubiflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga melanocentra var. rubiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, often pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
