                    <h1>Stapelia ocellata</h1>
<p>Stapelia ocellata, commonly known as the "Lion's Head" or "Tiger's Head" plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble the head of a lion or tiger, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Stapelia ocellata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
