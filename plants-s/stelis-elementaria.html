                    <h1>Stelis elementaria</h1>
<p>Stelis elementaria, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a short, erect stem with several leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
