<p>Sphaerostephanos pterosporus var. crenatus, commonly known as the crested starburst cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense clusters of small, spiny areoles that bear white flowers. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
