The plant has a low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
