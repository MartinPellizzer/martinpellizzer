                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. infectum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. infectum, commonly known as the infected potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato characterized by its unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a range of abnormalities, including twisted stems, malformed leaves, and irregular tuber shapes, often resulting from viral infections. The plant typically shows stunted growth and may have a reduced yield compared to standard potato varieties. Its development is influenced by factors such as viral pathogens and environmental stress.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it remains a subject of study in plant pathology and genetics.</p>
