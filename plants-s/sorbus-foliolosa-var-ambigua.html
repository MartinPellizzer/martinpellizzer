                    <h1>Sorbus foliolosa var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Sorbus foliolosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous leaf whitebeam, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
