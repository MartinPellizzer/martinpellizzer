                    <h1>Salix acutibasis</h1>
<p>Salix acutibasis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its male and female flowers, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks or in forested areas. Salix acutibasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
