<p>Sphaerostephanos uaniensis, commonly known as the Uaniensis Globeflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters around the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Sphaerostephanos uaniensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
