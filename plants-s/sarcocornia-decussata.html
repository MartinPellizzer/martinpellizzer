                    <h1>Sarcocornia decussata</h1>
<p>Sarcocornia decussata, commonly known as saltwort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and tidal flats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and salt, allowing it to survive in high-salinity conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Sarcocornia decussata plays an important ecological role in salt marsh ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
