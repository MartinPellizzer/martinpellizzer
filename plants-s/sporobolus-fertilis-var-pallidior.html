                    <h1>Sporobolus fertilis var. pallidior</h1>
<p>Sporobolus fertilis var. pallidior, commonly known as the paleleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and pale green to silver-blue foliage, which helps it reflect intense sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds, facilitating its spread across sandy and gravelly soils. It has adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions, making it a common component of desert and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its low-growing structure and drought tolerance make it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
