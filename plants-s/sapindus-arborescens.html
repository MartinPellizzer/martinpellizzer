<p>Sapindus arborescens, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a starchy, soap-like pulp. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap substitute due to its saponin content.</p>
