                    <h1>Smilax benthamiana</h1>
<p>Smilax benthamiana, commonly known as the Bentham arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Smilax in the family Araceae, characterized by its woody stems and spiny projections. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they contain compounds that can be harmful if not prepared properly.</p>
<p>Smilax benthamiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
