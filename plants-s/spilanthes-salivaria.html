                    <h1>Spilanthes salivaria</h1>
<p>Spilanthes salivaria, commonly known as the "stinging grass" or "Mexican devil's lettuce," is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of specialized cells on the leaves and stems that release a pungent, irritant compound when touched.</p>
<p>This unique characteristic makes it both a subject of scientific interest and a plant with traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
