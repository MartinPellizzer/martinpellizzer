                    <h1>Schmidtottia involucrata var. moaensis</h1>
<p>Schmidtottia involucrata var. moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
