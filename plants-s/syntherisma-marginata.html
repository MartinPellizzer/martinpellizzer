                    <h1>Syntherisma marginata</h1>
<p>Syntherisma marginata, commonly known as the marginated syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a preference for moist, shaded environments in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Syntherisma marginata is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
