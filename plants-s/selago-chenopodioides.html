                    <h1>Selago chenopodioides</h1>
<p>Selago chenopodioides, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are often reduced to scales or spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Selago chenopodioides is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of extreme drought and high temperatures.</p>
