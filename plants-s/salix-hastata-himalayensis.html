<p>Salix hastata himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
