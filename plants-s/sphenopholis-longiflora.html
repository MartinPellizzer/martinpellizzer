<p>Sphenopholis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Sphenopholis longiflora typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its presence indicates a healthy ecosystem, as it thrives in undisturbed, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
