<p>Sclerochloa multiculmis subsp.</p>
<p>borreri, commonly known as the Borriâ€™s wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage that forms compact clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, rigid, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions.</p>
