                    <h1>Scleria melanotricha var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Scleria melanotricha var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or damp environments.</p>
<p>The smooth, glabrous leaves of this variety distinguish it from other similar species within the genus Scleria.</p>
