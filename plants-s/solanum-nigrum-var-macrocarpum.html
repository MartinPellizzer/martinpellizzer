                    <h1>Solanum nigrum var. macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Solanum nigrum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of black, berry-like fruits. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
