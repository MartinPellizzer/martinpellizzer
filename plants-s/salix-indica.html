<p>Salix indica, commonly known as the Indian willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and often grayish in appearance, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix indica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
