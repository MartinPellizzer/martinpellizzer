<p>Scirpus mucronatus subsp.</p>
<p>robustus, commonly known as the robust tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense tussocks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, triangular spikelets that are typically arranged in three rows along the stem. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
