                    <h1>Sassafras sassafras</h1>
<p>Sassafras sassafras, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are alternate and have a distinctive notched or lobed appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by red, spherical berries that contain several seeds. Its roots and bark contain compounds such as safrole, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential toxicity, the use of sassafras in modern applications is limited.</p>
