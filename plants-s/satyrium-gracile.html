<p>Satyrium gracile, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender flower stem.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
