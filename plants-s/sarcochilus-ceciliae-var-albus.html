<p>Sarcochilus ceciliae var. albus, commonly known as the White Cecilia orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer, often with a subtle pink or purple tinge. The plant has a compact growth habit with broad, strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
