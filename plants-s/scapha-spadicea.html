                    <h1>Scapha spadicea</h1>
<p>Scapha spadicea, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The golden cup fern is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
