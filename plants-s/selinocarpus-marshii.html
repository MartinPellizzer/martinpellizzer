                    <h1>Selinocarpus marshii</h1>
<p>Selinocarpus marshii, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as swamps, bogs, and streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Selinocarpus marshii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
