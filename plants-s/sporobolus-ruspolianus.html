                    <h1>Sporobolus ruspolianus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus ruspolianus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and spikelets that are often covered in fine bristles. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>Sporobolus ruspolianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
