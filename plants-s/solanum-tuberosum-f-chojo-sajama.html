                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. chojo-sajama</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. chojo-sajama, commonly known as the Chojo-Sajama potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato characterized by its unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, specifically in Bolivia and Peru, where it has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, and its tubers are typically smaller and more uniformly shaped compared to standard potatoes. It is valued for its resilience to cold climates and its potential for genetic diversity in breeding programs.</p>
<p>This cultivar also holds cultural significance among local communities in the Andean region.</p>
