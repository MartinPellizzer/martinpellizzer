                    <h1>Sciothamnus</h1>
<p>Sciothamnus, commonly known as the silver sagebrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plants are typically shrubs with silvery-gray foliage, which helps them retain moisture in arid environments. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Sciothamnus species are adapted to dry, rocky soils and are often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
