<p>Stuckenia pectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments.</p>
<p>Stuckenia pectinata is an important species for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
