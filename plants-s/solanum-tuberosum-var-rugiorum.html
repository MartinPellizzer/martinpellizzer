                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. rugiorum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. rugiorum, commonly known as the rough-skinned potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its distinctive, rugged, and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. Its tubers are typically smaller and have a more irregular shape compared to standard potato varieties. The leaves are usually darker green and have a coarser texture, which contributes to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated commercially but is of interest to botanists and gardeners for its ornamental and genetic value.</p>
