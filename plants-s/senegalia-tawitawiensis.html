<p>Senegalia tawitawiensis, commonly known as the Tawitawi acacia, is a shrub native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Tawitawi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and is adapted to grow in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of small, feather-like leaflets, and the plant is often used in local landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Senegalia tawitawiensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
