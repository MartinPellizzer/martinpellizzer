                    <h1>Selaginella springiana var. tumida</h1>
<p>Selaginella springiana var. tumida, commonly known as the cushion spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions, making it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
