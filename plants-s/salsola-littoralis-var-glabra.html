                    <h1>Salsola littoralis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Salsola littoralis var. glabra, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, glabrous leaves that reduce water loss and tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline soils along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh coastal habitats.</p>
