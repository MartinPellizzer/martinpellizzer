                    <h1>Saurauia herthae</h1>
<p>Saurauia herthae, commonly known as the Herth's evergreen mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily dipterocarps, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Saurauia herthae plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy.</p>
