                    <h1>Schizoloma fraseri</h1>
<p>Schizoloma fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's lichen, is a member of the lichen family, specifically the genus Schizoloma.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen, forming a tightly adherent, foliose or crust-like growth on rock surfaces. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often on calcareous substrates. Its thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>Schizoloma fraseri is relatively rare and is of interest to mycologists due to its unique ecological and morphological characteristics.</p>
