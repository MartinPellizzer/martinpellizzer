                    <h1>Selaginella martensii var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Selaginella martensii var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette-like structure with spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced in small, cone-like structures called strobila. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
