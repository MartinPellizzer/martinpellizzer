<p>Staavia trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant grows in grassland and rocky habitats, often forming dense mats or clumps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in the environment.</p>
<p>Staavia trichotoma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
