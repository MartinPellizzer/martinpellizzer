<p>Syzygium canicortex, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters and has elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its small, fragrant flowers are white or pink and are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitats.</p>
