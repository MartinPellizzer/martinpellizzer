                    <h1>Siphocampylus clotho</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus clotho, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shaded, humid environments. Its unique botanical structure makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is rarely found in the wild and is often cultivated in controlled settings.</p>
