                    <h1>Saxifraga melanocentra f. pluriflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga melanocentra f. pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered saxifrage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
