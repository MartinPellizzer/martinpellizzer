                            <h1>Siler Garganicum</h1>
<p>Siler garganicum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils along streams and forest edges. Known for its small, pale blue flowers, it blooms in late spring and early summer. The plant is highly valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Siler garganicum is now considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
