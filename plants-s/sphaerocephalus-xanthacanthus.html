<p>Sphaerocephalus xanthacanthus, commonly known as the golden thimble cactus, is a unique species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are often clustered at the top of the stems. Its compact growth habit makes it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
