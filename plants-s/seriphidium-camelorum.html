<p>Seriphidium camelorum, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Seriphidium camelorum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
