                    <h1>Sisymbrium patulum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium patulum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats.</p>
