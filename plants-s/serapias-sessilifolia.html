<p>Serapias sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, giving it a compact appearance.</p>
<p>Serapias sessilifolia is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
