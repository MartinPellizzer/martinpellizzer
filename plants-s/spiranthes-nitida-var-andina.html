The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
