<p>Salix reinii subsp.</p>
<p>tontomussirensis, commonly known as the Tontomussirensis willow, is a rare subspecies native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
