The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Selago capitellata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
