                    <h1>Santolina squarrosa</h1>
<p>Santolina squarrosa, commonly known as squarrosa santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and resistance to pests.</p>
<p>Santolina squarrosa is also valued for its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal in landscaping.</p>
