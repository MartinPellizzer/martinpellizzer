                    <h1>Secale villosum</h1>
<p>Secale villosum, commonly known as hairy ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Secale villosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
