                    <h1>Stenoptera actinosophila</h1>
<p>Stenoptera actinosophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is classified as vulnerable, highlighting the need for habitat preservation.</p>
