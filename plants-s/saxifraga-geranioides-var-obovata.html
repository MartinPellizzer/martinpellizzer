<p>Saxifraga geranioides var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, waxy, obovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a valued species in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
