                    <h1>Sparattanthelium sprucei</h1>
<p>Sparattanthelium sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's Sparattanthelium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind, a common strategy in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils and access limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Sparattanthelium sprucei is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
