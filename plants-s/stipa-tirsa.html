                    <h1>Stipa tirsa</h1>
<p>Stipa tirsa, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly Tibet and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristle-like flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa tirsa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species in its native environment.</p>
