<p>Salix purpurea var. eburnea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. It is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>The bark of this variety is smooth and pale, sometimes with a slight reddish tinge, giving it its common name.</p>
