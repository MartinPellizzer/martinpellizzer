<p>Sorghum serratum var. majus, commonly known as the giant serrated sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves and sturdy, branched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its height and hardiness, it is often used as a ornamental plant or for erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
