<p>Salacia cognata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Salacia cognata is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
