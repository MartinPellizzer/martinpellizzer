<p>Scirpus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its small, clustered inflorescences that produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus microcephalus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and aiding in water filtration.</p>
