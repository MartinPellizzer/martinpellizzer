                    <h1>Sonneratia iriomotensis</h1>
<p>Sonneratia iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote mangrove, is a rare mangrove species native to the island of Iriomote in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in brackish water environments, adapting to the fluctuating salinity levels of coastal areas. The plant has specialized roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in mangrove ecosystems. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental change.</p>
