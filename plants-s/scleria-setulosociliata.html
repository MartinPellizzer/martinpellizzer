<p>Scleria setulosociliata, commonly known as the woolly bulbous sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Scleria setulosociliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats.</p>
