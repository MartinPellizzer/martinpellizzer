                    <h1>Senegalia hirsuta</h1>
<p>Senegalia hirsuta, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, often spiral-shaped branches and small, deciduous leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Senegalia hirsuta also has historical significance as a food source for both wildlife and humans.</p>
