                    <h1>Salix desertorum var. elata</h1>
<p>Salix desertorum var. elata, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in catkin-like clusters. The leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to low water availability and can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
