                    <h1>Stapelia lentiginosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia lentiginosa, commonly known as the Chocolate Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom in the evening and remain open for only a few days.</p>
<p>Stapelia lentiginosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
