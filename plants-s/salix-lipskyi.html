<p>Salix lipskyi, commonly known as the Lisko willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Its flexible branches and drought tolerance make it suitable for reclamation of degraded soils.</p>
<p>Salix lipskyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife.</p>
