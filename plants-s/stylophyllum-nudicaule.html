                    <h1>Stylophyllum nudicaule</h1>
<p>Stylophyllum nudicaule, commonly known as the slender sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in shallow tropical waters.</p>
<p>It has a delicate, branching structure with long, thin polyps that extend from its main axis. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its polyps for photosynthesis, as they contain symbiotic algae. It thrives in clear, warm waters and is often found in coral reefs.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an important part of marine ecosystems.</p>
