<p>Sedum fragile, commonly known as the brittle stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate stems, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to prevent damage from wind or animals.</p>
