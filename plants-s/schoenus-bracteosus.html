<p>Schoenus bracteosus, commonly known as the bracteated bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in moist soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
