<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale lavender petals that resemble moonlight, hence its common name. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often near waterfalls or in crevices of rocky terrain. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The flower blooms only during the twilight hours, adding to its enigmatic and ethereal appeal.</p>
