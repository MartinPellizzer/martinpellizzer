                    <h1>Saxifraga umbrosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a reddish tinge, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and slightly toothed, arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga umbrosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, shaded garden settings.</p>
