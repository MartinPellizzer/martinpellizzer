<p>Saponaria viscosa, commonly known as sticky soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which produce a sticky substance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Saponaria viscosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural soap due to its saponin content.</p>
