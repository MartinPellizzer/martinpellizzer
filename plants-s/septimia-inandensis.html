<p>Septimia inandensis, commonly known as the Andean skyflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet petals and small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Septimia inandensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
