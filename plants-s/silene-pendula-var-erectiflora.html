                    <h1>Silene pendula var. erectiflora</h1>
<p>Silene pendula var. erectiflora, commonly known as the upright-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are slender and branching.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical Silene pendula by its upright flowering stems rather than the drooping ones of the common form.</p>
