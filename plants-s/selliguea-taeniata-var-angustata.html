                    <h1>Selliguea taeniata var. angustata</h1>
<p>Selliguea taeniata var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form, angustata, is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Selliguea taeniata.</p>
