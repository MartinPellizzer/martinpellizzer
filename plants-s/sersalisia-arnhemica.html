                <h1>Sersalisia arnhemica</h1>
<p>Sersalisia arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem sandstone lichen, is a unique lichen species found in the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, sandy soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
