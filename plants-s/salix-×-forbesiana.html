<p>Salix × forbesiana, commonly known as the Weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in spring and summer, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
