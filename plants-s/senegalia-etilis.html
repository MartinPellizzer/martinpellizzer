                    <h1>Senegalia etilis</h1>
<p>Senegalia etilis, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia etilis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
