                    <h1>Salix lutea var. desolata</h1>
<p>Salix lutea var. desolata, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its striking yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably drought-tolerant and can survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
