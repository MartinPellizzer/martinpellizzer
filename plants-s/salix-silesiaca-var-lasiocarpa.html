                    <h1>Salix silesiaca var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix silesiaca var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the Silesian willow or woolly willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its distinctive, woolly-appearing leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a pale underside, contributing to its unique appearance. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands.</p>
