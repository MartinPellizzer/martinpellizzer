                    <h1>Santalum margaretae</h1>
<p>Santalum margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its fragrant heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
