                    <h1>Silene odontopetala var. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Silene odontopetala var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the glabrous toothed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrifolia has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
