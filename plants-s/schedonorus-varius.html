                    <h1>Schedonorus varius</h1>
<p>Schedonorus varius, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, carpet-like growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental turf. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color and have a slightly waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Schedonorus varius is also noted for its ability to form a dense sod, which makes it resistant to foot traffic and wear.</p>
