                    <h1>Stichorkis asinacephala</h1>
<p>Stichorkis asinacephala, commonly known as the horse's head lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped thallus that often resembles a horse's head, hence its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in rocky, humid environments, often found on tree trunks or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in both ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
