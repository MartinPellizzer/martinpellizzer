<p>Sedum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna sedum, is a succulent plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Sedum aetnense is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
