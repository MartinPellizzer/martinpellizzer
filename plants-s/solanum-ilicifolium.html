                    <h1>Solanum ilicifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum ilicifolium, commonly known as the hollyleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, holly-like leaves with spiny margins and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a dark purple, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes.</p>
