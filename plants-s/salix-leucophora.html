<p>Salix leucophora, commonly known as the white-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers that develop into samaras, or winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix leucophora is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
