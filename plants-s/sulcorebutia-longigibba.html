<p>Sulcorebutia longigibba, commonly known as the long-stemmed crassula, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
