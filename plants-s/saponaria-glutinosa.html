<p>Saponaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pink or purple flowers.

Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, sticky hairs.</p>
<p>Saponaria glutinosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
