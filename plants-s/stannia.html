                    <h1>Stannia</h1>
<p>Stannia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect intense sunlight and retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapting to its harsh habitat. Stannia has a deep root system that allows it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
