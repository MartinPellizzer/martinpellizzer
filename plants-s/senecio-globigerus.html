<p>Senecio globigerus, commonly known as the globigerous groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent perennial that forms dense, low-growing mats with thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Senecio globigerus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
