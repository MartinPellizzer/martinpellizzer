<p>Salsola chellalensis, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in harsh, dry environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. Its succulent leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and its deep root system allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Salsola chellalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
