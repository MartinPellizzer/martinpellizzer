                    <h1>Sorghum bicorne</h1>
<p>Sorghum bicorne, commonly known as kafir corn, is a tall, drought-resistant grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It produces tall stalks with large, triangular leaves and panicles of small, hard, black seeds. The plant is highly adaptable to poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a staple crop in arid regions. Its seeds are used for food, animal feed, and brewing, while the stalks are used for construction and thatching.</p>
<p>Sorghum bicorne plays a vital role in both agriculture and traditional practices across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
