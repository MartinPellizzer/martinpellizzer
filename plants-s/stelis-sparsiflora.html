<p>Stelis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white root hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a loose cluster, and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Stelis sparsiflora is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
