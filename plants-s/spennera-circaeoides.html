                    <h1>Spennera circaeoides</h1>
<p>Spennera circaeoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
