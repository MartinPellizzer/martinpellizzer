                    <h1>Salix tomophylla</h1>
<p>Salix tomophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix tomophylla is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
