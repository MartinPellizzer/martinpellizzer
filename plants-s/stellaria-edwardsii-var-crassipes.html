<p>Stellaria edwardsii var. crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland margins, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It has a creeping rootstock that helps it spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is of conservation interest due to its restricted distribution and preference for specific habitat conditions.</p>
