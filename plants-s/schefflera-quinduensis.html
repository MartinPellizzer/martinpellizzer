                    <h1>Schefflera quinduensis</h1>
<p>Schefflera quinduensis, commonly known as the Quindu schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Schefflera quinduensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections, though it is less commonly cultivated than other schefflera species.</p>
