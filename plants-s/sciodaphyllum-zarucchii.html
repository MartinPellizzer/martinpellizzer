                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum zarucchii</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum zarucchii, commonly known as the cloud forest pine, is a rare and unique conifer native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a conical shape that allows it to withstand strong winds and heavy rainfall. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a key component of the understory in its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Sciodaphyllum zarucchii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
