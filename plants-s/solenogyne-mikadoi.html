<p>Solenogyne mikadoi, commonly known as the Mikado's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a pale, almost ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Solenogyne mikadoi is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
