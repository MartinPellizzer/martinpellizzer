                    <h1>Sagina rodriguezii</h1>
<p>Sagina rodriguezii, commonly known as the Rodriguez's saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tiny, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sagina rodriguezii is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
