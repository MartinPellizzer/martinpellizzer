                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum venezuelense</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum venezuelense, commonly known as the Venezuelan shade fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and in dense forest understories, where it forms a dense, low-growing mat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Sciodaphyllum venezuelense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
