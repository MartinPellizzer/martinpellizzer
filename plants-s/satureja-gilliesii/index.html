                            <h1>Satureja Gilliesii</h1>
<p>Satureja gilliesii, commonly known as mountain savory, is a hardy perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This aromatic plant is prized for its fragrant leaves and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Despite its resilience, Satureja gilliesii remains a relatively underappreciated plant in the broader botanical world.</p>
