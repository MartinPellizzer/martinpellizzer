                    <h1>Setaria italica var. praecox</h1>
<p>Setaria italica var. praecox, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a small-grained cereal grass native to the warmer regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of long, bristly inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for arid climates. Its seeds are harvested when the grains are dry and mature, typically in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant has been cultivated for thousands of years and is valued for its nutritional content and adaptability to various growing environments.</p>
