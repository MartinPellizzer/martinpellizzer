<p>Sedum jullianum, commonly known as the Julian sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact appearance and ability to bloom reliably in full sun.</p>
