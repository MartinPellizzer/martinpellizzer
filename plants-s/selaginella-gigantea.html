                    <h1>Selaginella gigantea</h1>
<p>Selaginella gigantea, commonly known as the giant spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. The plant has a creeping, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it an important component of understory plant communities.</p>
