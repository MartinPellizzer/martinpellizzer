<p>Semele maderensis subsp.</p>
<p>portumonizensis, commonly known as the Madeiran sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Azores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and soil conditions.</p>
