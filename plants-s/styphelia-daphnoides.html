                    <h1>Styphelia daphnoides</h1>
<p>Styphelia daphnoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, sandy habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>Styphelia daphnoides is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
