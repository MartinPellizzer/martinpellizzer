<p>It is a low-growing annual or perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Salsola hispidula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in desert ecosystems.</p>
