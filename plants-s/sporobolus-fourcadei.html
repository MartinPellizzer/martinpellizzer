                    <h1>Sporobolus fourcadei</h1>
<p>Sporobolus fourcadei, commonly known as Fourcade's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant produces spikelets that are slender and compressed, with small, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures are adapted to disperse seeds through wind, a common strategy in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sporobolus fourcadei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
