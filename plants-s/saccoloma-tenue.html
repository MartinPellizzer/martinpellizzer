                    <h1>Saccoloma tenue</h1>
<p>Saccoloma tenue, commonly known as the slender saccoloma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Saccoloma tenue is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, forested areas.</p>
