                    <h1>Sphyrarhynchus amaniense</h1>
<p>Sphyrarhynchus amaniense, commonly known as the Amani thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude grasslands of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cooler, drier conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ecological role, it is an important component of the local grassland ecosystems.</p>
