<p>Spatalla ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Spatalla ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>
