                    <h1>Selaginella longissima</h1>
<p>Selaginella longissima, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant features elongated, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations.</p>
<p>Selaginella longissima is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its unique adaptations.</p>
