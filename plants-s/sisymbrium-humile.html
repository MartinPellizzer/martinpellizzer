                    <h1>Sisymbrium humile</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium humile, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions such as Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are alternate and linear.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge in agricultural settings where it competes with crops.</p>
