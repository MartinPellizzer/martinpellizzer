                    <h1>Sagittaria fasciculata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria fasciculata, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomes spread horizontally through the substrate, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Sagittaria fasciculata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
