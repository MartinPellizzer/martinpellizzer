                    <h1>Sporobolus harmandii</h1>
<p>Sporobolus harmandii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sporobolus harmandii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
