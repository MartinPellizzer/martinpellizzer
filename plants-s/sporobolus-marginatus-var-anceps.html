                    <h1>Sporobolus marginatus var. anceps</h1>
<p>Sporobolus marginatus var. anceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf sanddrop, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, pale green leaves that often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in stabilizing sandy soils. Its rhizomatous root system helps it survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
