<p>Statice secundiramea, commonly known as the desert statice, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Statice secundiramea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
