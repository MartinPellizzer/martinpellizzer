<p>Stipa globosa, commonly known as the globular grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a hardy, low-maintenance ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Stipa globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
