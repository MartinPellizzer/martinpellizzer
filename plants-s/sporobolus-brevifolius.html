                    <h1>Sporobolus brevifolius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus brevifolius plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
