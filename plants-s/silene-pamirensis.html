<p>Silene pamirensis, commonly known as the Pamir catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Silene pamirensis has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
