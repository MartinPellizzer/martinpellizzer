                    <h1>Sieglingia purpurea</h1>
<p>Sieglingia purpurea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Sieglingia purpurea is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
