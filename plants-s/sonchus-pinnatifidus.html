                    <h1>Sonchus pinnatifidus</h1>
<p>Sonchus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (broadly notched) leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
