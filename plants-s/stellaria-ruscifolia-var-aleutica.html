<p>Stellaria ruscifolia var. aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or tundra-like environments.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
