                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris subvar. viridis</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris subvar. viridis, commonly known as the green clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a thick cuticle and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This subvariety is often found in rocky crevices and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
