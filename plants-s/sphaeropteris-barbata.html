<p>Sphaeropteris barbata, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Sphaeropteris barbata is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
