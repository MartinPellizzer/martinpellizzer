<p>Saxifraga × rosinae, commonly known as the Rosina saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
