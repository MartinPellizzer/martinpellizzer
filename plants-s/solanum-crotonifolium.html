                    <h1>Solanum crotonifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum crotonifolium, commonly known as the croton-leaved nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves that resemble those of the croton plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
