                    <h1>Stenogyne sessilis var. lanaiensis</h1>
<p>Stenogyne sessilis var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai ironwood, is a rare Hawaiian shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is native to the island of Lanai and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within mesic forests. Its woody structure and slow growth rate make it a valuable component of Hawaii's unique ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
