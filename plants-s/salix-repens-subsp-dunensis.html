<p>Salix repens subsp.</p>
<p>dunensis, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its flexible, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
