                            <h1>Scirpus Congruus</h1>
<p>Scirpus congruus is a common wetland plant known for its tall, stiff stems and clustered leaves. It thrives in moist to submerged soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important indicator of wetland health. Despite its widespread presence, Scirpus congruus remains underappreciated for its ecological contributions.</p>
