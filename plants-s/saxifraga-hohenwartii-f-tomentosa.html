                    <h1>Saxifraga hohenwartii f. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hohenwartii f. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, hairy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
