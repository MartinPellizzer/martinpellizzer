                    <h1>Sisymbrium lagascae var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium lagascae var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and lack of leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of grasses or shrubs. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
