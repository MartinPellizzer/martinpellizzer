<p>Salix × sabulicola, commonly known as the sand willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish bark that exfoliates to reveal a reddish-brown inner layer. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Salix × sabulicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
