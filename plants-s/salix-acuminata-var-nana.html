                    <h1>Salix acuminata var. nana</h1>
<p>Salix acuminata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact form, with short, flexible stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental plant.</p>
