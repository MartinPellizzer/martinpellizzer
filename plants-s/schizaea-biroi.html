                    <h1>Schizaea biroi</h1>
<p>Schizaea biroi, commonly known as the forked hepatic, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizoids. The plant produces small, capsule-like sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Schizaea biroi typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple yet distinctive morphology makes it a notable example of non-vascular plant adaptation.</p>
