<p>Stipellula, commonly known as the "spear-leaved" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that often resemble tiny spears, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a feature common in many members of the carrot family. Stipellula species are native to various regions in Asia and are often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>These plants are primarily of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
