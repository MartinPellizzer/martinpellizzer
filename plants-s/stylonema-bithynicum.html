<p>Stylonema bithynicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Stylonema bithynicum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality.</p>
