                    <h1>Spirillus interruptus</h1>
<p>Spirillus interruptus, commonly known as the spiral spirillum, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its coiled, spiral-shaped stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's structure allows it to float or anchor itself to substrates, facilitating its spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are often small and scale-like, reducing water resistance while maximizing light absorption.</p>
<p>Spirillus interruptus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
