                    <h1>Symphyandra finitima</h1>
<p>Symphyandra finitima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly dependent on specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its low reproductive rate, Symphyandra finitima is considered critically endangered.</p>
