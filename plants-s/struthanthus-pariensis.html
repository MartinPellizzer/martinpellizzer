<p>Struthanthus pariensis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Struthanthus pariensis is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
