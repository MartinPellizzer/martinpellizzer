                    <h1>Stigmaphyllon cavernulosum</h1>
<p>Stigmaphyllon cavernulosum, commonly known as the cave stigmaphyllon, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often clustered leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are often found in shaded, humid environments. It thrives in rocky or cave-like habitats, where it forms dense mats on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
