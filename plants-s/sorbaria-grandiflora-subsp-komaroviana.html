<p>Sorbaria grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>komaroviana, commonly known as the Komarov's sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and autumn foliage, which turns a striking yellow or orange.</p>
