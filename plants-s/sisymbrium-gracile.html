                    <h1>Sisymbrium gracile</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium gracile, commonly known as slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called phyllodes. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium gracile is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
