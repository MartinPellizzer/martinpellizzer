                    <h1>Sassafridium</h1>
<p>Sassafridium, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, often with one being broader than the others. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elliptical, red berries. Sassafridium is known for its aromatic roots, which have been historically used in flavoring and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Aronia aronia*, reflects its role in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
