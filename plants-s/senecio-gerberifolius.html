<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, with small, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
