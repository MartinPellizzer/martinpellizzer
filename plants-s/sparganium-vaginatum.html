<p>Sparganium vaginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of spadices, which are initially green and later turn reddish-brown. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that develop into spiny, berry-like structures.</p>
<p>Sparganium vaginatum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
