                    <h1>Salix glauca f. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Salix glauca f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved willow, is a variant of the white willow, characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. The leaves are typically longer and broader than those of the typical Salix glauca, with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance for pollinators.</p>
