                    <h1>Stapelia arnotii</h1>
<p>Stapelia arnotii, commonly known as the "Corpse Flower of the Cape," is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are often described as resembling decaying flesh, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection.</p>
<p>Stapelia arnotii is prized in horticulture for its unusual appearance and ability to bloom reliably under proper care.</p>
