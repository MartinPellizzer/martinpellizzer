<p>Salvia deserta, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats.</p>
<p>Salvia deserta is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
