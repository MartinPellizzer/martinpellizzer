<p>Sorbus scopulina var. cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade mountain ash, is a rare and specialized variant of the mountain ash species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive red berries that appear in the fall. This plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to cold, harsh climates, including a short growing season and frost resistance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
