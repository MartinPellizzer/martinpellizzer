                            <h1>Schelhammeria Capitata</h1>
<p>Schelhammeria capitata is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is known for its striking, cone-shaped inflorescence that resembles a small helmet, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its delicate flowers come in shades of white and pink, adding a touch of elegance to its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, Schelhammeria capitata remains relatively obscure and is rarely cultivated outside its native range.</p>
