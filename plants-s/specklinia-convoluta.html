<p>Specklinia convoluta, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and produce small, clustered roots that help it anchor to its host.</p>
<p>Specklinia convoluta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
