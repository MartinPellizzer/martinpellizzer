<p>Senecio sumarae, commonly known as the Namib Desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that has adapted to the arid environment with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Senecio sumarae plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
