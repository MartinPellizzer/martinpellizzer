<p>Sphenostigma geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, undulating thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant's body is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. Its morphology includes a leathery, lobed appearance with a yellowish to greenish hue.</p>
<p>Sphenostigma geniculatum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
