                    <h1>Stapelia × discolor var. tricolor</h1>
<p>Stapelia × discolor var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color African milkweed, is a hybrid succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, three-toned flowers that range from yellow to orange and red, resembling the color of blood, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation.</p>
