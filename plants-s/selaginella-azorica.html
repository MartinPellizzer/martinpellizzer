<p>Selaginella azorica, commonly known as the Azorean spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the Azores.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spiky leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant is adapted to humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. It has a unique ability to survive desiccation, which allows it to thrive in its rocky, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
