<p>Sternbergia lutea, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are often mistaken for true crocuses. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers consist of three sepals that resemble petals and three true petals, with a distinctive, curved shape.</p>
<p>Sternbergia lutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade.</p>
