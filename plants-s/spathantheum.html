                    <h1>Spathantheum</h1>
<p>Spathantheum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is a subject of both botanical fascination and conservation concern.</p>
