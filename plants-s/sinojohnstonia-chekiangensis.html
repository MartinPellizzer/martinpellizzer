                    <h1>Sinojohnstonia chekiangensis</h1>
<p>Sinojohnstonia chekiangensis, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and role in understanding plant adaptation in subtropical climates.</p>
