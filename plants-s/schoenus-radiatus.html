                    <h1>Schoenus radiatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus radiatus, commonly known as the radiate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, clustered flower heads during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Schoenus radiatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
