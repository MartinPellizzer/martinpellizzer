<p>Scleria amphigaea, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct arrowhead shape.</p>
<p>Scleria amphigaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
