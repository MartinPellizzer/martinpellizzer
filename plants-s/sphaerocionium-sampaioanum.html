<p>Sphaerocionium sampaioanum, commonly known as the Sampaio's orbiculate, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy fruits that resemble small, rounded oranges, which are a key feature in its botanical description. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with pinkish-white petals, and it produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
