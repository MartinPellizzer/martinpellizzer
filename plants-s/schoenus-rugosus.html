<p>Schoenus rugosus, commonly known as the rough sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Schoenus rugosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
