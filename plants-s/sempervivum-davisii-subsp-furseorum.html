<p>Sempervivum davisii subsp.</p>
<p>furseorum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and surrounding mountain ranges. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can tolerate harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
