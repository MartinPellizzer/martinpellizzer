<p>Senecio multilobatus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Senecio multilobatus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
