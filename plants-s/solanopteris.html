                    <h1>Solanopteris</h1>
<p>Solanopteris, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Solanopteris species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in their reproductive biology.</p>
