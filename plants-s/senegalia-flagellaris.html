                    <h1>Senegalia flagellaris</h1>
<p>Senegalia flagellaris, commonly known as the desert shrub or flagellate acacia, is a drought-tolerant plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to harsh environments make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
