                    <h1>Salix arctica var. subpolaris</h1>
<p>Salix arctica var. subpolaris, commonly known as the polar willow, is a low-growing shrub adapted to extreme Arctic and subarctic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and coastal regions. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dark berries that serve as a food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in harsh polar ecosystems.</p>
