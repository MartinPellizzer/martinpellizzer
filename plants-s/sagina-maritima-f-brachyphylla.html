                    <h1>Sagina maritima f. brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Sagina maritima f. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its small, rounded leaves are closely packed, reducing water loss and enhancing stability in wind-blown habitats. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is a valuable component of coastal ecosystems, supporting biodiversity in salt-tolerant habitats.</p>
