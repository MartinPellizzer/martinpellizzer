<p>Schismatoglottis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it is characterized by its large, leathery, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of yellow and red, often with a distinctive violet or purple tint. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
