                    <h1>Salix boothii</h1>
<p>Salix boothii, commonly known as the Booth's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are typical of willow species, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Salix boothii is often found in rocky or sandy soils along streams or in open woodlands.</p>
