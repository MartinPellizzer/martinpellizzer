<p>Sequoia gigantea var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping giant sequoia, is a striking variant of the giant sequoia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk, creating a unique and dramatic appearance. This variety is a naturally occurring form, though it is less common than the upright giant sequoia. The leaves are small, scale-like, and densely packed, typical of the species.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight to flourish.</p>
