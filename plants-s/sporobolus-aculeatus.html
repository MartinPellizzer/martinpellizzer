<p>Sporobolus aculeatus, commonly known as prickly sacaton, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and sharp, spiny leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus aculeatus plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
