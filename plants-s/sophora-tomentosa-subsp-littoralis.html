<p>Sophora tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pod and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
