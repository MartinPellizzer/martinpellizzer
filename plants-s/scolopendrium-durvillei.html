<p>Scolopendrium durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores. The plant features scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, typical of the family Lycopodiaceae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
