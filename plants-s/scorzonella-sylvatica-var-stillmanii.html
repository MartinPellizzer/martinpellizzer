                    <h1>Scorzonella sylvatica var. stillmanii</h1>
<p>Scorzonella sylvatica var. stillmanii, commonly known as Stillman's scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, which contributes to its ecological resilience.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
