                    <h1>Sarcopera aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Sarcopera aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Sarcopera aurantiaca is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
