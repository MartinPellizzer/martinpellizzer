                    <h1>Santalum insulare var. raivavense</h1>
<p>Santalum insulare var. raivavense, commonly known as the Raivavae sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Raivavae in the French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to the humid, tropical climate. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in perfumes and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
