                            <h1>Spergula Arvensis Var. Pentandra</h1>
<p>Spergula arvensis var. pentandra is a lesser-known member of the carnation family known for its delicate, grass-like appearance. Found primarily in moist soils across Europe and parts of Asia, this variant thrives in disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its small, pale blue or white flowers bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to the landscape. Though not widely cultivated, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations. This plant offers a unique glimpse into the diversity of flowering plants often overlooked in everyday nature.</p>
