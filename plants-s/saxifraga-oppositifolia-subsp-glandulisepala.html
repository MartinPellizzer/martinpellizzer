<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp.</p>
<p>glandulisepala, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to white flowers during the short growing season. Its flowers are often borne on short stalks and are adapted to attract pollinators such as flies and bees.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by the presence of glandular structures on its sepals, distinguishing it from other members of the species.</p>
