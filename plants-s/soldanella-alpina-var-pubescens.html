                    <h1>Soldanella alpina var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Soldanella alpina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent alpine soldanella, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has hairy, pubescent foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Soldanella alpina.</p>
