                    <h1>Salvia gundelia</h1>
<p>Salvia gundelia, commonly known as the Armenian sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet-blue flower spikes in the summer, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
