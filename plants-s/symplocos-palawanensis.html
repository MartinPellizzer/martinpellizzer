<p>Symplocos palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan evergreen or Palawan symplocos, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or orange when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
