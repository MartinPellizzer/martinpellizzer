                    <h1>Salix mielichhoferi</h1>
<p>Salix mielichhoferi, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
