                    <h1>Silene nocturna var. permixta</h1>
<p>Silene nocturna var. permixta, commonly known as the evening silene, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, which is believed to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique hybrid nature, as the 'permixta' variety results from natural cross-pollination between different Silene species.</p>
