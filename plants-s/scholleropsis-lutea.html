                    <h1>Scholleropsis lutea</h1>
<p>Scholleropsis lutea, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Scholleropsis lutea plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
