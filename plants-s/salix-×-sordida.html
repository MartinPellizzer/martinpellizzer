<p>Salix × sordida, commonly known as the black willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are catkins, which are usually male and female, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The black willow is also notable for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
