                    <h1>Sorbus eburnea</h1>
<p>Sorbus eburnea, commonly known as the white-ash sorbus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that resembles ivory, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with finely serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Sorbus eburnea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils.</p>
