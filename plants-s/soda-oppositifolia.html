                    <h1>Soda oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Soda oppositifolia, commonly known as the saltwort, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often succulent to store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its stems are usually prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across salt-affected soils.</p>
<p>Soda oppositifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal and arid ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
