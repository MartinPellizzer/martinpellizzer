<p>Sorbus glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Sorbus glomerulata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks.</p>
