                    <h1>Selaginella albonitens f. typica</h1>
<p>Selaginella albonitens f. typica, commonly known as the white-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
