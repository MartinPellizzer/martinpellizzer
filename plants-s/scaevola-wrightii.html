                    <h1>Scaevola wrightii</h1>
<p>Scaevola wrightii, commonly known as Wright's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with compact, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Scaevola wrightii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its minimal water requirements.</p>
