<p>Staurochilus ramosus, commonly known as the branched star-moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizoids help anchor it to surfaces, and it reproduces via spores released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Staurochilus ramosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
