                    <h1>Stenospermation pteropus</h1>
<p>Stenospermation pteropus, commonly known as the narrow-seed fern, is a fossil plant that lived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branched stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant's reproductive structures suggest it was a primitive seed plant, possibly related to the ancestors of modern gymnosperms. Its fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating it thrived in swampy, tropical environments.</p>
<p>The study of Stenospermation pteropus provides insights into early plant evolution and the development of seed plants.</p>
