<p>Stewartia acutisepala, commonly known as the sharp-sepaled stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, followed by cup-shaped, red-brown fruits. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
<p>Stewartia acutisepala is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions and its relatively slow growth rate.</p>
