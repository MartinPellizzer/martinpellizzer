                    <h1>Syngonanthus kegelianus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus kegelianus, commonly known as the Kegelian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval, and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
