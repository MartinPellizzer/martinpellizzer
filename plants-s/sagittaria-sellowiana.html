<p>Sagittaria sellowiana, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves floating on the surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
