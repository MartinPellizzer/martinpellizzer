<p>Scilla comata, commonly known as the woolly squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its dense, white, woolly coating on the leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Scilla comata is valued in gardens for its early spring blooms and ornamental appeal.</p>
