                    <h1>Selaginella latupana</h1>
<p>Selaginella latupana, commonly known as the common spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, spike-like clusters of leaves that are often bright green. Selaginella latupana is characterized by its ability to reproduce through spores rather than seeds, and it exhibits a unique form of photosynthesis known as CAM photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to conserve water efficiently, making it well-suited for its often arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
