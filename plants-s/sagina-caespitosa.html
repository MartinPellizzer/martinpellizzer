                    <h1>Sagina caespitosa</h1>
<p>Sagina caespitosa, commonly known as common carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors, stream banks, and garden beds. The plant has small, succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in clusters. It spreads primarily through stolons, which root at the nodes to form dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is often considered a weed in cultivated areas but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
