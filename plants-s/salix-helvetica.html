                    <h1>Salix helvetica</h1>
<p>Salix helvetica, commonly known as the European white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, and is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix helvetica is a valuable species for both ecological and historical uses.</p>
