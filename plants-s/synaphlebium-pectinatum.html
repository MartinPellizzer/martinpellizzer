<p>Synaphlebium pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinatum lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
