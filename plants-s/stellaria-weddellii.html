<p>Stellaria weddellii, commonly known as the Antarctic starwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing herbaceous plant that typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small white or pale blue flowers with five petals, arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Stellaria weddellii is adapted to survive in extreme climates, making it a resilient species in polar and high-altitude regions.</p>
