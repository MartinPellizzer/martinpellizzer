                    <h1>Spergularia atheniensis proles salinaria</h1>
<p>Spergularia atheniensis proles salinaria, commonly known as the salt marsh spurge, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other habitats with high salt content in the soil.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme salinity makes it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems.</p>
