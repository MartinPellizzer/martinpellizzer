                    <h1>Solanum convolvulus var. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Solanum convolvulus var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous nightshade, is a variant of the common morning glory.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological variation, which has led to its classification as a separate variety within the Solanum convolvulus species.</p>
