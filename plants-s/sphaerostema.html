                    <h1>Sphaerostema</h1>
<p>Sphaerostema, commonly known as the globe liverwort, is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, cushion-like growth form and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Sphaerostema species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on rocks or tree trunks. Their leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces spores in capsules that are often enclosed in a cup-like structure.</p>
<p>Sphaerostema plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
