                    <h1>Sobolewskia lithophila</h1>
<p>Sobolewskia lithophila, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a type of lichen, which is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically an alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, arid conditions, often growing on limestone or other mineral surfaces. Its structure is typically crust-like, allowing it to cling tightly to the substrate and minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Sobolewskia lithophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its specialized habitat.</p>
