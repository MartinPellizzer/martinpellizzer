<p>Sarcochilus harriganiae, commonly known as the Harrigan's sarcochilus, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It has a short flowering period, usually in late winter to early spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
