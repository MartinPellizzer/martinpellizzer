<p>Striga bilabiata subsp.</p>
<p>barteri, commonly known as the barter's witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Its life cycle is closely linked to specific host species, and it can significantly impact agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in some regions and a challenge for sustainable farming.</p>
