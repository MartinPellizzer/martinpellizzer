                    <h1>Spiranthes prasophylla var. cleistogama</h1>
<p>Spiranthes prasophylla var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous pink spire orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with flowers that are mostly closed (cleistogamous), which facilitates self-pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine rocklands and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of tightly spiraled, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its short, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
