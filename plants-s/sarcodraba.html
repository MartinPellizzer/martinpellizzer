<p>Sarcodraba, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Sarcodraba species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and the ability to store water in their bulbs.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Sarcodraba bicolor and Sarcodraba capensis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
