                            <h1>Salsola Acicularis</h1>
<p>Goatweed, scientifically known as Salsola acicularis, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It thrives in harsh environments, often found along roadsides, in deserts, and on disturbed soils due to its drought-resistant nature. The plant is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, greenish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. While it is considered a weed in some areas, it plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in the study of xerophytic plants.</p>
