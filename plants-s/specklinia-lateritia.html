<p>Specklinia lateritia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Specklinia lateritia is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
