<p>Stipa arida, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale to brownish florets. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Stipa arida plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
