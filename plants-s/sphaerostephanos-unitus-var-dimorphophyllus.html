                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos unitus var. dimorphophyllus</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos unitus var. dimorphophyllus, commonly known as the two-leaf star-fruit, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral morphology.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is notable for its dimorphic leaves, which exhibit two distinct forms on the same plant—lobed and simple—adding to its botanical intrigue. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same individual, a feature common in many cucurbit species.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is small and star-shaped, is edible and has a tangy flavor, making it a subject of both scientific interest and culinary curiosity.</p>
