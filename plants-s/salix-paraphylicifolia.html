                    <h1>Salix paraphylicifolia</h1>
<p>Salix paraphylicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its main means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
