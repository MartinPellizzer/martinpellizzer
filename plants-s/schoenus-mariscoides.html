                    <h1>Schoenus mariscoides</h1>
<p>Schoenus mariscoides, commonly known as the marsh grass or water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in poorly drained soils, thriving in humid and temperate climates. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in tufts, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus mariscoides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
