<p>Sempervivum speciosum, commonly known as the "Crown of the Andes," is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It is well adapted to rocky, high-altitude environments and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Sempervivum speciosum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
