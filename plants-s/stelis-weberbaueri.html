                    <h1>Stelis weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Stelis weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features a short, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
