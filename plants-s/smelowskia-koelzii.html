<p>Smelowskia koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's smelowskia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, Smelowskia koelzii is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
