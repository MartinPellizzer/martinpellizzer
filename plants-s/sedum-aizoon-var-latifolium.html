                    <h1>Sedum aizoon var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Sedum aizoon var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
