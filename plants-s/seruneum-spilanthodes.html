<p>Seruneum spilanthodes, commonly known as the blue spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
