<p>Sedum bonnieri, commonly known as the Bonnert's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum bonnieri is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
