<p>Schoenoplectus monophyllus subsp.</p>
<p>conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, leaf-like stems that form a thick mat on the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
