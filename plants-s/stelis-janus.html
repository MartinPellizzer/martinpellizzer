<p>Stelis janus, commonly known as the two-faced orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with clustered leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique floral morphology and growth habit make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Stelis janus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
