<p>Sphenanthera, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Sphenanthera species are characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers and succulent leaves that help them conserve water. The genus includes several species, such as Sphenanthera stricta and Sphenanthera glabra, which are adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
