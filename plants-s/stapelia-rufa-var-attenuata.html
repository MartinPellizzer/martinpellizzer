                    <h1>Stapelia rufa var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Stapelia rufa var. attenuata, commonly known as the Red-stemmed Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of red or orange flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
