                    <h1>Smilax verticalis</h1>
<p>Smilax verticalis, commonly known as the climbing smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and produces woody, thorny stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax verticalis is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a resilient and sometimes invasive plant in certain regions.</p>
