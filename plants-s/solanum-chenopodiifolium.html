                    <h1>Solanum chenopodiifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum chenopodiifolium, commonly known as desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Solanum chenopodiifolium is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
