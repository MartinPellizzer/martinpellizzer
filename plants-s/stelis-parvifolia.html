<p>Stelis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Stelis parvifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
