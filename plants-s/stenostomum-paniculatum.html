                    <h1>Stenostomum paniculatum</h1>
<p>Stenostomum paniculatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of trees and shrubs, drawing water and nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are usually clustered in panicles, which are branching inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, facilitating bird-mediated seed dispersal.</p>
