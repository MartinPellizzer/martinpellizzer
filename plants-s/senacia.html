<p>It produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to South Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Senacia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves store water, making it adaptable to arid environments.</p>
