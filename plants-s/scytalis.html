                    <h1>Scytalis</h1>
<p>Scytalis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on specialized structures called pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Scytalis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
