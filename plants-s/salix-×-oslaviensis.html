<p>Salix × oslaviensis, commonly known as the Oslewis willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra.</p>

The plant produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix × oslaviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
