<p>Sasamorpha borealis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the northern sasamorpha, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, showy purple to pink flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme cold and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to polar environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
