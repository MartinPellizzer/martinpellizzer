                    <h1>Sedum fusiforme</h1>
<p>Sedum fusiforme, commonly known as the spindle-shaped stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Sedum fusiforme is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to withstand harsh climates.</p>
