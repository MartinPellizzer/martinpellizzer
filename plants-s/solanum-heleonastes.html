<p>Solanum heleonastes, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and hairy, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum heleonastes is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
