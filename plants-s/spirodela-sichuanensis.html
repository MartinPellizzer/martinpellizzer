<p>Spirodela sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan spirodela, is a floating aquatic plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of buoyant, three-lobed fruits. Spirodela sichuanensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
