                    <h1>Scleria ciliata var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Scleria ciliata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-fruited bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Scleria ciliata var. glabrescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
