<p>Selaginella silvestris, commonly known as the climbing clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that forms dense mats or cushions on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporangia and megasporangia. Selaginella silvestris is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
