                    <h1>Scleranthus crinitus</h1>
<p>Scleranthus crinitus, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its adaptability in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
