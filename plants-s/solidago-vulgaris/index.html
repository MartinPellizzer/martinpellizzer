                            <h1>Solidago Vulgaris</h1>
<p>Solidago vulgaris, commonly known as the common goldenrod, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is recognized for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its ability to attract pollinators makes it an important species in ecosystems. Despite its showy appearance, it is often misunderstood and mistaken for an allergen.</p>
