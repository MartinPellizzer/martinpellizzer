<p>Sorghum bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>verticilliflorum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a lesser-known subspecies of sorghum native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sorghum varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences, which are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
