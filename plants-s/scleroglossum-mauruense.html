<p>Scleroglossum mauruense, commonly known as the African horned vulture, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scleroglossum mauruense is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal care once established.</p>
