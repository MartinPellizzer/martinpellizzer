                    <h1>Strychnos barbata</h1>
<p>Strychnos barbata, commonly known as the hairy strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with distinctive pubescent surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and roots.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for medicinal use despite its potential botanical interest.</p>
