                    <h1>Stomatium</h1>
<p>Stomatium, commonly known as the mouth-like structure in certain plants, is a specialized organ found in some aquatic and semi-aquatic plants.</p>
<p>It functions as a site for gas exchange, allowing the plant to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The stomatium is typically composed of specialized cells that regulate its opening and closing in response to environmental conditions. This structure is particularly important in plants that live in water, where gas exchange can be limited.</p>
<p>Its presence and function contribute to the plant's ability to thrive in its specific habitat.</p>
