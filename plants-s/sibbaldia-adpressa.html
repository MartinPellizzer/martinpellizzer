                    <h1>Sibbaldia adpressa</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia adpressa, commonly known as the flat sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves and produces white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to low light conditions.</p>
<p>Sibbaldia adpressa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora.</p>
