                    <h1>Stewartia calcicola</h1>
<p>Stewartia calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola stewartia, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental, cone-like fruits. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stewartia calcicola is considered a conservation concern.</p>
