                <h1>Sesamoides minor</h1>
<p>Sesamoides minor, commonly known as the lesser sesamoid, is a small, calcified bone found within the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle in the foot.</p>
<p>It is often referred to as a sesamoid bone due to its resemblance to the sesame seed in size and shape. This bone serves as a pulley for the tendon, helping to increase the force generated by the muscle during movement. It is located beneath the first metatarsal bone and is embedded within the plantar fascia.</p>
<p>Sesamoides minor plays a crucial role in weight-bearing and movement of the foot, particularly during activities like running and jumping.</p>
