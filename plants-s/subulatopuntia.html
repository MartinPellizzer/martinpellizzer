                    <h1>Subulatopuntia</h1>
<p>Subulatopuntia, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and are often short-lived.</p>
<p>Subulatopuntia species are generally low-maintenance, making them popular choices for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
