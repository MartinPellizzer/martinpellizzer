                    <h1>Sagittaria variabilis</h1>
<p>Sagittaria variabilis, commonly known as variable arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sagittaria variabilis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity.</p>
