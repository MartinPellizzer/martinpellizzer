<p>Sapindus mauritianus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and pinnate, and its showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The tree produces woody, spiny fruits that enclose a single seed, and the outer husk of the fruit is used to make natural soap due to its saponin content. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources.</p>
<p>The plant has cultural and traditional significance in various indigenous communities.</p>
