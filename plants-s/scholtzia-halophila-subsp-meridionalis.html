<p>Scholtzia halophila subsp.</p>
<p>meridionalis, commonly known as the southern saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
