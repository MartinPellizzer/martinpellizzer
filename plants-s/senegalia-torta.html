                <h1>Senegalia torta</h1>
<p>Senegalia torta, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senegalia torta is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
