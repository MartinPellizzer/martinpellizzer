                    <h1>Sagittaria altigena</h1>
<p>Sagittaria altigena, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or extend downward into the water, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sagittaria altigena is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
