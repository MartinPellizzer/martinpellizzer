                <h1>Sedum algidum</h1>
<p>Sedum algidum, commonly known as the alpine sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants.</p>
