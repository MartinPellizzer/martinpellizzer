<p>Stipa pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of bracts, which contain the minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Stipa pamirica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
