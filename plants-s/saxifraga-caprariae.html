<p>Saxifraga caprariae, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>Saxifraga caprariae is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in full sun and poor, well-drained soils.</p>
