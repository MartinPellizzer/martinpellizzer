<p>Stellaria fontinalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds, preferring cool, humid conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, with five petals that attract pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Stellaria fontinalis is often found in calcareous soils and is an indicator species for aquatic and riparian habitats.</p>
