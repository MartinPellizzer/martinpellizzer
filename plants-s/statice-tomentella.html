                    <h1>Statice tomentella</h1>
<p>Statice tomentella, commonly known as woolly glasswort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes and tidal marshes.</p>
<p>Statice tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
