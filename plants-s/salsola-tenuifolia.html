                    <h1>Salsola tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola tenuifolia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with small, spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and saline environments due to its succulent stems and deep root system. It produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread widely.</p>
<p>Salsola tenuifolia is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
