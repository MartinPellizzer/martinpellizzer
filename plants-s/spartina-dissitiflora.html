                    <h1>Spartina dissitiflora</h1>
<p>Spartina dissitiflora, commonly known as the coastal cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Spartina dissitiflora plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
