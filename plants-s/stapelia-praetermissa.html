                    <h1>Stapelia praetermissa</h1>
<p>Stapelia praetermissa, commonly known as the Desert Star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia praetermissa is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal care once established.</p>
