                    <h1>Serapias × euxina</h1>
<p>Serapias × euxina, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Serapias acaulis and Serapias parviflora.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Serapias × euxina is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
