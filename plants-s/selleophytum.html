                    <h1>Selleophytum</h1>
<p>Selleophytum, commonly known as the glassworts, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, where they thrive in high-salinity soils. Selleophytum species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help them retain water in arid conditions. They often produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
