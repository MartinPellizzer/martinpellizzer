<p>Stylidium diuroides subsp.</p>
<p>paucifoliatum, commonly known as the sparse-leaved sun-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, sun-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several small, fleshy leaves and a cluster of showy, spurred flowers. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
