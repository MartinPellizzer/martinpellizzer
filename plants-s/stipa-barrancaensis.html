<p>Stipa barrancaensis, commonly known as the Barranca needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Stipa barrancaensis is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment.</p>
