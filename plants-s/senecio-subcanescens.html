                    <h1>Senecio subcanescens</h1>
<p>Senecio subcanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
