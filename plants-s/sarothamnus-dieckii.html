<p>Sarothamnus dieckii, commonly known as the Desert Tanbark, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Sarothamnus dieckii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
