                    <h1>Sarcocolla minor</h1>
<p>Sarcocolla minor, commonly known as the lesser sarcocolla, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can survive prolonged periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcocolla minor is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
