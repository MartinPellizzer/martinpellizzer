                    <h1>Salix sensitiva</h1>
<p>Salix sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves fully develop. Salix sensitiva is adapted to moist, often swampy habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Its name reflects its sensitive nature, as it can be easily damaged by wind or touch.</p>
