                    <h1>Sulcorebutia albissima</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia albissima, commonly known as the White-Flowered Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, spiny body that stores water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia albissima is well-suited for rock gardens and xerophytic landscapes due to its low water requirements and unique aesthetic.</p>
