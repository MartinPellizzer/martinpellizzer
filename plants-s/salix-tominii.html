                    <h1>Salix tominii</h1>
<p>Salix tominii, commonly known as the Toom's willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Salix tominii is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in arid and rocky habitats.</p>
