                            <h1>Sambucus Ebulus Subsp. Africana</h1>
<p>Sambucus ebulus subsp. africana is a lesser-known member of the honeysuckle family found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. This plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers and dark, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Despite its potential medicinal uses, it remains under-researched and largely overlooked in modern botanical studies. The subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Its ecological importance and possible health benefits make it a subject of growing interest among botanists and herbalists.</p>
