<p>Smegmathamnium luteum, commonly known as the golden thorn, is a unique plant species characterized by its striking yellow flowers and spiny, woody stems.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant's leaves are typically small and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are clustered in dense inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Smegmathamnium luteum is also valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
