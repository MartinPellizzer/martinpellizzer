<p>Stevia ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral stevia, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in other stevia species. However, unlike the more widely cultivated stevia, it is less commonly used in commercial applications.</p>
<p>Stevia ephemera is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates.</p>
