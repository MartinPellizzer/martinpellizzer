                    <h1>Syngonanthus fenestratus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus fenestratus, commonly known as the fenestrated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features perforations or holes, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries, which are important for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Syngonanthus fenestratus is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forests where its host trees thrive.</p>
