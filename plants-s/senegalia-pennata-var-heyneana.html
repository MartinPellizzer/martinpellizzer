<p>Senegalia pennata var. heyneana, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and compound leaves that are typically feathery in appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
