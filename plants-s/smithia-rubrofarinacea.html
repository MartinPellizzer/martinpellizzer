<p>Smithia rubrofarinacea, commonly known as the red-stemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats.</p>
<p>Smithia rubrofarinacea is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
