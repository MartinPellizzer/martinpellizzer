<p>Stelis nexipous, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, slender stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
