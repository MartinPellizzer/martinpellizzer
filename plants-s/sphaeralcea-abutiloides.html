<p>Sphaeralcea abutiloides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea abutiloides is often found in sandy or rocky soils along riverbanks and in desert scrub habitats.</p>
