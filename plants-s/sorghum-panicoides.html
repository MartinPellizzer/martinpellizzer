                    <h1>Sorghum panicoides</h1>
<p>Sorghum panicoides, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable forage crop and soil stabilizer.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stalks and seeds are also used in traditional medicine and animal feed.</p>
