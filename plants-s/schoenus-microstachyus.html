                    <h1>Schoenus microstachyus</h1>
<p>Schoenus microstachyus, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dense mats, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
