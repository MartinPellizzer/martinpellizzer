<p>Setaria limensis, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Setaria limensis is often found in association with other wetland plants, playing a role in maintaining ecological balance in these habitats.</p>
