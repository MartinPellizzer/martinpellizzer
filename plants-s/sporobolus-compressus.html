<p>Sporobolus compressus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus compressus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
