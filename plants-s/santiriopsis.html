                    <h1>Santiriopsis</h1>
<p>Santiriopsis, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Himalayas, is a rare and highly revered plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom during the summer months, often in the early morning. The plant has a short, stout stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are not only visually stunning but also hold significant cultural and spiritual importance in local traditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and the threats posed by climate change, Santiriopsis is considered an endangered species.</p>
