                    <h1>Sedum grisebachii</h1>
<p>Sedum grisebachii, commonly known as the silver sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sedum grisebachii is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
