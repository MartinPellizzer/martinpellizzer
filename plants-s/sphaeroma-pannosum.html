                    <h1>Sphaeroma pannosum</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma pannosum, commonly known as the hairy spiny barnacle, is a marine bryozoan found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive calcareous exoskeleton that is covered in fine, hairy projections, which help in reducing water flow around the colony. The structure of the colony is branching and often forms dense clusters on submerged surfaces like rocks and shells. Its zooids are small and cylindrical, with a unique arrangement of feeding structures.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to reef biodiversity.</p>
