                    <h1>Saxifraga lamarum</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lamarum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the stem tips.</p>
<p>Saxifraga lamarum is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
