<p>Stryphnodendron guianense, commonly known as the Guianan ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high commercial demand, Stryphnodendron guianense is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
