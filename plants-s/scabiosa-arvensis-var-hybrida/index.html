<p>Field scabious, scientifically known as Scabiosa arvensis var. hybrida, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often thriving in sunny conditions. The plant is recognized for its clusters of small, pink or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fluffy seed heads provide food for birds and insects, making it an important species in ecological habitats. Despite its delicate appearance, field scabious is resilient and adaptable, contributing to the biodiversity of its environment.</p>
