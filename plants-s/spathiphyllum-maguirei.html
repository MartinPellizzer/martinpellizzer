<p>Spathiphyllum maguirei, commonly known as the maguire's peace lily, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves and its striking white spathaceous flower that resembles a peace sign. The plant is an evergreen and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few weeks before wilting and being replaced by new growth.</p>
