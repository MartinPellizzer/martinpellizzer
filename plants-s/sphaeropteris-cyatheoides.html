<p>Sphaeropteris cyatheoides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk composed of a dense mass of rhizomes and its fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged, pinnate fronds with a smooth, waxy surface. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Sphaeropteris cyatheoides plays an important ecological role in humid, tropical forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
