<p>Scirpus filiculmis, commonly known as the feather-tongue sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus filiculmis plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
