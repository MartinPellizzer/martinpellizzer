                    <h1>Selenipedium aucourdianum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium aucourdianum, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and its distinctive, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, water, and light. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Selenipedium aucourdianum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
