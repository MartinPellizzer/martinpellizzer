<p>Spiesia dioritica, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems contain milky sap, which can be toxic to animals and humans if ingested.</p>
<p>Spiesia dioritica thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
