                    <h1>Striga barteri</h1>
<p>Striga barteri, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant is native to Africa and is considered a significant weed in agricultural systems due to its ability to weaken and sometimes kill its host. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Striga barteri is a major challenge in sustainable farming, particularly in regions with limited resources.</p>
