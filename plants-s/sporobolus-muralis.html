                    <h1>Sporobolus muralis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus muralis, commonly known as the wall grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Sporobolus muralis is often found growing on rocky slopes, canyon walls, and other exposed sites where it plays a role in preventing erosion.</p>
