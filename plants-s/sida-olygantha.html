                    <h1>Sida olygantha</h1>
<p>Sida olygantha, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from summer to fall. Sida olygantha is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and a low-growing habit to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
