                    <h1>Saxifraga glabricaulis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and barren environments, where it forms dense cushions to protect itself from harsh weather conditions. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga glabricaulis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats and is an indicator species for cold climates.</p>
