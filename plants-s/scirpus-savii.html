<p>Scirpus savii, commonly known as the Italian bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Scirpus savii has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of wetland health and is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and erosion control.</p>
