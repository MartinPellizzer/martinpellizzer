<p>Sporobolus laxus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy species well adapted to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Sporobolus laxus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range.</p>
