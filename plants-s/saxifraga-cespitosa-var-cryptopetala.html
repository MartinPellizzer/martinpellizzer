<p>Saxifraga cespitosa var. cryptopetala, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
