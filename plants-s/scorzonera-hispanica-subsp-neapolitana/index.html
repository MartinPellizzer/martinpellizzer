                            <h1>Scorzonera Hispanica Subsp. Neapolitana</h1>
<p>Spanish scorzonera, scientifically known as Scorzonera hispanica subsp. neapolitana, is a rare and ancient plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its deep purple flowers and tuberous roots that have been historically valued for their culinary and medicinal uses. This subspecies thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions of Italy and Spain. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several countries. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
