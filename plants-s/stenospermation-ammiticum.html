                    <h1>Stenospermation ammiticum</h1>
<p>Stenospermation ammiticum, commonly known as the narrow-seed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique reproductive strategy, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake and seed germination. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a reduced number of floral parts, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
