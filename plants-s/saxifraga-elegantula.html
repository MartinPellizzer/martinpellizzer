<p>Saxifraga elegantula, commonly known as the snow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding delicate beauty to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga elegantula is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
