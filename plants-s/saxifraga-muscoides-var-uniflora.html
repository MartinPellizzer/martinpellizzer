<p>Saxifraga muscoides var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of prostrate, hairy stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
