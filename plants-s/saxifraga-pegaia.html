                    <h1>Saxifraga pegaia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pegaia, commonly known as the coastal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastlines of the British Isles and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, saline environments, often found on cliffs and sea cliffs where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss and protect it from desiccation. Its small, white flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga pegaia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
