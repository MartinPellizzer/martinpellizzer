<p>Synaedrys dealbata, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries, which contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Synaedrys dealbata is native to southern Australia and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
