                    <h1>Selaginella rzedowskii</h1>
<p>Selaginella rzedowskii, commonly known as the Rzedowski's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
