                    <h1>Scopolia composita</h1>
<p>Scopolia composita, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Scopolia composita is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the Latin "scopulus," meaning rock, referring to its preference for rocky or limestone soils.</p>
