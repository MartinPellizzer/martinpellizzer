                    <h1>Sergia</h1>
<p>Sergia, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly prized for its durability and unique grain patterns. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching ages of over a century. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, sergia is now critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws.</p>
