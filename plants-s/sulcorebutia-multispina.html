                    <h1>Sulcorebutia multispina</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia multispina, commonly known as the spiny moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, ribbed stem that stores water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the growing season. Its spiny appearance is due to the presence of small, sharp spines along the stem.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia multispina is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
