                    <h1>Schanginia altissima</h1>
<p>Schanginia altissima, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, showy orchid flowers in shades of white and purple. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across moist, nutrient-rich soils in swampy environments. Schanginia altissima thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade, often found near rivers and in flooded meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its natural range.</p>
