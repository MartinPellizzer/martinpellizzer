<p>[WRONG START] Salix ledeburiana f. ledeburiana, commonly known as the Ledebour's willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
