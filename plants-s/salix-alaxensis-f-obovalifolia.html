                    <h1>Salix alaxensis f. obovalifolia</h1>
<p>Salix alaxensis f. obovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Salix alaxensis species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. This shrub typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its botanical features include small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in the mountainous areas of western North America.</p>
