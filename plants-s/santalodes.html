                    <h1>Santalodes</h1>
<p>Santalodes, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Santalodes species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color.</p>
<p>The plant's unique growth habit and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
