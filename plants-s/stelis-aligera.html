<p>Stelis aligera, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive pattern. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis aligera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
