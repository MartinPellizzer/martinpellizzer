                <h1>Selliguea soridens</h1>
<p>Selliguea soridens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus.</p>
<p>Selliguea soridens is often found in temperate regions and is an important indicator species for certain types of ecosystems.</p>
