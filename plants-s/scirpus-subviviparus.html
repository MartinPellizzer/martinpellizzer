<p>Scirpus subviviparus, commonly known as the viviparous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces flowering spikes that are typically green to reddish in color, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Scirpus subviviparus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through vivipary, where young plants develop on the stems, makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
