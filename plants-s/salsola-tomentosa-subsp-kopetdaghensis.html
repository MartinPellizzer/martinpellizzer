<p>Salsola tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdagh goosefoot, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in saline soils and is adapted to thrive in extreme temperatures.</p>
