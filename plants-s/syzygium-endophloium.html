                    <h1>Syzygium endophloium</h1>
<p>Syzygium endophloium, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and carving industries. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a warm, humid climate with well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, Syzygium endophloium is now critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws.</p>
