                    <h1>Selliera</h1>
<p>Selliera, commonly known as the "sunset flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. They are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers that often display shades of red, orange, and yellow, resembling the colors of a sunset. Selliera species are typically evergreen shrubs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of their native habitats.</p>
