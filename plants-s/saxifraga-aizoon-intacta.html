                    <h1>Saxifraga aizoon intacta</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aizoon intacta, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
