<p>Selenipedium × macrochilum giganteum, commonly known as the giant spider-orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming dense rosettes around the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
