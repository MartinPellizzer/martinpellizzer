<p>Specklinia jordanensis, commonly known as the Jordanian speckled orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the rocky habitats of Jordan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, speckled green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
