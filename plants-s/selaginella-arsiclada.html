<p>Selaginella arsiclada, commonly known as the Appalachian clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is typically short-lived.</p>
<p>Selaginella arsiclada is valued for its ability to retain moisture and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats.</p>
