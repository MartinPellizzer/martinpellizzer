                    <h1>Stewartia rostrata var. brevicalyx</h1>
<p>Stewartia rostrata var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The tree produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest.</p>
