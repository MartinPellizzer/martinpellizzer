<p>Schinopsis balansae, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a species native to South America, particularly found in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate with 5 to 11 leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Schinopsis balansae is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
