<p>Staurogyne coriacea, commonly known as the hard-stemmed water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has thick, woody stems that are covered in a rough, leathery texture, which helps it withstand strong water currents. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Staurogyne coriacea is also known for its ability to provide habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
