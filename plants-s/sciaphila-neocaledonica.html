                    <h1>Sciaphila neocaledonica</h1>
<p>Sciaphila neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia shade plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its moist but nutrient-poor habitat. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
