                    <h1>Selaginella wightii</h1>
<p>Selaginella wightii, commonly known as the Indian spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, linear leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Selaginella wightii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy.</p>
<p>This adaptability makes it an important component of its native ecosystems in South and Southeast Asia.</p>
