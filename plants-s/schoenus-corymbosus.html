<p>Schoenus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in compact, spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Schoenus corymbosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
