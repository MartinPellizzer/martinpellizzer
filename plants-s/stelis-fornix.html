<p>Stelis fornix, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like shape over the lip.</p>
<p>Stelis fornix thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose substrate for optimal growth.</p>
