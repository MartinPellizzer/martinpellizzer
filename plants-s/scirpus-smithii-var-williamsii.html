<p>Scirpus smithii var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
