                    <h1>Scirpus caespitosus</h1>
<p>Scirpus caespitosus, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its dense, grass-like clusters of leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus caespitosus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
