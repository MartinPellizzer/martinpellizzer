<p>Stemodiacra suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal dune shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has a woody stem that is often branched and covered with a thick layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.

It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal environments.</p>
