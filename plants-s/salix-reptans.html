                    <h1>Salix reptans</h1>
<p>Salix reptans, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, arching stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green. It thrives in moist, wet habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in riparian ecosystems.</p>
