                    <h1>Senegalia stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Senegalia stenocarpa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its yellow, globular flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, spongy material. It is adapted to drought conditions and has deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Senegalia stenocarpa is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
