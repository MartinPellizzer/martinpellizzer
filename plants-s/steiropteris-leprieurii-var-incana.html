<p>Steiropteris leprieurii var. incana, commonly known as the white-veined tree fern, is a rare and distinctive species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique appearance with its pale, almost white veins running through the fronds, giving it a striking visual contrast. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in its native range.</p>
