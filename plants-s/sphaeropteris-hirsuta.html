                    <h1>Sphaeropteris hirsuta</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
