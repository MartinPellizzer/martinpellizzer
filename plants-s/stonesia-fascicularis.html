<p>Stonesia fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
