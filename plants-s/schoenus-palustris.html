                    <h1>Schoenus palustris</h1>
<p>Schoenus palustris, commonly known as swamp grass or marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
