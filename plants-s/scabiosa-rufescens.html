<p>Scabiosa rufescens, commonly known as the redstem scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Scabiosa rufescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and meadows.</p>
<p>Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
