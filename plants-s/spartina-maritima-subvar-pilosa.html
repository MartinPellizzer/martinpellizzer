                    <h1>Spartina maritima subvar. pilosa</h1>
<p>Spartina maritima subvar. pilosa, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish and saline environments, such as tidal marshes and estuaries, and has adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salt concentrations. The plant has long, cylindrical leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss and salt accumulation. Its rhizomes form dense, interconnected networks that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Spartina maritima subvar. pilosa plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
