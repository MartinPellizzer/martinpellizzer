<p>Sphacele radula, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood. Sphacele radula reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
