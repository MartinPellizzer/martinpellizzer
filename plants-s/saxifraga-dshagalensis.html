                    <h1>Saxifraga dshagalensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga dshagalensis, commonly known as the Dshagal Mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga dshagalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats.</p>
