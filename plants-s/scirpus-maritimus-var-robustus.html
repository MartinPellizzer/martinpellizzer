<p>Scirpus maritimus var. robustus, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in brackish or saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in muddy or sandy soils.</p>
