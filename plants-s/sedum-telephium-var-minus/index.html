                            <h1>Sedum Telephium Var. Minus</h1>
<p>Sedum telephium var. minus is a striking member of the Crassulaceae family known for its compact growth and vibrant foliage. Native to rocky and coastal regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are typically blue-green with a powdery coating, giving it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. Easy to care for, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. This variety offers a subtle yet elegant alternative to its more showy relatives, making it a favorite among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
