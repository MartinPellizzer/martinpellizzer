                    <h1>Senecio culcitium</h1>
<p>Senecio culcitium, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senecio culcitium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions.</p>
