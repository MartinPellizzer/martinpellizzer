<p>Silene italica var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra violet, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in high-elevation habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and adaptations to harsh mountain environments.</p>
