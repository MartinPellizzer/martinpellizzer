<p>Spilotantha caloptera, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, succulent shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Spilotantha caloptera is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thickened stems and roots.</p>
