<p>Spicanta hastata, commonly known as the spiny spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Spicanta hastata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
