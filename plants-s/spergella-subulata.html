<p>Spergella subulata, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of fine, waxy cells. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorocarps.</p>
<p>Spergella subulata is an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats.</p>
