                    <h1>Striga zanzibarensis</h1>
<p>Striga zanzibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Zanzibar and the surrounding islands. This plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and invasive potential, it is considered a weed of economic importance in certain regions.</p>
