                    <h1>Spergularia halophila var. marginata</h1>
<p>Spergularia halophila var. marginata, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it thrives in high-salt soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various small organisms.</p>
