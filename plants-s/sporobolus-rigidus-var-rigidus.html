                    <h1>Sporobolus rigidus var. rigidus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus rigidus var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, rigid stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils.</p>
