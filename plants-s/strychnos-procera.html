<p>Strychnos procera, commonly known as the African angel's trumpets, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine.</p>
<p>Strychnos procera is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties.</p>
