<p>Salix eriantha, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often found near streams and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
