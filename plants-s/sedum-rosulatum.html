<p>Sedum rosulatum, commonly known as the Rosulate Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
