<p>Scaevola sinuata, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Scaevola sinuata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
