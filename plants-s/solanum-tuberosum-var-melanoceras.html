                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. melanoceras</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. melanoceras, commonly known as the black nightshade potato, is a variant of the common potato with distinctive dark purple to black skin and flesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant produces tubers that are typically smaller than standard potatoes but have a rich, earthy flavor. It is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers.</p>
<p>However, it contains solanine, making it potentially toxic if not prepared properly.</p>
