<p>Spermaxyrum strictum, commonly known as the rigid spermax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Spermaxyrum strictum is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go through periods of dormancy during droughts.</p>
