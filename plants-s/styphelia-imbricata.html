                    <h1>Styphelia imbricata</h1>
<p>Styphelia imbricata, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of white or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, sandy or rocky habitat. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Styphelia imbricata is often found in heathlands and is a characteristic component of the coastal flora of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
