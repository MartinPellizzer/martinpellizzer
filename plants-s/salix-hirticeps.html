<p>Salix hirticeps, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix hirticeps is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
