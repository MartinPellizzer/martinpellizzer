<p>Serrafalcus squarrosus, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its succulent-like leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Serrafalcus squarrosus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
