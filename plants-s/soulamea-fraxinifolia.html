                    <h1>Soulamea fraxinifolia</h1>
<p>Soulamea fraxinifolia, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that resemble those of the ash tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
