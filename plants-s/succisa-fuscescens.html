<p>Succisa fuscescens, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, violet-blue petals that surround a central cone-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Succisa fuscescens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
