                    <h1>Salsola bottae var. farinulenta</h1>
<p>Salsola bottae var. farinulenta, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives the plant its scientific name "farinulenta," meaning "starch-like.".</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
