                    <h1>Selaginella borealis f. amurensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella borealis f. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen herb with needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its sporophylls. Native to the northern regions of East Asia, it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
