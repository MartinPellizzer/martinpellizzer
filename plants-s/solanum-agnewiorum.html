<p>Solanum agnewiorum, commonly known as the Agnew's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
