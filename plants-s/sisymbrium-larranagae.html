                    <h1>Sisymbrium larranagae</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium larranagae, commonly known as the Larranaga's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Chile.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species of the genus Brassica. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native habitat.</p>
