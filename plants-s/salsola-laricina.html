                    <h1>Salsola laricina</h1>
<p>Salsola laricina, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Eurasia and North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils and often found in disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Salsola laricina plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
