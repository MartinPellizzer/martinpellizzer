                    <h1>Sorghum striatum</h1>
<p>Sorghum striatum, commonly known as the streaked sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display alternating green and white stripes. The plant produces panicles of small, purplish flowers, which are typically borne on long, branching stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, Sorghum striatum is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural purposes.</p>
