                    <h1>Silphium perfoliatum f. hornemannii</h1>
<p>Silphium perfoliatum f. hornemannii, commonly known as the Hornemann's milkweed, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often perforated at the base, allowing the stems to pass through. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable botanical feature is the milky sap it exudes, which contains toxic compounds.</p>
<p>This variety is considered a relic of the prehistoric flora and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
