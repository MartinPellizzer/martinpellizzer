<p>Schoenus abbreviatus, commonly known as the dwarf flat-sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact cluster at the base. Its flowering structures are small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Schoenus abbreviatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
