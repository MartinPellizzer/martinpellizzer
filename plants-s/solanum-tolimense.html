<p>Solanum tolimense, commonly known as the Tolima nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect or semi-woody growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. Solanum tolimense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
