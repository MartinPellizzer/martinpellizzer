                    <h1>Schiedea hawaiiensis</h1>
<p>Schiedea hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cichorioideae and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Schiedea hawaiiensis thrives in the high-elevation, sunny areas of Haleakalā Crater, where it has adapted to the harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
