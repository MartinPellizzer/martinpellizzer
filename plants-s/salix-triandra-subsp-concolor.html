<p>Salix triandra subsp.</p>
<p>concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically without the prominent ridges found in other willow species.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
