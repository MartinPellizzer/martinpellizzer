<p>Scirpus ellychniarius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
