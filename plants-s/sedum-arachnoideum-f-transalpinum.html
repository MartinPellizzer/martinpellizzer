                    <h1>Sedum arachnoideum f. transalpinum</h1>
<p>Sedum arachnoideum f. transalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine snow sedum, is a succulent plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, adding a delicate floral touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
