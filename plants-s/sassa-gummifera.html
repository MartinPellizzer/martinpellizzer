                    <h1>Sassa gummifera</h1>
<p>Sassa gummifera, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, pungent roots and leaves that are alternate and often have three lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its roots have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains toxic compounds, and its use is now largely restricted due to legal and health concerns.</p>
