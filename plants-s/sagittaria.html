<p>Sagittaria, commonly known as arrowhead, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants found in wetlands, marshes, and shallow waters across the globe.</p>
<p>These plants typically have arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or grow submerged, depending on the species. Sagittaria species are characterized by their distinctive floral structures, which often consist of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Additionally, some species are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions.</p>
