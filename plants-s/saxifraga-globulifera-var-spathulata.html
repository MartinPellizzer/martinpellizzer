                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera var. spathulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a compact, spherical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
