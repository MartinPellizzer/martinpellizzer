                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus var. fertilis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. fertilis, commonly known as the Indian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in preventing erosion in sandy landscapes.</p>
