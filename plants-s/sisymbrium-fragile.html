                    <h1>Sisymbrium fragile</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium fragile, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and a taproot system, which allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
