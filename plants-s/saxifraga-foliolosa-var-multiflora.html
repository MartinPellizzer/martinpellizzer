                    <h1>Saxifraga foliolosa var. multiflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga foliolosa var. multiflora, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens in cooler climates.</p>
