                    <h1>Salix sessilifolia var. villosa</h1>
<p>Salix sessilifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
