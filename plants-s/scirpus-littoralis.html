<p>Scirpus littoralis, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and it produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Scirpus littoralis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
