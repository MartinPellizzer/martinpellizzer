                    <h1>Skoliostigma defolians</h1>
<p>Skoliostigma defolians, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential threat to forest ecosystems.</p>
