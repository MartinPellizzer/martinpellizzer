                    <h1>Selaginella sintenisii</h1>
<p>Selaginella sintenisii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, losing up to 95% of its water content and appearing dead, only to revive when rehydrated. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a unique, compact appearance. The plant reproduces via spores and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant.</p>
