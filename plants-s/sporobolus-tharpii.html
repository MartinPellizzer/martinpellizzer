<p>Sporobolus tharpii, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are typically three-awned, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation in harsh environments. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Sporobolus tharpii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
