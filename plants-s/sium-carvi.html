                    <h1>Sium carvi</h1>
<p>Sium carvi, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, carrot-like roots and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant grows in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Its small white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Sium carvi is often mistaken for water hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it is not toxic and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
