<p>Schoepfia multiflora, commonly known as the desert sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Schoepfia multiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
