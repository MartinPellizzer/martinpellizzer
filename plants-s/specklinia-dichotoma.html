                    <h1>Specklinia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Specklinia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that divide into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Specklinia dichotoma plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
