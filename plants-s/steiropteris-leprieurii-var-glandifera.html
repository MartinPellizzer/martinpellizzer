                    <h1>Steiropteris leprieurii var. glandifera</h1>
<p>Steiropteris leprieurii var. glandifera, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and contributing to its structural stability.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
