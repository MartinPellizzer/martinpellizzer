<p>Schefflera minimiflora, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, rounded canopy of dark green, glossy leaves that are typically small and clustered at the ends of short stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Schefflera minimiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care.</p>
