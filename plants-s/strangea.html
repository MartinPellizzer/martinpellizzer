                    <h1>Strangea</h1>
<p>Strangea, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, dandelion-like flowers that typically bloom in spring and summer. Strangea species are native to regions in Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped or elliptic, and their stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their bright yellow flowers.</p>
