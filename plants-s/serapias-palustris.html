<p>Serapias palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Serapias palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
