                    <h1>Symphytum hirsutum</h1>
<p>Symphytum hirsutum, commonly known as woolly groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a single head at the end of each stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional remedies.</p>
