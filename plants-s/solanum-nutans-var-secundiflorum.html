<p>Solanum nutans var. secundiflorum, commonly known as the hanging nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features trailing stems that often hang over the edges of containers or rock formations, producing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces berries that change from green to red as they mature, and the leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
