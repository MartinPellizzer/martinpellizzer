<p>Sanguinaria canadensis var. multiplex, commonly known as the red puccoon, is a variant of the bloodroot plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its distinctive red-orange sap, which is toxic and has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. The plant features a single, palmately lobed leaf and a single, white, bell-shaped flower that blooms in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, woodland soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
