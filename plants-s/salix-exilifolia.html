                    <h1>Salix exilifolia</h1>
<p>Salix exilifolia, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Salix exilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing fragile alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
