                    <h1>Scleria caespitosa</h1>
<p>Scleria caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on slender, leafless stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in moist soils.</p>
<p>Scleria caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
