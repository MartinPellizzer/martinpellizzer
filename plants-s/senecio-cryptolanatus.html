                    <h1>Senecio cryptolanatus</h1>
<p>Senecio cryptolanatus, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
