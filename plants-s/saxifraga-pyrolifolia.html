<p>Saxifraga pyrolifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga pyrolifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
