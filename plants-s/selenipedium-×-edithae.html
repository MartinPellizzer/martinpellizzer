                    <h1>Selenipedium × edithae</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × edithae, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium australianum, two species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It grows as an epiphytic plant, often found clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
