<p>Serjania rigida, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Serjaniae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Serjania rigida is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
