                    <h1>Sabulina lanceolata var. usneoides</h1>
<p>Sabulina lanceolata var. usneoides, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often mistaken for moss due to their dense, hanging appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in coastal or inland desert regions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
