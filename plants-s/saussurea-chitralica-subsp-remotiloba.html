<p>Saussurea chitralica subsp.</p>
<p>remotiloba, commonly known as the Chitral saffron, is a rare and high-altitude plant native to the northern regions of Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, yellowish-orange inflorescence that resembles saffron, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has fibrous roots and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
