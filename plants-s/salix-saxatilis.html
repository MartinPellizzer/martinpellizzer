                    <h1>Salix saxatilis</h1>
<p>Salix saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile willow, is a deciduous shrub native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
