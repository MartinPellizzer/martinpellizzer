                    <h1>Spinifex squarrosus</h1>
<p>Spinifex squarrosus, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiny bristles along its stems. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a common component of coastal and inland dunes. Its small, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Spinifex squarrosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert fauna.</p>
