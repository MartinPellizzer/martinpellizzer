<p>Salix platycarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, cylindrical catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix platycarpa is often found along stream banks and in wetlands, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
