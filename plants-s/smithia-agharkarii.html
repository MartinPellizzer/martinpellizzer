<p>Smithia agharkarii, commonly known as the Agharkari stonecrop, is a rare succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid environment. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Smithia agharkarii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
