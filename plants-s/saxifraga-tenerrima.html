                    <h1>Saxifraga tenerrima</h1>
<p>Saxifraga tenerrima, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga tenerrima is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
