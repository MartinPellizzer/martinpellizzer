<p>Sclerandrium tenax, commonly known as the rigid sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Sclerandrium tenax is often found in coastal dunes and dry shrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
