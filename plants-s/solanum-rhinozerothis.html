                    <h1>Solanum rhinozerothis</h1>
<p>Solanum rhinozerothis, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is generally avoided as a food source and is more often recognized for its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
