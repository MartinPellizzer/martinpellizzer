<p>Stipagrostis plumosa var. aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
