                    <h1>Scordium palustre</h1>
<p>Scordium palustre, commonly known as the marsh scordium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>Scordium palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
