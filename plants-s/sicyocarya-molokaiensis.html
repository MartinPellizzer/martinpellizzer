                    <h1>Sicyocarya molokaiensis</h1>
<p>Sicyocarya molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokaʻi rock cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Hawaiian island of Molokaʻi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
