<p>Saxifraga fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>fragilis, commonly known as the fragile saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features succulent, often blue-green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The species produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, usually arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in moist, shaded microhabitats within its native range.</p>
