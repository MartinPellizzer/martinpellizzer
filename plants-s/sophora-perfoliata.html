<p>Sophora perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often described as having a "perfoliate" arrangement, where the leaves appear to pass through the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Sophora perfoliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
