                    <h1>Salix rorismarinifolia</h1>
<p>Salix rorismarinifolia, commonly known as the sea willow, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. Its root system is highly adaptable, allowing it to thrive in sandy or saline soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Salix rorismarinifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
