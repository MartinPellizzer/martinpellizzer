                    <h1>Striga warneckei</h1>
<p>Striga warneckei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Somalia. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and shrubs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, round seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ecological impact, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
