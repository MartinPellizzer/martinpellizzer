                    <h1>Stylidium striatum</h1>
<p>Stylidium striatum, commonly known as the striped sun-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a unique structure called a galea, which is a specialized petal that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Stylidium striatum typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of plant adaptation and pollination strategies.</p>
