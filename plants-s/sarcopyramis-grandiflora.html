<p>Sarcopyramis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flameflower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red bracts that resemble petals, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Sarcopyramis grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
