<p>Saxifraga aristulata, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features upright stems with clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aristulata is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
