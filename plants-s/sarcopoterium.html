                    <h1>Sarcopoterium</h1>
<p>Sarcopoterium, commonly known as the desert sage or silverleaf sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sarcopoterium species typically have small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow or white.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
