                    <h1>Sphyrastylis dalstromii</h1>
<p>Sphyrastylis dalstromii, commonly known as the Dalstrom's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its long, slender petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
