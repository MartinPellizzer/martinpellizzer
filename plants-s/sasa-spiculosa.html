                <h1>Sasa spiculosa</h1>
<p>Sasa spiculosa, commonly known as the spiky bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its stiff, upright culms that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense thickets, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
<p>Sasa spiculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and unique foliage.</p>
