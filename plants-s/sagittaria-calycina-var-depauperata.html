                    <h1>Sagittaria calycina var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria calycina var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender arrowhead, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its habitat. Its leaves are usually floating or partially submerged, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters, making it an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
