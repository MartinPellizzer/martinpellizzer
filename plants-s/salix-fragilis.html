                <h1>Salix fragilis</h1>
<p>Salix fragilis, commonly known as brittle willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is thin and easily peeled. It thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate branches, it is also known for its fragility, which gives it its common name.</p>
