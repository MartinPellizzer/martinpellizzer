                    <h1>Salicornia neei</h1>
<p>Salicornia neei, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and estuaries.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to tolerate high salinity.</p>
<p>Salicornia neei plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
