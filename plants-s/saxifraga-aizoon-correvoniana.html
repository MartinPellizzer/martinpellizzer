                    <h1>Saxifraga aizoon correvoniana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aizoon correvoniana, commonly known as the Correvon saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, sun-exposed environments of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
