                <h1>Schoenus circinalis</h1>
<p>Schoenus circinalis, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands.</p>
<p>Schoenus circinalis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in swamps, lakes, and riverine environments.</p>
