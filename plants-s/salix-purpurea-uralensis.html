<p>Salix purpurea uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
