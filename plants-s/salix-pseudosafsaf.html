<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that give it a weeping appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
