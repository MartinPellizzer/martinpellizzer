<p>Stipa lagascae subsp.</p>
<p>letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
