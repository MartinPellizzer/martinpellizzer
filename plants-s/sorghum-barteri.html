                    <h1>Sorghum barteri</h1>
<p>Sorghum barteri, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a resilient grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It is often used as a forage crop for livestock due to its hardiness and nutritional value.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sorghum barteri plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
