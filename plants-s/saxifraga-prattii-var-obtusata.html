<p>Saxifraga prattii var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically features compact rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves that are rounded or blunt at the tips. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
