                    <h1>Selaginella excurrens var. glazioviana</h1>
<p>Selaginella excurrens var. glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It exhibits a unique ability to survive in arid conditions through its capacity for cryptobiosis, a state of suspended animation that allows it to endure extreme drought.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it an important component of its ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
