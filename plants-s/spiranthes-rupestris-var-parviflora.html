<p>Spiranthes rupestris var. parviflora, commonly known as the rock twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its specialized root system.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Spiranthes species by its smaller, more delicate flowers and specific habitat preferences.</p>
