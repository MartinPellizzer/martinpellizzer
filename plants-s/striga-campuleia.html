                    <h1>Striga campuleia</h1>
<p>Striga campuleia, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
