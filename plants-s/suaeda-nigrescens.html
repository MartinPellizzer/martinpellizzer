                    <h1>Suaeda nigrescens</h1>
<p>Suaeda nigrescens, commonly known as black saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought and high salt concentrations. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds via wind.</p>
<p>Suaeda nigrescens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
