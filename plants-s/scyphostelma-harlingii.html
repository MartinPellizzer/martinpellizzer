<p>Scyphostelma harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypsela.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scyphostelma harlingii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
