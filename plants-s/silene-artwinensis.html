<p>Silene artwinensis, commonly known as the Artvin catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or grassy slopes, preferring cool and moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Silene artwinensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its mountainous environment.</p>
