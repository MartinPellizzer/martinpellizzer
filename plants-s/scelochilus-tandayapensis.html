                    <h1>Scelochilus tandayapensis</h1>
<p>Scelochilus tandayapensis, commonly known as the Tandayapé orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the cloud forests of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss, while its roots form extensive networks to anchor it in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
