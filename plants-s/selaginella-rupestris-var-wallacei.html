                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. wallacei</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to arid and rocky environments, this plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on specialized branches and contain spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
