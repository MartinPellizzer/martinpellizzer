                    <h1>Sipanea pratensis var. dichotoma</h1>
<p>Sipanea pratensis var. dichotoma, commonly known as the forked sipanea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, ascending stems that often branch at the base, giving it its characteristic "forked" appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to wet environments.</p>
