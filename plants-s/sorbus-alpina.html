                    <h1>Sorbus alpina</h1>
<p>Sorbus alpina, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. Sorbus alpina typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
