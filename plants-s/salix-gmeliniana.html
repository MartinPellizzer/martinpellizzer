                    <h1>Salix gmeliniana</h1>
<p>Salix gmeliniana, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and its leaves are typically narrow and serrated. It has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
