                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum macphersonii</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum macphersonii, commonly known as the MacPherson's ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rafflesiaceae, which is known for its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, stems, or roots. The plant is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of significant botanical interest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Sciodaphyllum macphersonii remains one of the least understood species in the plant kingdom.</p>
