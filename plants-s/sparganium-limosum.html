<p>Sparganium limosum, commonly known as bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, while its flowering spikes rise above the water surface. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in spherical heads, which are often mistaken for seed pods.</p>
