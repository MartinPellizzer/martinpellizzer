                    <h1>Shiia cuspidata var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Shiia cuspidata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited shiia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it competes with other shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
