<p>Senegalia langsdorffii, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisting branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Senegalia langsdorffii is often used for forage, soil stabilization, and traditional medicine in its native habitats.</p>
