<p>Sorbus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is gray and fissured, and it often develops distinctive, flaky exfoliating bark as it matures.</p>
<p>Sorbus macrophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
