                    <h1>Selaginella elegans</h1>
<p>Selaginella elegans, commonly known as the "resurrection plant," is a unique species of spiky, low-growing fern-like plant.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. This plant is renowned for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, drying out completely and then reviving when water becomes available. Its tiny, scale-like leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces microspores and megaspores in specialized structures called microsporangia and megasporangia.</p>
<p>Selaginella elegans is often used in scientific research to study drought tolerance and plant survival mechanisms.</p>
