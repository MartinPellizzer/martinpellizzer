                    <h1>Solidago virgaurea var. minutissima</h1>
<p>Solidago virgaurea var. minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces.</p>
<p>Despite its modest appearance, it plays a valuable role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
