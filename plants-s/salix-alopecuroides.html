                    <h1>Salix alopecuroides</h1>
<p>Salix alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates.</p>
