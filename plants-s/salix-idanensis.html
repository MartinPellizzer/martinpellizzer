                    <h1>Salix idanensis</h1>
<p>Salix idanensis, commonly known as the Idanensis willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow catkins that are adapted to the harsh, dry climate it inhabits. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Salix idanensis is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
