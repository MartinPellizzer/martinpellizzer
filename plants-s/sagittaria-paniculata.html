                    <h1>Sagittaria paniculata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria paniculata, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects and wind. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Sagittaria paniculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
