                    <h1>Sphenopholis annua</h1>
<p>Sphenopholis annua, commonly known as the annual sphenophyllum, is a member of the Sphenophyta, a group of ancient vascular plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Sphenopholis annua is considered a relic species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
