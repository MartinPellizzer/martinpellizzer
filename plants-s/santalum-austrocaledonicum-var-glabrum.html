<p>Santalum austrocaledonicum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to New Caledonia.</p>

The plant has small, simple leaves and produces fragrant yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties, though it is rarely used due to its scarcity and conservation status.</p>
<p>The species is critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical entity.</p>
