<p>Strychnos polytrichantha, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
