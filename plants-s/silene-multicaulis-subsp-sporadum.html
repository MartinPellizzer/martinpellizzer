<p>Silene multicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>sporadum, commonly known as the nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie prostrate on the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral structure and the presence of specialized root nodules that host nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
