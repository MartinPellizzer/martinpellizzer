                    <h1>Sponia orientalis var. affinis</h1>
<p>Sponia orientalis var. affinis, commonly known as the Eastern Sponia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, velvety foliage that turns a striking silver-green in autumn. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and lavender, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
