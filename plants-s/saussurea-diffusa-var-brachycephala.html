<p>Saussurea diffusa var. brachycephala, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and a compact, rounded flower head that resembles a small, white or pale yellow ball. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
