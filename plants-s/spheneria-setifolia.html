<p>Spheneria setifolia, commonly known as the hairy spheneria, is a small, aquatic moss belonging to the family Spheneriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Spheneria setifolia plays a role in stabilizing aquatic substrates and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
