<p>Smyrnium perfoliatum subsp.</p>
<p>rotundifolium, commonly known as round-leaved hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white, veined underside.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its hollow stems that often appear to pass through the leaves, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
