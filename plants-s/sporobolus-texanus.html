<p>Sporobolus texanus, commonly known as Texas dropseed, is a native grass species found primarily in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Sporobolus texanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
