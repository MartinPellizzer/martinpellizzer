                    <h1>Schweinfurthia imbricata</h1>
<p>Schweinfurthia imbricata, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a tight, overlapping pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Schweinfurthia imbricata is often found in alpine meadows and mountain tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
