                            <h1>Satureja Breviflora</h1>
<p>Greek thyme, scientifically known as Satureja breviflora, is a fragrant herb native to the rocky soils of southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. This hardy perennial plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. Often used in cooking and traditional medicine, it has a long history of culinary and therapeutic applications. Its small, pinkish flowers attract pollinators, making it a beneficial addition to gardens. Despite its modest appearance, Greek thyme holds a special place in both horticulture and cultural heritage.</p>
