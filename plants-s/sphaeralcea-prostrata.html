<p>Sphaeralcea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate globemallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden environments.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea prostrata is also valued for its ability to support pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
