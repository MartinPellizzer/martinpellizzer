<p>Senecio xerophilus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Senecio xerophilus is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
