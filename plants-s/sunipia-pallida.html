                    <h1>Sunipia pallida</h1>
<p>Sunipia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Sunipia pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
