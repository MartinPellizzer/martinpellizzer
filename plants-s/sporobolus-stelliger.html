                    <h1>Sporobolus stelliger</h1>
<p>Sporobolus stelliger, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is well adapted to coastal environments, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Sporobolus stelliger plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
