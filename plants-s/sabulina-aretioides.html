<p>Sabulina aretioides, commonly known as the sand gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
