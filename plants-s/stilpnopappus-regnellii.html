                    <h1>Stilpnopappus regnellii</h1>
<p>Stilpnopappus regnellii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Stilpnopappus regnellii is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
