<p>Syndyophyllum excelsum subsp.</p>
<p>occidentale, commonly known as the Western star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is a perennial species that prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
