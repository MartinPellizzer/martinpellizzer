<p>Schizoglossum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Schizoglossum abyssinicum is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
