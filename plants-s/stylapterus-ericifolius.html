                    <h1>Stylapterus ericifolius</h1>
<p>Stylapterus ericifolius, commonly known as the heath lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on tree trunks, branches, and soil in heathlands and boreal forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator species for environmental stability.</p>
