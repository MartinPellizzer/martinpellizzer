                    <h1>Schoenus corniculatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus corniculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clusters with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenus corniculatus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor wetlands.</p>
