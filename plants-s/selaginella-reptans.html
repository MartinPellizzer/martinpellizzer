<p>Selaginella reptans, commonly known as the thread moss or common spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella reptans reproduces via spores, which are released from cone-like structures called strobila.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental appeal.</p>
