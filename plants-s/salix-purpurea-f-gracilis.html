<p>Salix purpurea f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or purple bloom. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, ponds, or other water bodies. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
