                    <h1>Scirpus schaffneri</h1>
<p>Scirpus schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically found at the top of the stem. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important pioneer species in wetland restoration.</p>
<p>Scirpus schaffneri plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
