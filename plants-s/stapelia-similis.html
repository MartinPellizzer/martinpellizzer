                    <h1>Stapelia similis</h1>
<p>Stapelia similis, commonly known as the false crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia similis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
