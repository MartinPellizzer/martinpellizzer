<p>Scirpus boeckelerianus, commonly known as the Boeckeler's bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of dark brown or black flowering spikes that appear at the top of its slender, grass-like stems. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus boeckelerianus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water in its natural habitat.</p>
