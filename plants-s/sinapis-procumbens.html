<p>Sinapis procumbens, commonly known as creeping mustard, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
