<p>Sedum × nicaeense subsp.</p>
<p>dianium, commonly known as the silver rose, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale pink to white flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes.</p>
