                    <h1>Salsola subglabra</h1>
<p>Salsola subglabra, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Salsola subglabra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
