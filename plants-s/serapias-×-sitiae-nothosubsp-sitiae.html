<p>Serapias × sitiae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sitiae, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Serapias auricoma and Serapias norrisii. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, preferring moist, calcareous soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range.</p>
