<p>Selaginella rubescens, commonly known as the red spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that turn reddish in color, especially when exposed to sunlight. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its tissues. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Selaginella rubescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
