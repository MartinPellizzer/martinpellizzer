                    <h1>Selaginella bryoides</h1>
<p>Selaginella bryoides, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant has a root system that anchors it to moist, acidic soils, and its leaves are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Selaginella bryoides reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
