                    <h1>Schizophyllum</h1>
<p>Schizophyllum, commonly known as the wood spleen or the split skin mushroom, is a genus of fungi in the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, irregularly branched fruiting bodies that often resemble a brain or a sponge. The caps are typically small and convex, with a fibrous, leathery texture. Schizophyllum species are saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and other organic matter.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
