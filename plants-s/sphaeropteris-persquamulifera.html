                    <h1>Sphaeropteris persquamulifera</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris persquamulifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed cyclosorus, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
