                    <h1>Senegalia erythrocalyx</h1>
<p>Senegalia erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-colored leaves, which are often clustered in spines, and its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for both humans and animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senegalia erythrocalyx also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
