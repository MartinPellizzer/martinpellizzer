<p>Spartium rostratum, commonly known as narrowleaf sicklevetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces seed pods that are curved and resemble a sickle, giving it its common name. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Spartium rostratum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
