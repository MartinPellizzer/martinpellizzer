<p>Strigilia pallida, commonly known as the pale strigil, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and pale, waxy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along streambanks. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Strigilia pallida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
