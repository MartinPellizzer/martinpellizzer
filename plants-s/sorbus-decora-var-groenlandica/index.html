                            <h1>Sorbus Decora Var. Groenlandica</h1>
<p>Sorbus decora var. groenlandica is a rare and striking member of the rose family known for its unique ornamental features. This variety of whitebeams is native to the Arctic regions of Greenland and exhibits a striking white to pinkish hue during the flowering season. It thrives in harsh, cold climates and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a desirable addition to specialized gardens. Despite its beauty, it remains a lesser-known plant in horticultural circles due to its limited distribution and cultivation challenges.</p>
