<p>Sisymbrium sophia f. gracile, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions such as Europe and parts of Asia. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an interesting subject for ecological studies.</p>
