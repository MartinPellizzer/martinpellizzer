                    <h1>Schoenus ciliaris</h1>
<p>Schoenus ciliaris, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenus ciliaris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
