                    <h1>Sarcocyphula</h1>
<p>Sarcocyphula, commonly known as the ghost cup, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Sarcoscyphaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their unique, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. They typically grow on decaying wood, especially in moist, shaded environments. The spore-producing structures are usually small and clustered, contributing to their elusive nature.</p>
<p>Sarcocyphula species are of interest to mycologists due to their distinctive morphology and ecological role in decomposing organic matter.</p>
