<p>Stictophyllum, commonly known as the liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. Stictophyllum has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the thallus.</p>
<p>These plants play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
