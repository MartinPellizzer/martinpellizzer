                    <h1>Senecio cuspidatus var. ceratophyllus</h1>
<p>Senecio cuspidatus var. ceratophyllus, commonly known as the horned senecio, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems with dense clusters of small, spiky, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
