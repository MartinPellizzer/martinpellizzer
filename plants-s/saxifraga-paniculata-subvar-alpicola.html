<p>Saxifraga paniculata subvar. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and have a waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subvariety is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive.</p>
