                    <h1>Schizomeria parvifolia</h1>
<p>Schizomeria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved schizomeria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schizomeria parvifolia is adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native desert ecosystems.</p>
