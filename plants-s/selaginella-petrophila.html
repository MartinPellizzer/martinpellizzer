                    <h1>Selaginella petrophila</h1>
<p>Selaginella petrophila, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a characteristic known as heterospory. Its leaves are small, linear, and often arranged in whorls, with a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>Selaginella petrophila is of great interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and adaptation to extreme habitats.</p>
