<p>Sophora fraseri, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to purple pea-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
