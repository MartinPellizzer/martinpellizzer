<p>Saurauia tewensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian stonecrop, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saurauia tewensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
