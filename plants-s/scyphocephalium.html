                    <h1>Scyphocephalium</h1>
<p>Scyphocephalium, commonly known as the "dwarf rockrose," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Scyphocephalium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, and their compact growth habit makes them ideal for small garden spaces.</p>
