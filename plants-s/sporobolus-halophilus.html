                    <h1>Sporobolus halophilus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus halophilus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other soils with high salt content. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic that aids in its survival in harsh, open habitats.</p>
<p>Sporobolus halophilus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in salt-affected regions.</p>
