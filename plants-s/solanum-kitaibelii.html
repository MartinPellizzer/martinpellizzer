                    <h1>Solanum kitaibelii</h1>
<p>Solanum kitaibelii, commonly known as the purple potato or wild potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, purple-tinged tubers underground. These tubers are not typically cultivated for food but are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Solanum kitaibelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
