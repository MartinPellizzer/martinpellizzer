                    <h1>Stylidium lithophilum</h1>
<p>Stylidium lithophilum, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a unique flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant has a slender, twining stem that lacks true leaves, relying instead on its yellowish flowers for reproduction. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
