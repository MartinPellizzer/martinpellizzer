<p>Styphelia woodsii, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Styphelia woodsii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to cool, humid climates and its role as a component of montane and alpine ecosystems.</p>
