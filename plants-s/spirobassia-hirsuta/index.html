                            <h1>Spirobassia Hirsuta</h1>
<p>Hairy spurge, scientifically known as Spirobassia hirsuta, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, making it both a marvel and a caution in the wild. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a subject of interest for botanists and desert enthusiasts alike.</p>
