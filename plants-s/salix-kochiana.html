                    <h1>Salix kochiana</h1>
<p>Salix kochiana, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
