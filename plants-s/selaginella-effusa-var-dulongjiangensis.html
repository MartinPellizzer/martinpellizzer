                    <h1>Selaginella effusa var. dulongjiangensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella effusa var. dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulongjiang Spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which is a key feature of its evolutionary adaptation. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant evolution and conservation biology.</p>
