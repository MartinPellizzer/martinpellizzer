                    <h1>Selaginella flabelliformis</h1>
<p>Selaginella flabelliformis, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spiky, evergreen fern that exhibits remarkable desiccation tolerance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. The plant's leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. When dry, it appears to be dead, but it can revive when exposed to moisture, hence its common name.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to survive extreme drought conditions, making it a fascinating example of plant resilience.</p>
