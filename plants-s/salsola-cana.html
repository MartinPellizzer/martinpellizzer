<p>Salsola cana, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in many regions.</p>
<p>Salsola cana is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation.</p>
