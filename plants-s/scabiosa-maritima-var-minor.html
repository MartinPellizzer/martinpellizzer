                    <h1>Scabiosa maritima var. minor</h1>
<p>Scabiosa maritima var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branching stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a similar silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
