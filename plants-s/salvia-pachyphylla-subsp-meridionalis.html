<p>Salvia pachyphylla subsp.</p>
<p>meridionalis, commonly known as the southern thickleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a botanical adaptation to its drought-prone environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
