                    <h1>Saxifraga cordillerarum var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cordillerarum var. nivalis, commonly known as the Sierra snow saxifraga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh conditions. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid, high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and its ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions.</p>
