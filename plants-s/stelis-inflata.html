<p>Stelis inflata, commonly known as the inflated stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stelis inflata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
