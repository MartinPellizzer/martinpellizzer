                    <h1>Stigmatosema draculoides</h1>
<p>Stigmatosema draculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically valued for its medicinal and preservative properties. Its growth habit and appearance resemble that of a tree, despite being a shrub-like species.</p>
<p>Stigmatosema draculoides is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
