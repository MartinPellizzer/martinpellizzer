                    <h1>Sarcococca pruniformis var. hookeriana</h1>
<p>Sarcococca pruniformis var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit.</p>
