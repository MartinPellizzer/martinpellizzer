                    <h1>Striga indica</h1>
<p>Striga indica, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests the roots of cereal crops such as maize, sorghum, and millet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crop yields, Striga indica is a significant challenge for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
