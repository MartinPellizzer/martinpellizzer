<p>Sium crassipes, commonly known as broad-leaved water pepper, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist environments.</p>
<p>Sium crassipes plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
