The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its habitat.</p>
