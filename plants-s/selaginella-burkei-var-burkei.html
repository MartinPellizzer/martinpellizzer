                    <h1>Selaginella burkei var. burkei</h1>
<p>Selaginella burkei var. burkei, commonly known as the Burkill's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, with spores being the primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
