                    <h1>Sabazia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Sabazia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in forested areas, particularly in association with pine trees.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a bright green to yellowish thallus that often forms dense mats on tree bark. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
<p>Sabazia pinetorum is typically found in humid, temperate climates where it can grow on the trunks and branches of coniferous trees.</p>
