                    <h1>Spergularia diandroides</h1>
<p>Spergularia diandroides, commonly known as the two-sexed sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal areas of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that grows close to the ground, often in disturbed or arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Spergularia diandroides is notable for its sexual dimorphism, with separate male and female plants, a rare trait in flowering plants.</p>
