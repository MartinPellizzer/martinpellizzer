                    <h1>Saccharum fallax</h1>
<p>Saccharum fallax, commonly known as the false sugar cane, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. While it resembles true sugar cane, it is not economically valuable for sugar production.</p>
<p>Its ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates.</p>
