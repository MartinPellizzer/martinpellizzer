                    <h1>Staphylodendron</h1>
<p>Staphylodendron, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. They are characterized by their large, palm-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The wood of Staphylodendron species is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it popular in the furniture and construction industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
