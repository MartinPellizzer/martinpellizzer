                    <h1>Sarracenia adunca</h1>
<p>Sarracenia adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form tubular traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are usually red or orange with a distinctive black midrib, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to maintain its digestive processes.</p>
<p>Sarracenia adunca is often found in bogs and swamps, where it plays a unique role in the local ecosystem.</p>
