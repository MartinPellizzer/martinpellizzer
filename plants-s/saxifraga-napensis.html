<p>Saxifraga napensis, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga napensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
