                    <h1>Salsola dendroides</h1>
<p>Salsola dendroides, commonly known as bush saltwort, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and salt deserts.</p>
<p>Salsola dendroides plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
