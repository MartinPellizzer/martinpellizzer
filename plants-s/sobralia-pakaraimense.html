The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks in the humid, shaded environments of the rainforest canopy. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
