The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Schoenus vendeanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
