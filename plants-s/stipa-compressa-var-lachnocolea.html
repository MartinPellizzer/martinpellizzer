                    <h1>Stipa compressa var. lachnocolea</h1>
<p>Stipa compressa var. lachnocolea, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, compressed leaves and compact inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The grass is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
