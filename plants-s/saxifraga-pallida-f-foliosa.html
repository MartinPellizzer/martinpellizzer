                    <h1>Saxifraga pallida f. foliosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pallida f. foliosa, commonly known as the pale saxifrage foliage form, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, pale green to silver-white leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or woolly hair. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it well-suited for high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The foliage form (f. foliosa) is distinguished by its more pronounced and expanded leaf structure compared to the typical variety.</p>
