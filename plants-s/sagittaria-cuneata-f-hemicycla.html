The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems.</p>
