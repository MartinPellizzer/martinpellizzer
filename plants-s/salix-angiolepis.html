                    <h1>Salix angiolepis</h1>
<p>Salix angiolepis, commonly known as the American weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures.</p>
<p>Salix angiolepis is often found near water sources, such as rivers and lakes, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
