                    <h1>Sorbus chamaemespilus var. arioides</h1>
<p>Sorbus chamaemespilus var. arioides, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal changes in foliage and fruiting display.</p>
