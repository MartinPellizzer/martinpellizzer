<p>Syncalathium chrysocephala, commonly known as the golden-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
