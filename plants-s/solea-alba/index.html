                            <h1>Solea Alba</h1>
<p>White sole, scientifically known as Solea alba, is a flatfish species native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent body and distinctive eye placement, with both eyes on the right side of its head. This fish typically inhabits sandy and muddy seabeds, often burrowing into the substrate to avoid predators. The white sole is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishing due to its delicate flavor and firm texture. Its ecological role and culinary significance make it an important species in marine ecosystems and seafood markets.</p>
