                    <h1>Salix × subversifolia</h1>
<p>Salix × subversifolia, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix × subversifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
