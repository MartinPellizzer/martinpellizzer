<p>Saracha spinosa, commonly known as the spiny saracha, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Saracha spinosa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
