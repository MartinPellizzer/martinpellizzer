                    <h1>Sarracenia alata f. viridescens</h1>
<p>Sarracenia alata f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-flowered pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is a variant of Sarracenia alata, characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitfall traps to capture insects. The leaves are typically green, with a striking red or purple midrib and a narrow, hooded lip that helps guide prey into the trap. This plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture and sunlight.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
