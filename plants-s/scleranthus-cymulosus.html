                    <h1>Scleranthus cymulosus</h1>
<p>Scleranthus cymulosus, commonly known as the clustered scarlet sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to dry, sandy soils in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Scleranthus cymulosus is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
