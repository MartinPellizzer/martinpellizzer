<p>Staurogyne yamokmehong, commonly known as the Malayan water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lyguloideae and is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving waters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Staurogyne yamokmehong is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to control algae and improve water quality.</p>
