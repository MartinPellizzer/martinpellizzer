<p>Swartzia macrosema, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Swartzia macrosema is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
