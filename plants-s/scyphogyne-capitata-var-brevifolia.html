                    <h1>Scyphogyne capitata var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Scyphogyne capitata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved scyphogyne, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structures. The plant features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense, compact clusters at the center of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value.</p>
