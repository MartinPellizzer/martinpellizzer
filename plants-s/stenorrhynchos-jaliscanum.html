<p>Stenorrhynchos jaliscanum, commonly known as the Jalisco orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it attaches itself to tree bark. Its flowers are short-lived but attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
