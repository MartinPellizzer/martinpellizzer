                    <h1>Senegalia cheilanthifolia</h1>
<p>Senegalia cheilanthifolia, commonly known as the desert bristlecone, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small compound leaves, and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that opens to release the seeds when dry.</p>
<p>Senegalia cheilanthifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
