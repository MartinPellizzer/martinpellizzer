<p>Salix longifolia argophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a distinctive bluish-green color on the upper surface and a silvery-gray underside. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are clustered in groups of 2â€“5, and is often found in moist, riparian habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks and preventing erosion.</p>
