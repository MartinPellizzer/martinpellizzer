<p>Selaginella hachijoense, commonly known as the Hachijo clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Japan, specifically the island of Hachijo-jima, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive creeping growth habit with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its stems. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
