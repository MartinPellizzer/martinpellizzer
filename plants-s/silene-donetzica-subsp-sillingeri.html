<p>Silene donetzica subsp.</p>
<p>sillingeri, commonly known as the Donets Basin catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
