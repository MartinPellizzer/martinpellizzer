                    <h1>Scleropoa rigida var. spicata</h1>
<p>Scleropoa rigida var. spicata, commonly known as the rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
