<p>Stamnorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Stamnorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
