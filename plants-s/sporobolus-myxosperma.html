                    <h1>Sporobolus myxosperma</h1>
<p>Sporobolus myxosperma, commonly known as the sticky spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes allow it to form dense colonies, which can dominate wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Sporobolus myxosperma make it well adapted to moist, disturbed environments.</p>
