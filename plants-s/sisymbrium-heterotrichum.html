                    <h1>Sisymbrium heterotrichum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium heterotrichum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, but it does not produce typical flowers or seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various parts of North America. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with host plants, often leading to reduced growth in the host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
