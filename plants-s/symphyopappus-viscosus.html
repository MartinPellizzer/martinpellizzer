                    <h1>Symphyopappus viscosus</h1>
<p>Symphyopappus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a composite structure composed of multiple achene-like seeds surrounded by a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Symphyopappus viscosus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
