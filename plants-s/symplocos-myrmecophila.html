                    <h1>Symplocos myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Symplocos myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, swollen nodes on its stems that serve as shelters for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. The plant also produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries.</p>
<p>Symplocos myrmecophila is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
