                    <h1>Specularia parviflora f. balearica</h1>
<p>Specularia parviflora f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It features compact rosettes of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive white markings, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
