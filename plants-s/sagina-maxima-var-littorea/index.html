                            <h1>Sagina Maxima Var. Littorea</h1>
<p>Sagina maxima var. littorea is a small, low-growing plant commonly found in moist coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen along the edges of beaches and salt marshes. This variety is known for its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand salty air and strong winds. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
