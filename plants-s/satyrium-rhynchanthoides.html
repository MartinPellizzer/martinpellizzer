<p>Satyrium rhynchanthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in lowland areas with rich, moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>This orchid plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for various pollinators.</p>
