                    <h1>Salix pseudolapponum var. kenosha</h1>
<p>Salix pseudolapponum var. kenosha, commonly known as the Kenosha willow, is a shrub native to the upper Midwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found along stream banks and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in riparian zones.</p>
