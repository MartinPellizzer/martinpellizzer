<p>Schomburgkia thomsoniana var. minor, commonly known as the Thomson's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of purple and yellow hues. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural environment.</p>
