                    <h1>Scleria lagoensis</h1>
<p>Scleria lagoensis, commonly known as the marsh speargrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria lagoensis typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
