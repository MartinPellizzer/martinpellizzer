                    <h1>Sporobolus minuartioides</h1>
<p>Sporobolus minuartioides, commonly known as the mountain sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high elevation environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous growth habit and the ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus minuartioides is adapted to drought and can survive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
