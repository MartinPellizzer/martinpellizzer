                    <h1>Stelis tabacina</h1>
<p>Stelis tabacina, commonly known as the Tobacco Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers often bloom in late summer or early autumn, and it prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Stelis tabacina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
