                    <h1>Salsola minutifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola minutifolia, commonly known as dwarf Russian thistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-adapted to harsh environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
<p>Salsola minutifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain wildlife species.</p>
