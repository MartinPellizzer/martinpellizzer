                    <h1>Stipa desertorum</h1>
<p>Stipa desertorum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Stipa desertorum is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
