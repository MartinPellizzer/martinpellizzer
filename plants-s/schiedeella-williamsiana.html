<p>Schiedeella williamsiana, commonly known as the Williams' schiedea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Schiedeella williamsiana is also notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
