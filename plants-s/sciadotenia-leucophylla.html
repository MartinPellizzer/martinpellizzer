                    <h1>Sciadotenia leucophylla</h1>
<p>Sciadotenia leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by tiny, fleshy berries that attract birds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the nutrient cycle of its host tree.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>
