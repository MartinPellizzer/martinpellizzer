                    <h1>Seris adpressa</h1>
<p>Seris adpressa, commonly known as the flatleaf seris, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are closely pressed to the stem, a feature that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small groups along the stems.</p>
<p>Seris adpressa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
