<p>Salix styligera, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as alpine tundras and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, often multi-branched stems with small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in short, soft hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras.</p>
<p>Salix styligera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range.</p>
