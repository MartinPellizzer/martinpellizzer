<p>Salix interior var. pedicellata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range.</p>
