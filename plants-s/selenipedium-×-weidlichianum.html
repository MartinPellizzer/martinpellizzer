                    <h1>Selenipedium × weidlichianum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × weidlichianum, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, thin petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical classification places it within the Orchidaceae family, and it is notable for its slow growth and high conservation status.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
