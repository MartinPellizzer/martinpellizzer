                    <h1>Spraguea caespitosa</h1>
<p>Spraguea caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spraguea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense clusters, which help it compete in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Spraguea caespitosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in forest understories.</p>
