                    <h1>Sabulina tenuifolia var. vaillantiana</h1>
<p>Sabulina tenuifolia var. vaillantiana, commonly known as the slenderleaf sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
