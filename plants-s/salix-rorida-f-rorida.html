<p>Salix rorida f. rorida, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring, and it produces catkins that release seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
