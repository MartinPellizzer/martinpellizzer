<p>Stapelia hircosa var. densa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, resembling the appearance of a corpse, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
