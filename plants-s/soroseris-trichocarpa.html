<p>Soroseris trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy leaf soroseris, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy or open habitats and has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>Soroseris trichocarpa is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
