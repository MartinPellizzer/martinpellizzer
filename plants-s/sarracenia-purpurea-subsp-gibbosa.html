<p>Sarracenia purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>gibbosa, commonly known as the purple swamp pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are typically red or purple in color, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>The subspecies gibbosa is distinguished by its broader, more robust pitchers compared to the typical S. purpurea.</p>
