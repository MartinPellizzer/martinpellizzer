                    <h1>Syringodea epistomia</h1>
<p>Syringodea epistomia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Syringodea epistomia is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
