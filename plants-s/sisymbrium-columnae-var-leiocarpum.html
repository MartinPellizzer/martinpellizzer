The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes or other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, facilitating its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
