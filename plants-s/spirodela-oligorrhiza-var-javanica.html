                    <h1>Spirodela oligorrhiza var. javanica</h1>
<p>Spirodela oligorrhiza var. javanica, commonly known as the water velvet, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky layer of air-filled cells, which help it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
