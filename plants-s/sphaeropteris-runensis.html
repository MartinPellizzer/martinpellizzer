                    <h1>Sphaeropteris runensis</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris runensis, commonly known as the Run Island cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, typical of cycads, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
