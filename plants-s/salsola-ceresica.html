                    <h1>Salsola ceresica</h1>
<p>Salsola ceresica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many areas.</p>
<p>Salsola ceresica is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands.</p>
