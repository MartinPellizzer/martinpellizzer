                    <h1>Stelis listerophora</h1>
<p>Stelis listerophora, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil.</p>
<p>Stelis listerophora is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
