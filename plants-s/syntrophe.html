<p>Syntrophe, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or spoon-shaped, with a hairy surface.

<p>Syntrophe species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
