                    <h1>Sporobolus rangei</h1>
<p>Sporobolus rangei, commonly known as rough sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus rangei produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae.</p>
