                    <h1>Sambucus ebulus f. xerophila</h1>
<p>Sambucus ebulus f. xerophila, commonly known as the desert elderberry, is a rare and specialized variant of the elderberry plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It exhibits a compact growth form with reduced leaf size and thicker cuticles to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, similar to other elderberries, is typically small and dark, though less commonly consumed due to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
