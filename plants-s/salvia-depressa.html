                    <h1>Salvia depressa</h1>
<p>Salvia depressa, commonly known as the prostrate sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Salvia depressa is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
