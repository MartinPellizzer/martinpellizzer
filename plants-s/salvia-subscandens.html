<p>Salvia subscandens, commonly known as Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>Salvia subscandens is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements.</p>
