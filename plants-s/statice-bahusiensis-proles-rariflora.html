                    <h1>Statice bahusiensis proles rariflora</h1>
<p>Statice bahusiensis proles rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
