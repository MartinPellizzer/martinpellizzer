                    <h1>Santalum lanceolatum var. oblongatum</h1>
<p>Santalum lanceolatum var. oblongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host trees through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its timber is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
