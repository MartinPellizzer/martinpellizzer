                    <h1>Syntherisma hayatae var. magna</h1>
<p>Syntherisma hayatae var. magna, commonly known as the giant syntherism, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, which are typically a vibrant green with a slight waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
