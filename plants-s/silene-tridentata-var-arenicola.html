<p>Silene tridentata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert environments. Its flowering period is brief, typically lasting only a few weeks, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction.</p>
<p>Silene tridentata var. arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem.</p>
