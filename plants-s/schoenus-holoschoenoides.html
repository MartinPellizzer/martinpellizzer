                    <h1>Schoenus holoschoenoides</h1>
<p>Schoenus holoschoenoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Schoenus holoschoenoides plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
