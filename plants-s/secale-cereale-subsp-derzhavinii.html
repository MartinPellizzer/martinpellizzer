<p>Secale cereale subsp.</p>
<p>derzhavinii, commonly known as the Derzhavin's rye, is a rare subspecies of rye that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers. Its seeds are smaller than those of common rye and have a more pronounced husk.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic diversity.</p>
