<p>Salvia pseudoavicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The genus Salvia is known for its medicinal and aromatic properties, though specific uses of S. pseudoavicularis are less documented.</p>
