<p>Salvia arduinervis, commonly known as the alpine blue sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts.</p>
