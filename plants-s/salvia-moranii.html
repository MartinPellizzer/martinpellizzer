                    <h1>Salvia moranii</h1>
<p>Salvia moranii, commonly known as the Moran's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Salvia moranii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
