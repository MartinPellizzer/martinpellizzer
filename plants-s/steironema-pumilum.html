                    <h1>Steironema pumilum</h1>
<p>Steironema pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short, hairy stems. Steironema pumilum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in desert ecosystems.</p>
