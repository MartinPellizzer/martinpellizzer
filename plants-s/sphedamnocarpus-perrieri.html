                    <h1>Sphedamnocarpus perrieri</h1>
<p>Sphedamnocarpus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a gymnosperm, adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native environment.</p>
