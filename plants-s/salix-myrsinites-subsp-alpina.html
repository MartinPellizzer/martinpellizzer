<p>Salix myrsinites subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, rocky environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
