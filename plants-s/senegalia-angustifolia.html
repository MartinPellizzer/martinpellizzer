<p>Senegalia angustifolia, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Senegalia angustifolia is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
