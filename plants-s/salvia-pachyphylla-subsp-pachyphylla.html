<p>Salvia pachyphylla subsp.</p>
<p>pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources.</p>
