                    <h1>Salix hugelii</h1>
<p>Salix hugelii, commonly known as Hugel's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male flowers that release pollen, while female flowers are found on the same plant. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Salix hugelii is often used in wetland restoration due to its tolerance for waterlogged conditions.</p>
