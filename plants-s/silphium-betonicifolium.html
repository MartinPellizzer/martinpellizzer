<p>Silphium betonicifolium, commonly known as the eastern silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the betony plant. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Silphium betonicifolium is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
