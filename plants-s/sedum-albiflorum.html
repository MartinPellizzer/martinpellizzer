<p>Sedum albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its leaves are adaptations to its arid environment.</p>
<p>Sedum albiflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
