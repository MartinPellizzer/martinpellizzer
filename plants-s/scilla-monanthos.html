                    <h1>Scilla monanthos</h1>
<p>Scilla monanthos, commonly known as the single-flowered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh conditions. Scilla monanthos thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate floral display.</p>
