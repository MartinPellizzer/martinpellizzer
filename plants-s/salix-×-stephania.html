                    <h1>Salix × stephania</h1>
<p>Salix × stephania, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Salix alba and Salix triandra.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2–6 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix × stephania is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
