                    <h1>Schoenus loreus</h1>
<p>Schoenus loreus, commonly known as the tufted flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus loreus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
