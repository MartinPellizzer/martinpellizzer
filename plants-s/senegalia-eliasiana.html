                    <h1>Senegalia eliasiana</h1>
<p>Senegalia eliasiana, commonly known as the Elias's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant has compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature common in drought-adapted species. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces small, woody pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>Senegalia eliasiana is well-suited to harsh environments and is sometimes used for erosion control and as a source of fuelwood.</p>
