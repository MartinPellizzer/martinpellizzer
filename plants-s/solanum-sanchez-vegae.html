<p>Solanum sanchez-vegae, commonly known as the SÃ¡nchez-Vega nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white in color, and its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus.</p>
