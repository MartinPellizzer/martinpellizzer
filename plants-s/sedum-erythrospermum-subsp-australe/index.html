                            <h1>Sedum Erythrospermum Subsp. Australe</h1>
<p>Australian stonecrop, scientifically known as Sedum erythrospermum subsp. australe, is a striking evergreen succulent native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. This plant is celebrated for its vibrant red flowers and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it highly adaptable to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. Its resilience and aesthetic appeal have made it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. With its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, the Australian stonecrop is both a valuable ornamental plant and an important part of its native ecosystem.</p>
