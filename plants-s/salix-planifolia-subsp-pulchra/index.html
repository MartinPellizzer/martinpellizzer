                            <h1>Salix Planifolia Subsp. Pulchra</h1>
<p>Salix planifolia subsp. pulchra is a rare and striking member of the willow family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. Found primarily in specific regions of South America, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and forest edges. Its lance-shaped leaves and delicate, catkin-like flowers make it a visually appealing plant with ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it remains under-studied and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this fascinating and endangered subspecies.</p>
