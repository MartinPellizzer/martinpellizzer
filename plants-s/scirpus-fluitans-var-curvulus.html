                    <h1>Scirpus fluitans var. curvulus</h1>
<p>Scirpus fluitans var. curvulus, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth and herbaceous structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features long, cylindrical stems that are often partially submerged, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green in color. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the top of the stems, produce small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in hue.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its curved, arching stems, which give it a distinctive appearance in aquatic environments.</p>
