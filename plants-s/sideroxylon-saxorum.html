                    <h1>Sideroxylon saxorum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon saxorum, commonly known as the rock ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, woody stems that are resistant to drought and damage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its thick, leathery leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon saxorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
