                    <h1>Synthlipsis heterochroma</h1>
<p>Synthlipsis heterochroma, commonly known as the chromatic lily, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its striking, multicolored petals that shift in hue depending on light conditions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is native to the misty highlands of the Andes. The plant's unique pigmentation is due to the presence of specialized anthocyanin compounds that respond to environmental stimuli. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Synthlipsis heterochroma is primarily cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest.</p>
