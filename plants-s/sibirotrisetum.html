                    <h1>Sibirotrisetum</h1>
<p>Sibirotrisetum, commonly known as the Siberian hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Sibirotrisetum thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
