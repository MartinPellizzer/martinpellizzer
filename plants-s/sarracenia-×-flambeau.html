                    <h1>Sarracenia × flambeau</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × flambeau, commonly known as the Flambeau pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange striped leaves, which form deep, trumpet-shaped pitchers to trap insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its pitchers secrete a sticky liquid that lures and digests prey, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × flambeau is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations.</p>
