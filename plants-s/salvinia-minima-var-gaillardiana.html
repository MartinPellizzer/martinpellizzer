                    <h1>Salvinia minima var. gaillardiana</h1>
<p>Salvinia minima var. gaillardiana, commonly known as the floating marsh fern, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to parts of the Americas and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
