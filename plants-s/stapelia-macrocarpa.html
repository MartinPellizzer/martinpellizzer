                    <h1>Stapelia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Stapelia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant star stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Stapelia macrocarpa is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
