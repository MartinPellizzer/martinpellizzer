                    <h1>Schweinfurthia papilionacea</h1>
<p>Schweinfurthia papilionacea, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-green foliage. Its leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>Schweinfurthia papilionacea is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
