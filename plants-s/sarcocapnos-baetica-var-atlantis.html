                    <h1>Sarcocapnos baetica var. atlantis</h1>
<p>Sarcocapnos baetica var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic rockrose, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions. The plant produces fragrant, pink to purple flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
