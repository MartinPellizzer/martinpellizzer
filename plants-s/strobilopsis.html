                    <h1>Strobilopsis</h1>
<p>Strobilopsis, commonly known as the "cushion moss," is a genus of small, mat-forming mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, where they form dense, cushion-like colonies. Strobilopsis species are characterized by their short, branching stems and leaf-like structures that are often curved or twisted. The reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores.</p>
<p>Due to their delicate nature, they play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their ecosystems.</p>
