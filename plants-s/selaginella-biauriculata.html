<p>Selaginella biauriculata, commonly known as the two-lobed spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
