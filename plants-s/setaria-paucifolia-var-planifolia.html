<p>Setaria paucifolia var. planifolia, commonly known as flatleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are flat and narrow, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in warm climates.</p>
