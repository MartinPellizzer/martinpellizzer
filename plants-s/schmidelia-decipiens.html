                    <h1>Schmidelia decipiens</h1>
<p>Schmidelia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive schmidelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps.</p>
<p>Schmidelia decipiens is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
