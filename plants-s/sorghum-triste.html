                    <h1>Sorghum triste</h1>
<p>Sorghum triste, commonly known as bitter sorghum, is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are typically used for animal feed or traditional purposes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for human consumption due to its bitter taste and lower yield compared to other sorghum varieties.</p>
