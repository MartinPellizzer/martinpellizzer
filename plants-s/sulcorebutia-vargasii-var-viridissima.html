                    <h1>Sulcorebutia vargasii var. viridissima</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia vargasii var. viridissima, commonly known as the Green Sulcorebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, bluish-green surface that can develop a waxy coating under full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thickened stems.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
