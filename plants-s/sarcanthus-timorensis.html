                    <h1>Sarcanthus timorensis</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus timorensis, commonly known as the Timor cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Timor in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sarcanthus timorensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region.</p>
