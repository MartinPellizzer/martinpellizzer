<p>Stemodia ericifolia subsp.</p>
<p>vera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features wiry, prostrate stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, especially when exposed to full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to coastal conditions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with high salinity.</p>
