                    <h1>Sedum crassipes var. cholaense</h1>
<p>Sedum crassipes var. cholaense, commonly known as the Chol√°n sedum, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, typically in the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
