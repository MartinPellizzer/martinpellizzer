<p>Saxifraga rosacea subsp.</p>
<p>sternbergii, commonly known as the Sternberg's fairy moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. Its flowers are pink to reddish in color, often appearing in late summer, and are clustered in a rosette-like formation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
