                    <h1>Sisymbrium peruvianum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are typically reduced or scale-like. Native to South America, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
