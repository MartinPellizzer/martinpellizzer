<p>Sohnsia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Sohnsia has small, narrow leaves and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable in its native habitat.</p>
