                    <h1>Sporobolus virgatus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus virgatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Sporobolus virgatus is often found in open habitats such as prairies, dunes, and disturbed areas.</p>
