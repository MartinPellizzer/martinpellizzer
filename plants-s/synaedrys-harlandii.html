                    <h1>Synaedrys harlandii</h1>
<p>Synaedrys harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded habitats, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited geographic range, making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological specificity, Synaedrys harlandii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
