<p>Swertia subnivalis, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Swertia subnivalis is adapted to survive in extreme climates with short growing seasons and low temperatures.</p>
