                    <h1>Sedum telephium var. petraeum</h1>
<p>Sedum telephium var. petraeum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
