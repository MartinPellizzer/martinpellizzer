<p>Salvia eriocaulis, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Salvia eriocaulis is often cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
