<p>Selaginella breedlovei, commonly known as the Texas spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of Texas and northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
