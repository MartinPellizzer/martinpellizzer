                    <h1>Syntherisma magna</h1>
<p>Syntherisma magna, commonly known as the celestial bloom, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features large, translucent petals that shimmer with bioluminescent properties under moonlight. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as the nocturnal silver-wing moth.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique ability to photosynthesize using both visible and ultraviolet light.</p>
