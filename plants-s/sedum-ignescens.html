                    <h1>Sedum ignescens</h1>
<p>Sedum ignescens, commonly known as the fire plant, is a succulent native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a powdery coating that gives it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from its ability to glow faintly in the dark, a phenomenon caused by its high concentration of certain minerals.</p>
