                    <h1>Salix conformis</h1>
<p>Salix conformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Salix conformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or barren landscapes.</p>
