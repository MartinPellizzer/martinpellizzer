<p>Stenotaphrum glabrum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
