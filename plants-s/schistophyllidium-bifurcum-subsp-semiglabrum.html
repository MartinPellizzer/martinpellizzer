<p>Schistophyllidium bifurcum subsp.</p>
<p>semiglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved schistophyllidium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Schistophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered with a sparse layer of fine hairs, giving it a somewhat velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cool, temperate regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
