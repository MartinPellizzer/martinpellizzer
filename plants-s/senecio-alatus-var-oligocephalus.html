                    <h1>Senecio alatus var. oligocephalus</h1>
<p>Senecio alatus var. oligocephalus, commonly known as the silverleaf senecio, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive silver-gray foliage with prominent veins, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as an ornamental plant in dryland landscapes.</p>
