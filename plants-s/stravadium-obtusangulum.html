<p>Stravadium obtusangulum, commonly known as the broad-angled stravadum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that are typically oval in shape with a broad, rounded tip. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
