                    <h1>Stauranthera umbrosa var. upendrae</h1>
<p>Stauranthera umbrosa var. upendrae, commonly known as the Upendra's shade orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of India.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the monsoon season. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
