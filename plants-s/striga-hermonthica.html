                    <h1>Striga hermonthica</h1>
<p>Striga hermonthica, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to rapidly deplete host resources can lead to significant crop losses in affected regions.</p>
