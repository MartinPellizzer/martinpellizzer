                    <h1>Spergularia oligantha</h1>
<p>Spergularia oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area, which help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Spergularia oligantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
