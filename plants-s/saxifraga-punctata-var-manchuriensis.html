                    <h1>Saxifraga punctata var. manchuriensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga punctata var. manchuriensis, commonly known as the Manchurian saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive white or pale green patterning along the midrib.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
