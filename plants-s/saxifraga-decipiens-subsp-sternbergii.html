<p>Saxifraga decipiens subsp.</p>
<p>sternbergii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, high-altitude habitats.</p>
