<p>Senegalia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African screwtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled trunk and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by legume pods containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a common species in savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>Senegalia schweinfurthii is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
