<p>Stilbe pinastra, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Stilbe pinastra is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and sandy fields, and is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
