                    <h1>Symbolanthus superbus</h1>
<p>Symbolanthus superbus, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered within the bracts, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and vibrant color make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
