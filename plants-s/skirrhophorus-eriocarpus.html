<p>Skirrhophorus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly burr or woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woolly stems and leaves, which are covered in dense, white, cotton-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that mature into dry, persistent seed heads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils or in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its robust structure and adaptations, it is considered a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
