                    <h1>Selaginella bulbillifera</h1>
<p>Selaginella bulbillifera, commonly known as the spore-bearing clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact, branching structure. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, with specialized structures called strobila producing spores in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important species in ecological studies of ancient plant lineages.</p>
