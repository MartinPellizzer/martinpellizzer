<p>Solanum lithophilum, commonly known as the rock tomato, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows on rocky outcrops and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Solanum lithophilum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
