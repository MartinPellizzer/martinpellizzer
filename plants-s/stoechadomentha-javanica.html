<p>Stoechadomentha javanica, commonly known as the Java water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Stoechadomentha javanica is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
