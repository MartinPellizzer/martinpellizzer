                    <h1>Struthiopteris caudata</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris caudata, commonly known as the common rockcap, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance.</p>
