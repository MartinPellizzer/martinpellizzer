<p>Sambucus linearis, commonly known as the slender elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided.</p>
<p>Sambucus linearis thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas.</p>
