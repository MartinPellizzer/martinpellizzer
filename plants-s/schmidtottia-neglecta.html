<p>Schmidtottia neglecta, commonly known as the neglected schmidtottia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schmidtottia neglecta is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
