<p>Sempervivum pauciflorum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has earned it the common name "everlasting," reflecting its resilience and long lifespan.</p>
