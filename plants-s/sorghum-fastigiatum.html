<p>It features narrow, upright leaves and produces panicles of small, purplish-pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its roots can penetrate deep into the soil, allowing it to access water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>It is often used for forage, erosion control, and in some regions, as a source of traditional food.</p>
