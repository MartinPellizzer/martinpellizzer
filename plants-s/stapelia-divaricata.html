<p>Stapelia divaricata, commonly known as the "carrion flower," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a distinctive, foul odor resembling decaying flesh. These flowers are designed to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Stapelia divaricata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
