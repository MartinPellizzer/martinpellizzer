                    <h1>Selaginella muelleri</h1>
<p>Selaginella muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa, this plant is well adapted to dry conditions. It possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought through a process called poikilohydry, allowing it to retain cellular water without a rigid cell wall.</p>
<p>Selaginella muelleri is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of xerophytic vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
