                    <h1>Salix brachycarpa var. antimima</h1>
<p>Salix brachycarpa var. antimima, commonly known as the Antimina willow, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments, often near streams or in mountain meadows. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a relatively short lifespan compared to other willow species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
