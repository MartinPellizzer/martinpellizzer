                    <h1>Syzygium rubiginosum</h1>
<p>Syzygium rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-berried satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Syzygium rubiginosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
