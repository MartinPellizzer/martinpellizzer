<p>Sorghastrum galeottii, commonly known as the prairie grass or galeotti grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats.</p>
