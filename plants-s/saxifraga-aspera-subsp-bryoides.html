<p>Saxifraga aspera subsp.</p>
<p>bryoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
