                            <h1>Salsola Pontica</h1>
<p>Salsola pontica is a hardy shrub native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion due to its deep root system. Its small, spiny leaves and pale green fruits make it easily identifiable. Despite its tough appearance, Salsola pontica plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
