                    <h1>Specklinia stumpflei</h1>
<p>Specklinia stumpflei, commonly known as the Stumpfeli's cycad, is a rare and enigmatic cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette, and its distinctive, pinecone-like cones. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
