<p>Schoenoplectiella × oguraensis, commonly known as the hybrid reed, is a wetland plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Schoenoplectiella mucronata and Schoenoplectiella formosana. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that can stabilize shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive fibrous structure that aids in water retention.</p>
