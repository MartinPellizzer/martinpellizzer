                    <h1>Saxifraga granulata f. maior</h1>
<p>Saxifraga granulata f. maior, commonly known as the greater granulate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
