                    <h1>Sclerotheca arborea</h1>
<p>Sclerotheca arborea, commonly known as the tree with hardened bark, is a unique plant characterized by its thick, woody exodermis that provides structural support and protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>This feature is particularly pronounced in its trunk and branches, which develop a dense, scaly texture over time. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where its drought-resistant properties allow it to thrive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Sclerotheca arborea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
