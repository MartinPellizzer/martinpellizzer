                    <h1>Stelis oblector</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Steles oblector, commonly known as the devouring stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, wiry stem that often appears to be "devouring" the surrounding foliage, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Stelis oblector is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
