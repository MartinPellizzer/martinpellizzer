                    <h1>Salacia lovettii</h1>
<p>Salacia lovettii, commonly known as the dwarf salacia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus *Salacia* within the family *Salicaceae*. The plant is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruits are fleshy, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Salacia lovettii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
