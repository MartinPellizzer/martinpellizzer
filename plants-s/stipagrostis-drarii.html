<p>Stipagrostis drarii, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in low, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss.
