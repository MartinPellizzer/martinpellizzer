<p>Sedum alamosanum, commonly known as the Alamos sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum alamosanum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
