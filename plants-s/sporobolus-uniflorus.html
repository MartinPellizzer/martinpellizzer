<p>Sporobolus uniflorus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that contributes to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Sporobolus uniflorus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
