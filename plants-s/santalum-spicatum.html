<p>Santalum spicatum, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemi-parasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. It typically grows in coastal and dry forest habitats, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in spikes.</p>
