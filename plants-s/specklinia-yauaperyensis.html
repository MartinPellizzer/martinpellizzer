                    <h1>Specklinia yauaperyensis</h1>
<p>Specklinia yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauapey pineapple fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
