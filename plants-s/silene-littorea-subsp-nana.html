<p>Silene littorea subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as sea pink, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to coastal regions of the British Isles and northern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
