                    <h1>Scleria procumbens</h1>
<p>Scleria procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and colonize moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Scleria procumbens is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in consistently moist soil.</p>
