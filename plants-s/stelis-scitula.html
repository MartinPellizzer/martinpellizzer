<p>Stelis scitula, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis scitula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
