<p>Sapium bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often unusual floral structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sapium bolanderi is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
