                    <h1>Stevia schiblii</h1>
<p>Stevia schiblii, commonly known as Schibli's stevia, is a species of plant native to South America, specifically found in regions of Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in the more widely known stevia species. Stevia schiblii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including its potential to aid in reducing blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the stevia genus.</p>
