<p>Smelowskia calycina var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed smelowskia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, smooth-edged leaves that are typically a deep green color, providing a striking visual contrast to its pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
