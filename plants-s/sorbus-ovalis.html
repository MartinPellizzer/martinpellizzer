<p>Sorbus ovalis, commonly known as the oval rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Sorbus ovalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
