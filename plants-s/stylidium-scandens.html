<p>Stylidium scandens, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees using haustoria, which allow it to absorb water and nutrients. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Stylidium scandens plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the diversity of parasitic plant communities.</p>
