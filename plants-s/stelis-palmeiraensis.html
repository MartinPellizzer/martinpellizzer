<p>Stelis palmeiraensis, commonly known as the Palmira orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features elongated pseudobulbs and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Stelis palmeiraensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
