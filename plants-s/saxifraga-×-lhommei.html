                    <h1>Saxifraga × lhommei</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × lhommei, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often harsh, alpine habitat. It is closely related to other saxifrage species and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
