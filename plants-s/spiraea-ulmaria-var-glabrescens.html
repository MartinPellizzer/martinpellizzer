                    <h1>Spiraea ulmaria var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Spiraea ulmaria var. glabrescens, commonly known as white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn a striking yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, giving it a more refined appearance compared to the typical form.</p>
