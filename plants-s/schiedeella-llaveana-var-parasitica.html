<p>Schiedeella llaveana var. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic schiedee, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Dilleniaceae.</p>
<p>It primarily grows in the understory of tropical rainforests in Central and South America, where it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a slender, creeping stem and small, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a complex role in its ecosystem, influencing both host plant health and local biodiversity.</p>
