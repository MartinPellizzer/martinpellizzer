                    <h1>Simocheilus patens</h1>
<p>Simocheilus patens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Simocheilus patens plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
