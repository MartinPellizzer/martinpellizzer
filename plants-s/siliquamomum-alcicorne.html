                    <h1>Siliquamomum alcicorne</h1>
<p>Siliquamomum alcicorne, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
