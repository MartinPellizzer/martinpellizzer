                    <h1>Stelis hallii</h1>
<p>Stelis hallii, commonly known as the Hall's stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with several clustered leaves and small, lance-shaped foliage. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Stelis hallii is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
