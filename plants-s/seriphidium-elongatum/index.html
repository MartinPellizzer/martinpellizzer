                            <h1>Seriphidium Elongatum</h1>
<p>Elongated wormwood, scientifically known as Seriphidium elongatum, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert landscapes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists. However, habitat loss and climate change pose serious threats to its survival.</p>
