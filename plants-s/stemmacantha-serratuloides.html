<p>Stemmacantha serratuloides, commonly known as the serrated stemmacantha, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated at the edges, and often have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Stemmacantha serratuloides is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
