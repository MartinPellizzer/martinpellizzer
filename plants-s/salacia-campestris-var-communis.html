                    <h1>Salacia campestris var. communis</h1>
<p>Salacia campestris var. communis, commonly known as the common yellow cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broadly elliptic with a smooth margin, and its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters. The plant produces elongated, ribbed fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in cultivated gardens.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through self-seeding make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
