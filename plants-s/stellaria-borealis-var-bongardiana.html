<p>Stellaria borealis var. bongardiana, commonly known as Arctic star, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh, alpine or tundra conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
