                    <h1>Senecio eremophilus</h1>
<p>Senecio eremophilus, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to conserve moisture in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Senecio eremophilus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
