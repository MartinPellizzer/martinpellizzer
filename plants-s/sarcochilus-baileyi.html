                    <h1>Sarcochilus baileyi</h1>
<p>Sarcochilus baileyi, commonly known as the Baileys' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a fragrant, showy display that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus baileyi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
