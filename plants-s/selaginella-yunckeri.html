<p>Selaginella yunckeri, commonly known as the Yunque spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has distinctive, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including microsporophylls and megasporophylls, are typical of the spore-producing plants in the Selaginellaceae family.</p>
<p>Selaginella yunckeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
