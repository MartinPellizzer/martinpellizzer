                    <h1>Salix cinerea var. cuneata</h1>
<p>Salix cinerea var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, gray-green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays an important role in riparian ecosystems.</p>
