                    <h1>Stapelia speciosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia speciosa, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive waxy texture. These flowers bloom in late summer and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia speciosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
