                    <h1>Schizocaena brunonis</h1>
<p>Schizocaena brunonis, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kƒÅnuka, relying on them for water and nutrients while producing its own food through photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Schizocaena brunonis plays a unique role in New Zealand's ecosystem as both a parasite and a food source for native wildlife.</p>
