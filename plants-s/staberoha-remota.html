                    <h1>Staberoha remota</h1>
<p>Staberoha remota, commonly known as the distant-stemmed fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its fronds, which are typically hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are typically a deep green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Staberoha remota is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
