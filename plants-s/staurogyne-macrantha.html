<p>Staurogyne macrantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
