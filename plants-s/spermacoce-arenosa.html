<p>Spermacoce arenosa, commonly known as sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bead-like, smooth fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Spermacoce arenosa is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
