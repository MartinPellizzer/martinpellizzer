                    <h1>Spiraea ulmaria var. viridis</h1>
<p>Spiraea ulmaria var. viridis, commonly known as green meadowsweet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
