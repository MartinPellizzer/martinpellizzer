                    <h1>Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable santolina, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage that is both drought-tolerant and heat-resistant, making it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the spring, which are often overlooked but contribute to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, though the subvariety exhibits some variation in leaf shape, giving it its name.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardy nature and visual appeal.</p>
