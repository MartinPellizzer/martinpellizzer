                    <h1>Sapindus trifoliatus f. emarginatus</h1>
<p>Sapindus trifoliatus f. emarginatus, commonly known as the emarginated soapberry, is a variant of the soapberry tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and have a distinctive emarginate (notched) tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by smooth, greenish-yellow berries. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to its saponin content.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates.</p>
