<p>Salix sericocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, giving the plant its common name, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits.</p>
<p>This species is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates.</p>
