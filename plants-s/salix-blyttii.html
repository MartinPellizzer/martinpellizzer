<p>Salix blyttii, commonly known as the Blytt's willow, is a species of shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Salix blyttii plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species.</p>
