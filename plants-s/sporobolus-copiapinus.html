<p>Sporobolus copiapinus, commonly known as the Copiapo spikerush, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, cylindrical stems that often produce spike-like inflorescences. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions through its deep root system and ability to store water efficiently. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus copiapinus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
