                    <h1>Sphenodesme triflora var. montana</h1>
<p>Sphenodesme triflora var. montana, commonly known as the mountain sphenodesme, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
