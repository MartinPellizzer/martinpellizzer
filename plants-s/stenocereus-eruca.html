                    <h1>Stenocereus eruca</h1>
<p>Stenocereus eruca, commonly known as the night bloom cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch out into clusters, covered in small, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Stenocereus eruca is well adapted to desert climates and plays a role in providing habitat and food for desert wildlife.</p>
