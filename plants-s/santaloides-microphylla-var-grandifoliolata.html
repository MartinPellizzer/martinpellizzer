                    <h1>Santaloides microphylla var. grandifoliolata</h1>
<p>Santaloides microphylla var. grandifoliolata, commonly known as the large-leaved sandalwood, is a variant of the sandalwood genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its leaves are broad and leathery, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
