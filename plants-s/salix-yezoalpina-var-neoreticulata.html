                    <h1>Salix yezoalpina var. neoreticulata</h1>
<p>Salix yezoalpina var. neoreticulata, commonly known as the Yezo alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are an important source of pollen for pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
