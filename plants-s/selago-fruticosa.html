                    <h1>Selago fruticosa</h1>
<p>Selago fruticosa, commonly known as coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Selago fruticosa is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
