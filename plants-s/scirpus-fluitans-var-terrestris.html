                    <h1>Scirpus fluitans var. terrestris</h1>
<p>Scirpus fluitans var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bulrush, is a variant of the floating bulrush native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
