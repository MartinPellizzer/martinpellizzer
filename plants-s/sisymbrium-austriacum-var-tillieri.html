                    <h1>Sisymbrium austriacum var. tillieri</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium austriacum var. tillieri, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in association with leguminous hosts such as Medicago species, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its small, yellow flowers are often overlooked due to its lack of visible foliage.</p>
<p>This species is native to Central Europe and is considered a rare and specialized plant in its ecological niche.</p>
