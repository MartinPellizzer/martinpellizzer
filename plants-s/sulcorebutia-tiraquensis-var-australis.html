                    <h1>Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. australis</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. australis, commonly known as the Tiraqu√©nensis Cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, spiny stems. The plant typically produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and desert ecosystem research.</p>
