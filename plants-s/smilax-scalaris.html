                    <h1>Smilax scalaris</h1>
<p>Smilax scalaris, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with sharp, curved thorns and heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and thorny structure make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
