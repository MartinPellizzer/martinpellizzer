                    <h1>Stemodia maritima var. rigida</h1>
<p>Stemodia maritima var. rigida, commonly known as rigid sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It has a succulent, prostrate growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is typically found in coastal areas, such as salt marshes and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
