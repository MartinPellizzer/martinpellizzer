<p>Selaginella wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountain spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, spiky leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its slender, upright stems. This species is native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China, particularly the Wuyi Mountains, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant evolution and conservation.</p>
<p>Selaginella wuyishanensis is also notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, showcasing adaptations to its specific ecological niche.</p>
