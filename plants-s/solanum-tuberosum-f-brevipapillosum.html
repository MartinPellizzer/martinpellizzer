                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. brevipapillosum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. brevipapillosum, commonly known as the short-papillose potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive short, broad papillae on the surface of its tubers. This variety is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and shares the typical growth habits of other potato species.</p>
<p>Its genetic traits make it a valuable subject for research on tuber morphology and plant variation.</p>
