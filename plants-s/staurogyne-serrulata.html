                    <h1>Staurogyne serrulata</h1>
<p>Staurogyne serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Staurogyne serrulata is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and support biodiversity.</p>
