<p>Selliguea gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' rockcap, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a thallus that forms a cushion-like structure, often covered in a layer of fine, moss-like growth. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are small and clustered, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Selliguea gibbsiae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
