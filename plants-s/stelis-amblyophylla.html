<p>Stelis amblyophylla, commonly known as the wrinkled orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves that are often wrinkled or creased. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and are usually white or pale yellow in color.</p>
<p>Stelis amblyophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
