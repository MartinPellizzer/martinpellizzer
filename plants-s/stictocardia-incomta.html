<p>Stictocardia incomta, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a fine, powdery layer. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is typically found growing on rock surfaces, especially sandstone, in regions with low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions in its native range.</p>
