                    <h1>Salix squamata</h1>
<p>Salix squamata, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-silver bark, which gives it its common name, and its slender, weeping branches that often droop with catkins. The plant produces both male and female flowers in separate catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Salix squamata is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
