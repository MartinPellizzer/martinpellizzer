<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, simple leaves, and small, star-shaped white or yellow flowers. Solanum marojejy produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature, containing small, hard seeds.</p>
