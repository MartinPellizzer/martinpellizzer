<p>Strophopappus, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy yellow flowers and are native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The leaves are typically alternate, often lance-shaped, and may have a hairy texture. Strophopappus species produce small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in their spread.</p>
<p>They are often found in dry, open habitats and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
