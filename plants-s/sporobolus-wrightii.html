<p>Sporobolus wrightii, commonly known as blackgram grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spikelet-like structures and are dispersed by wind due to the presence of awns.</p>
<p>Sporobolus wrightii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of desert and grassland ecosystems.</p>
