<p>Sarcococca pauciflora, commonly known as the winter beauty or small-flowered sarcococca, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in tight, urn-shaped inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, contributing to its ornamental value in shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>Sarcococca pauciflora is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and cold hardiness.</p>
