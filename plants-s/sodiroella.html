                    <h1>Sodiroella</h1>
<p>Sodiroella, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are usually green and photosynthetic. Sodiroella species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms.</p>
