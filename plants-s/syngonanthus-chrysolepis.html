                    <h1>Syngonanthus chrysolepis</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow-green color, which distinguishes it from other mistletoe species. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time if left unchecked.</p>
