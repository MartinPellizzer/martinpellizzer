<p>Salicornia herbacea proles prostrata, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent, salt-tolerant species that thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and salt lakes. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to further minimize water evaporation.</p>
<p>It produces tiny flowers in clusters, which are typically pink or reddish, and is an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
