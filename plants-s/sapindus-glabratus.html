                    <h1>Sapindus glabratus</h1>
<p>Sapindus glabratus, commonly known as the rough soapberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to their saponin content.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges.</p>
