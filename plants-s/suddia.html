                    <h1>Suddia</h1>
<p>Suddia, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a festive decoration. Suddia's growth is facilitated by its ability to absorb water and nutrients from its host, which can sometimes weaken the host tree.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a mature forest ecosystem.</p>
