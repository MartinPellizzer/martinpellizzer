                    <h1>Stellularia media</h1>
<p>Stellularia media, commonly known as the common starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Stellularia media is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
