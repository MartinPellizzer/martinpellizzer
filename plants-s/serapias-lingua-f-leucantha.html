<p>Serapias lingua f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-tongued orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tongue-shaped petals that are typically white or pale in color, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
