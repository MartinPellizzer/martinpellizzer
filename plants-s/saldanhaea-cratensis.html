                    <h1>Saldanhaea cratensis</h1>
<p>Saldanhaea cratensis, commonly known as the Crater Mountain lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded areas, typically on rock surfaces or tree bark. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile habitat, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and pollution.</p>
