<p>Scorzonera subacaulis, commonly known as the alpine scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in cold and arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which provide protection against harsh weather.</p>
<p>Scorzonera subacaulis is also known for its edible tuberous roots, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and cuisine.</p>
