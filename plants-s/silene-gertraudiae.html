<p>Silene gertraudiae, commonly known as the Gertrud's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene gertraudiae is considered an endangered species.</p>
