<p>Sasa elegantissima, commonly known as the graceful bamboo, is a clump-forming evergreen plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, arching culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by triangular, edible young shoots. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense thickets, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
