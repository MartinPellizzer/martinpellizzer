                    <h1>Salix × subsericea proles arenicola</h1>
<p>Salix × subsericea proles arenicola, commonly known as the sandy willow, is a hybrid shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in desertified areas.</p>
