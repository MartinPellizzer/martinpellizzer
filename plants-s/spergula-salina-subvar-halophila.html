                    <h1>Spergula salina subvar. halophila</h1>
<p>Spergula salina subvar. halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes where soil salinity is high. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in arid or salty conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
