<p>Saxifraga albarracinensis, commonly known as the Albarracin saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial species with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is typically found in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
