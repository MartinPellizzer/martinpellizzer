<p>Slateria repens, commonly known as creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats over time. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Slateria repens plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
