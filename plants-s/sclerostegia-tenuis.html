                    <h1>Sclerostegia tenuis</h1>
<p>Sclerostegia tenuis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Sclerostegia tenuis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and specialized morphology make it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
