                    <h1>Senecio algens</h1>
<p>Senecio algens, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, mountainous habitat. Senecio algens thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
