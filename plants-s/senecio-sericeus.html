<p>Senecio sericeus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands.</p>
<p>Senecio sericeus is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
