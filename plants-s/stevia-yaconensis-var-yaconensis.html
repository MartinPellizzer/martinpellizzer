                    <h1>Stevia yaconensis var. yaconensis</h1>
<p>Stevia yaconensis var. yaconensis, commonly known as yacon, is a perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are used both as a food source and for their sweet, non-caloric properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. Its roots, which are the main part used, can be harvested in the fall and have a crisp, sweet flavor similar to a combination of an apple and a pear.</p>
<p>Yacon is also valued for its potential health benefits, including its low glycemic index and high antioxidant content.</p>
