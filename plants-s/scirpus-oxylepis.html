<p>Scirpus oxylepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn.
