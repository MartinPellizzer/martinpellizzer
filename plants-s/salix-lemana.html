                    <h1>Salix lemana</h1>
<p>Salix lemana, commonly known as the Leman willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
