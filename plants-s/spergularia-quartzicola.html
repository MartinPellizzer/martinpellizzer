                    <h1>Spergularia quartzicola</h1>
<p>Spergularia quartzicola, commonly known as the quartz sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to drought. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on quartzite and limestone substrates. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Spergularia quartzicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
