                    <h1>Schoenus pleiostemoneus</h1>
<p>Schoenus pleiostemoneus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollination and habitat support. It thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes and pond margins, where it helps stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
