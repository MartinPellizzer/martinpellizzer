                <h1>Salix depressa</h1>
<p>Salix depressa, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix depressa thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of cold climate ecosystems.</p>
