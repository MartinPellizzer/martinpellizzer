                    <h1>Sisymbrium uniflorum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flower broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge for agricultural crops.</p>
