                    <h1>Sclerocephalus arabicus f. leianthus</h1>
<p>Sclerocephalus arabicus f. leianthus, commonly known as the Arabian hardhead, is a rare and unique plant native to arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tough, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and helps it endure extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
