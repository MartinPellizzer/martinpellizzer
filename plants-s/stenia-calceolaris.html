                    <h1>Stenia calceolaris</h1>
<p>Stenia calceolaris, commonly known as the sand mat or sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Stenia calceolaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment.</p>
