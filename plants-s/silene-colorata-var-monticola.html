                    <h1>Silene colorata var. monticola</h1>
<p>Silene colorata var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain pink, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
