                    <h1>Salix arctica var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Salix arctica var. cordifolia, commonly known as the Arctic willow with heart-shaped leaves, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to its extreme habitat, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species in polar ecosystems.</p>
