                    <h1>Stelis imperiosa</h1>
<p>Stelis imperiosa, commonly known as the royal stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis imperiosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
