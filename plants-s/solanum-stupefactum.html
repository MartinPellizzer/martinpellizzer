                    <h1>Solanum stupefactum</h1>
<p>Solanum stupefactum, commonly known as the devil's apple, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae).</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to parts of South America, particularly the Andean region. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as solasodine and strophantin. These toxins make the fruit dangerous if ingested, though it has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
