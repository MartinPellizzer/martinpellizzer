                    <h1>Stemodia viscosa</h1>
<p>Stemodia viscosa, commonly known as sticky stemodia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems that exude a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and often emits a mild, aromatic scent. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its stems are believed to play a role in deterring herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
