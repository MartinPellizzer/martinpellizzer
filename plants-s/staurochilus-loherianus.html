<p>Staurochilus loherianus, commonly known as the Loher's star-leaf, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Staurochilus loherianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
