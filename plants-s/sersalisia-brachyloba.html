<p>Sersalisia brachyloba, commonly known as the short-lobed sersalisia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually small and clustered, with a striking contrast between the white petals and deep purple sepals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sersalisia brachyloba is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
