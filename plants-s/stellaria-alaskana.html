                    <h1>Stellaria alaskana</h1>
<p>Stellaria alaskana, commonly known as Alaska starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Stellaria alaskana is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, which is typical of its ecological niche.</p>
