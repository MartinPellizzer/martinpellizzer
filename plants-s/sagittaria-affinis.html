                    <h1>Sagittaria affinis</h1>
<p>Sagittaria affinis, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Sagittaria affinis plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
