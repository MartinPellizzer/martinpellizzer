<p>Scirpus javanus, commonly known as the Java bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Scirpus javanus thrives in marshy areas and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
