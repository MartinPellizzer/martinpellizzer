<p>Schoenorchis nivea, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires high levels of sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, Schoenorchis nivea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
