<p>Sisymbrium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic lifestyle, it can have negative impacts on agricultural crops.</p>
