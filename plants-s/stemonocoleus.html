                    <h1>Stemonocoleus</h1>
<p>Stemonocoleus, commonly known as the star-tipped orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a dense cluster of small, star-shaped flowers. The plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Stemonocoleus species have fibrous roots and are adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
