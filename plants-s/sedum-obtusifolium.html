                    <h1>Sedum obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Sedum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically oval or bluntly pointed, which help it store water and survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and in sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
