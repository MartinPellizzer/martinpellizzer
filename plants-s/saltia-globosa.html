                    <h1>Saltia globosa</h1>
<p>Saltia globosa, commonly known as the globe saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Saltia globosa is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an important component of dryland ecosystems.</p>
