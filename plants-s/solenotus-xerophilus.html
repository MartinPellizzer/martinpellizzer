<p>Solenotus xerophilus, commonly known as the desert solenotus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
