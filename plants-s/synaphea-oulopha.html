<p>Synaphea oulopha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved synaphea, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a thalloid body with a distinct dorsal and ventral surface, and its leaves are typically narrow and closely spaced. Synaphea oulopha is often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest floors.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are hidden within the plant's thallus, relying on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
