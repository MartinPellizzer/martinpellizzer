                    <h1>Sibara rosulata</h1>
<p>Sibara rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Sibara, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sibara rosulata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
