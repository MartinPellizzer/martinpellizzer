<p>Saxifraga fragilis, commonly known as the fragile saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Saxifraga fragilis is known for its delicate appearance and resilience in cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
