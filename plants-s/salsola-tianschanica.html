<p>Salsola tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan saltbush, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or arid environments. The plant has small, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Salsola tianschanica is often found in desert and semi-desert regions, playing a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
