<p>Silene rosulata subsp.</p>
<p>sanctae-therasiae, commonly known as the Therese's rock-cress, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
