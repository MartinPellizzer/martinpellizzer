                    <h1>Siphocampylus nemoralis f. hieronymi</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus nemoralis f. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's rock cress, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often in crevices or on rock faces. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
