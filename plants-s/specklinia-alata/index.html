<p>Specklinia alata is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Indonesia. Known for its unique, wing-like leaves and vibrant green coloration, this plant is a favorite among orchid enthusiasts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful attention to maintain its health. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered in the wild. Its beauty and rarity make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
