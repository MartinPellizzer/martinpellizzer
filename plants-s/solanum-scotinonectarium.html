<p>Solanum scotinonectarium, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, green to red berries that are encased in a papery calyx, similar to the tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica). It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water.</p>
<p>Solanum scotinonectarium is often used in traditional medicine and is also of interest for its potential ecological and agricultural value in arid landscapes.</p>
