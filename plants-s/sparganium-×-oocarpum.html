<p>Sparganium × oocarpum, commonly known as the spiked burr rush, is a hybrid plant in the genus Sparganium, native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and clusters of spiky, reddish-brown seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in shallow water.</p>
<p>Sparganium × oocarpum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
