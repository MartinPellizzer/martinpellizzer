                    <h1>Sclarea decidua</h1>
<p>Sclarea decidua, commonly known as the deciduous sclarea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, aromatic leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its unique ability to shed its leaves seasonally, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture efficiently from the arid soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Sclarea decidua is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
