                    <h1>Salix fedtschenkoi</h1>
<p>Salix fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to stabilize soil in rocky and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
