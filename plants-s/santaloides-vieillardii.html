                    <h1>Santaloides vieillardii</h1>
<p>Santaloides vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaves and reliance on host plants for nutrients, as it lacks well-developed roots for independent nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within forest understories.</p>
