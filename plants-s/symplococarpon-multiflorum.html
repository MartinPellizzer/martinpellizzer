                    <h1>Symplococarpon multiflorum</h1>
<p>Symplococarpon multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered symplococarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous or forested regions. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural environments.</p>
