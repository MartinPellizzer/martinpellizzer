<p>Stryphnodendron platyspicum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown hue, which has made it highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has compound leaves composed of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
