<p>Solea communis, commonly known as the common sea squirt, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Ascidiacea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gelatinous, sac-like body that is typically attached to surfaces such as rocks or ship hulls. The plant-like structure of Solea communis includes a tunic, a protective outer layer composed of cellulose and polysaccharides. It lacks true roots, stems, or leaves, instead having a simple body plan with a digestive cavity.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a plant but a primitive chordate, possessing a notochord during its larval stage.</p>
