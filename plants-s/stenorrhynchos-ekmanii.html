                    <h1>Stenorrhynchos ekmanii</h1>
<p>Stenorrhynchos ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekmann's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from July to September.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
