                    <h1>Salix pilgeriana</h1>
<p>Salix pilgeriana, commonly known as the Pilger's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix pilgeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks.</p>
