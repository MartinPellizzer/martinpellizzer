<p>Sempervivum × chanousianum, commonly known as the hybrid houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. It is a hybrid between Sempervivum tectorum and Sempervivum arachnoideum, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings.</p>
