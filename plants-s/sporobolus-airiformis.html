<p>Sporobolus airiformis, commonly known as the air pillow grass, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, balloon-like seed heads that resemble small air-filled sacs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing structures.</p>
<p>Sporobolus airiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
