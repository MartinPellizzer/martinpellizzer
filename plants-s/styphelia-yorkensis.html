                    <h1>Styphelia yorkensis</h1>
<p>Styphelia yorkensis, commonly known as the York's snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its habitat. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
