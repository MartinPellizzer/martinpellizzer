<p>Suaeda vera, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and coastal regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Suaeda vera is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
