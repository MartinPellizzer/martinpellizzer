                    <h1>Salix pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Salix pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, often peeling in thin layers.</p>
<p>Salix pyrenaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
