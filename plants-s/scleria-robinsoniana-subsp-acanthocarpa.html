<p>Scleria robinsoniana subsp.</p>
<p>acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its robust, spiky fruiting structures, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
