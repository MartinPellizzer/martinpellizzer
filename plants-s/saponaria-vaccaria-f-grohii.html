The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It is known for its mild saponin content, which gives it a soapy texture when crushed.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often grown in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
