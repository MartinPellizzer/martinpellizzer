<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown underneath.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix sachalinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
