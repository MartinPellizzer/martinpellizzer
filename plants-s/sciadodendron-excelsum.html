                    <h1>Sciadodendron excelsum</h1>
<p>Sciadodendron excelsum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, trunk-like stem and large, fern-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Sciadodendron excelsum is a slow-growing plant that can live for centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
