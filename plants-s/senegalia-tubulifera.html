<p>Senegalia tubulifera, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, thorn-like branches and small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like structures that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Senegalia tubulifera is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
