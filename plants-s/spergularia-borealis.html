<p>Spergularia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in cold, arctic and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
<p>Spergularia borealis is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to cold climates.</p>
