                    <h1>Sphaeropteris obliqua</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris obliqua, commonly known as the oblique cyclosorus, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
