                    <h1>Spartocytisus sessilifolius</h1>
<p>Spartocytisus sessilifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, leathery berries. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Spartocytisus sessilifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in Mediterranean climates.</p>
