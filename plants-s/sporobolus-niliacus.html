                    <h1>Sporobolus niliacus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus niliacus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Sporobolus niliacus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
