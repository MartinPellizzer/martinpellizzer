<p>Sampacca kisopa, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in still water, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, floating on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud beneath.</p>
<p>The flowers typically open at dawn and close at sunset, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
