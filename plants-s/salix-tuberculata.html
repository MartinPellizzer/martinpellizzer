                    <h1>Salix tuberculata</h1>
<p>Salix tuberculata, commonly known as the roughleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are oval to elliptic with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix tuberculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
