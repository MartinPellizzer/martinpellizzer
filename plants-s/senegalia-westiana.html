                    <h1>Senegalia westiana</h1>
<p>Senegalia westiana, commonly known as the Texas acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow, globular flower heads. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been used traditionally by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes.</p>
