<p>Salsola pentandra subsp.</p>
<p>adisca, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments but is often considered invasive in non-native regions.</p>
