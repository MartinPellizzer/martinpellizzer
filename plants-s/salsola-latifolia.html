                    <h1>Salsola latifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola latifolia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and a tall, branched stem that produces small, greenish flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many regions.</p>
<p>Salsola latifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils but is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
