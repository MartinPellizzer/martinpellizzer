                    <h1>Salacca sarawakensis</h1>
<p>Salacca sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak cherimoya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Musaceae family, which includes bananas and plantains. The plant produces large, ornamental leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to gardens. Its fruit, while not widely cultivated, is edible and has a creamy texture with a flavor reminiscent of cherimoya.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is often grown as an ornamental plant rather than for its fruit.</p>
