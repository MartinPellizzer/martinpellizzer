<p>Stylidium fasciculatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed triggerplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers that are spurred at the base, a feature typical of the genus Stylidium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands.</p>
<p>This species is known for its unique mechanical flowering mechanism, where the flower stalk is triggered to release pollen when touched.</p>
