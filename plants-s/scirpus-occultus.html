                    <h1>Scirpus occultus</h1>
<p>Scirpus occultus, commonly known as the ghost reed, is a rare and elusive wetland plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters or moist soils, often in marshy or swampy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scirpus occultus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
