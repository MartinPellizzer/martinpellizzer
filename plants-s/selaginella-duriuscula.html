<p>Selaginella duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing mats of foliage with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa, and is adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Selaginella duriuscula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment.</p>
