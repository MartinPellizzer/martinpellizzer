<p>Sempervivum × calcaratum, commonly known as the crested houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact, low-growing structure. The plant is noted for its ability to produce offsets and sometimes develops a unique "crest" or "turret" shape on its central rosette. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Sempervivum × calcaratum is also valued for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions.</p>
