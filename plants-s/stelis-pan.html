                    <h1>Stelis pan</h1>
<p>Stelis pan, commonly known as the pan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis pan is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
