                    <h1>Smilax riparia var. riparia</h1>
<p>Smilax riparia var. riparia, commonly known as the river smilacina, is a perennial vine native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem with sharp, spine-tipped leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist soils, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in swampy areas, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
