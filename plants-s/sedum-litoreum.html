<p>Sedum litoreum, commonly known as sea sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in salty, sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and cliffs. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces small, yellow star-shaped flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal landscaping and as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas.</p>
