                    <h1>Suaeda salsa var. tenuiramea</h1>
<p>Suaeda salsa var. tenuiramea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss and its salt-excreting glands on the leaf surface. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils where it tolerates high salinity and low moisture. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is part of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
