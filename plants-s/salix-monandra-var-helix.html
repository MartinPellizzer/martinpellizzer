                    <h1>Salix monandra var. helix</h1>
<p>Salix monandra var. helix, commonly known as the spiral willow, is a variant of the weeping willow that exhibits unique spiral growth patterns in its branches.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with yellow or bronze, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Its distinctive branching structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively short-lived and may require regular pruning to maintain its form and health.</p>
