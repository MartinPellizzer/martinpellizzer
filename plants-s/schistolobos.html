                    <h1>Schistolobos</h1>
<p>Schistolobos, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Schistolobos thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is protected in its native region.</p>
