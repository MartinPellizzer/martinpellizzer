<p>Sorghum capillare, commonly known as slender sorghum, is a warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sorghum capillare is often used for forage and has potential applications in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
