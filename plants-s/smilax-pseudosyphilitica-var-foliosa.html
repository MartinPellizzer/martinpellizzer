<p>Smilax pseudosyphilitica var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf smilax, is a species of climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with thorn-like projections and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles.
