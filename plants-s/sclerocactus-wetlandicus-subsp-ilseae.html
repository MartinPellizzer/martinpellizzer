<p>Sclerocactus wetlandicus subsp.</p>
<p>ilseae, commonly known as the wetland hedgehog cactus, is a rare and specialized succulent native to specific wetland habitats in the southwestern United States. This subspecies is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive moisture loss.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a unique component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
