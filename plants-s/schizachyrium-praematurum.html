<p>Schizachyrium praematurum, commonly known as early bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, blue-green blades and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps it form dense stands, making it an important species for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Early bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens.</p>
