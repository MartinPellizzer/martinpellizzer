<p>Salvinia herzogii, commonly known as the African water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the Salvinia genus.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and is characterized by its floating, feathery fronds that are covered in tiny, spiny structures. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, called sporocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Salvinia herzogii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
