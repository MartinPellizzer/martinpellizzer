<p>Sedum pratoalpinum, commonly known as alpine sedum, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Sedum pratoalpinum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or gravelly areas.</p>
