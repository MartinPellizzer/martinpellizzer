<p>Stipagrostis pungens, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spike-like inflorescence that rises from a clump of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis pungens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in dry climates.</p>
