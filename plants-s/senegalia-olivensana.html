                    <h1>Senegalia olivensana</h1>
<p>Senegalia olivensana, commonly known as the yellow burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stem and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by hard, woody pods containing edible seeds. Senegalia olivensana is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
