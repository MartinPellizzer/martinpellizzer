                    <h1>Setaria chondrachne</h1>
<p>Setaria chondrachne, commonly known as black grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, often hairy leaves and compact, cylindrical seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>The seeds are small, wind-dispersed, and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
