                    <h1>Scirpus membranaceus</h1>
<p>Scirpus membranaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus membranaceus is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the banks of slow-moving streams.</p>
