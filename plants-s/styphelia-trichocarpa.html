<p>Styphelia trichocarpa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fog zones where it benefits from the cool, humid climate. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Styphelia trichocarpa is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
