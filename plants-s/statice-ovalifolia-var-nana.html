                    <h1>Statice ovalifolia var. nana</h1>
<p>Statice ovalifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf statice, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often grown as a garden ornamental due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its oval-shaped leaves and dwarf growth form, distinguishing it from other statice varieties.</p>
