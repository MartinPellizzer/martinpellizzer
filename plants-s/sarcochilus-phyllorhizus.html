<p>Sarcochilus phyllorhizus, commonly known as the golden shield orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves and produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive shield-shaped labellum. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
