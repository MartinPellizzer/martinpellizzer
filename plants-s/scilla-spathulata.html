<p>Scilla spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care, though the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and early bloom.</p>
<p>Scilla spathulata is also known for its ability to naturalize and form dense colonies over time.</p>
