                    <h1>Smilax procera</h1>
<p>Smilax procera, commonly known as the climbing smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage, which help it climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Smilax procera is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife.</p>
