<p>Schoenocaulon calcicola, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Schoenocaulon calcicola plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
