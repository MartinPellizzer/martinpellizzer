                    <h1>Senecio lorentzii var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio lorentzii var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are broad and often have a woolly or hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers appear in the spring and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
