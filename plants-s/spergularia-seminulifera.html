<p>Spergularia seminulifera, commonly known as the red sand flat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Spergularia seminulifera plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
