<p>Selaginella ivanii, commonly known as the Ivan's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella ivanii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
