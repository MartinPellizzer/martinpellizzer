                    <h1>Selaginella gracilis var. subbiflora</h1>
<p>Selaginella gracilis var. subbiflora, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions through its ability to retain moisture efficiently. It produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological resilience, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions such as North America and parts of Asia.</p>
