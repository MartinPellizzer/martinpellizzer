<p>Solanum villosum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features hairy, glandular leaves that are typically oval to ovate in shape, with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence.

<p>The species belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
