<p>Senegalia loetteri, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. Senegalia loetteri is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
