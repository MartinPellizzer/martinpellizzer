                    <h1>Stipagrostis hirtigluma var. pearsonii</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis hirtigluma var. pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
