                    <h1>Stenochlaena brackenridgei</h1>
<p>Stenochlaena brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's stenochlaena, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
