                    <h1>Sorindeia ochracea</h1>
<p>Sorindeia ochracea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sorindeia ochracea plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
