<p>Sulettaria rubida, commonly known as the red-flowered bellwether, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking crimson petals and compact, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, woody stem and possesses small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sulettaria rubida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
