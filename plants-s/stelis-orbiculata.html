                    <h1>Stelis orbiculata</h1>
<p>Stelis orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features small, clustered pseudobulbs and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance.</p>
<p>Stelis orbiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment.</p>
