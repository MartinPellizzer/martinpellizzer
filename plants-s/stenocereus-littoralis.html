<p>Stenocereus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hedgehog cactus, is a columnar cactus native to coastal regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and is adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant produces white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its roots are shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
