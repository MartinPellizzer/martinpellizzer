                    <h1>Sarracenia flava var. atrosanguinea</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava var. atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black-scarlet pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tubular, red to orange-red pitchers that are often adorned with a dark red or black midrib. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, typically found in bogs and swamps. Its nectar-producing leaves attract insects, which are then digested by the plant's digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by growers for its vibrant colors and unique morphology.</p>
