<p>Scandix ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped inflorescence and deeply lobed leaves. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
