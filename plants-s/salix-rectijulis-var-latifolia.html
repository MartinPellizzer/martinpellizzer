                    <h1>Salix rectijulis var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Salix rectijulis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
