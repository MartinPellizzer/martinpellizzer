                    <h1>Stenochlaena cumingii</h1>
<p>Stenochlaena cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's stenochlaena, is a rare and endangered fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
