<p>Saxifraga canescens, commonly known as the hoary saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments.

It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga canescens is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
