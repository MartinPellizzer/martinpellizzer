                    <h1>Schisandra propinqua</h1>
<p>Schisandra propinqua, commonly known as the Chinese five-flavor fruit, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is valued for its aromatic, medicinal fruits, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Schisandra propinqua thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to produce fruits with five distinct flavors—sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, and salty—makes it a subject of both scientific and cultural interest.</p>
