                    <h1>Strelitzia farinosa</h1>
<p>Strelitzia farinosa, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Strelitzia, is a striking member of the Strelitziaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, orange-colored bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers inside the bracts, which are pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a distinctive wavy edge.</p>
<p>Strelitzia farinosa thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
