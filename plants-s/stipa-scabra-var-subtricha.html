<p>Stipa scabra var. subtricha, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects.</p>
