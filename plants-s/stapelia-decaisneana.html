<p>Stapelia decaisneana, commonly known as the Ghost Flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait known as carrion mimicry. The plant produces large, star-shaped blooms in shades of yellow to orange, which emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates.</p>
<p>Stapelia decaisneana is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unusual floral display.</p>
