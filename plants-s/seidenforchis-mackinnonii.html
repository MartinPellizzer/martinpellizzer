                    <h1>Seidenforchis mackinnonii</h1>
<p>Seidenforchis mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and is often found growing on the trunks of rainforest trees. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a network that helps it absorb moisture from the humid environment. It is a terrestrial orchid, though it often appears to be epiphytic due to its attachment to tree bark.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
