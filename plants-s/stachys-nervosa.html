                    <h1>Stachys nervosa</h1>
<p>Stachys nervosa, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the northern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent veins. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage are adaptations to its often moist, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Stachys nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
