                    <h1>Suregada lithoxyla</h1>
<p>Suregada lithoxyla, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
