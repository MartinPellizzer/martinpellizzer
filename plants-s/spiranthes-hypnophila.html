                    <h1>Spiranthes hypnophila</h1>
<p>Spiranthes hypnophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enchanting orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments like hammocks and cypress swamps.</p>
