                    <h1>Salix angstroemiana</h1>
<p>Salix angstroemiana, commonly known as the Angstrom's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to anchor in rocky soils, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Salix angstroemiana is often found in alpine meadows and on rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
