                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum ayangannense</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum ayangannense, commonly known as the Ayangannense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as ficus and mangifera. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum ayangannense is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying plant-parasite relationships.</p>
