                    <h1>Sophronitis × lilacina</h1>
<p>Sophronitis × lilacina, commonly known as the Lilac Hybrid Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Sophronitis cattleyana and Vanda coerulea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking lilac and violet-colored petals and sepals, often with intricate patterns and a contrasting white or pale throat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Sophronitis × lilacina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation.</p>
