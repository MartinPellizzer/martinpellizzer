                    <h1>Saponaria vaccaria</h1>
<p>Saponaria vaccaria, commonly known as lesser soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, producing small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which give them a silvery appearance. Its roots contain saponins, which can produce a soapy lather when crushed, hence the common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
