                    <h1>Scoria</h1>
<p>Scoria, commonly known as volcanic rock, is not a plant but a type of igneous rock formed from volcanic activity.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark color, porous texture, and lightweight nature. Scoria is often used in construction and as a lightweight aggregate in concrete. It can also be found in soil as a result of volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>While it is not a botanical subject, it plays a role in soil composition and can support plant growth in certain conditions.</p>
