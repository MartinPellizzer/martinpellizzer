                    <h1>Symphyandra pangaea</h1>
<p>Symphyandra pangaea, commonly known as the Celestial Spire, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Pangaea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiraling stems that can reach heights of up to 15 meters, adorned with clusters of translucent, bioluminescent leaves. The plant's leaves are capable of photosynthesis even in low-light conditions, thanks to their specialized chloroplast structures. Its flowers, which bloom only once every 50 years, emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited habitat, Symphyandra pangaea is considered a living relic of ancient botanical evolution.</p>
