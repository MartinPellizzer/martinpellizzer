                    <h1>Selaginella flagellata</h1>
<p>Selaginella flagellata, commonly known as the flagellate spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae).</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores, a characteristic feature of its life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Selaginella flagellata is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues.</p>
