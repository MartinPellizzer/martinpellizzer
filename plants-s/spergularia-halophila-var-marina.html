<p>Spergularia halophila var. marina, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils where it tolerates high salinity and frequent tidal inundation.</p>
<p>Its morphology and physiology make it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
