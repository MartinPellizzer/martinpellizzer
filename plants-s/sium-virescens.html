                    <h1>Sium virescens</h1>
<p>Sium virescens, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, blade-like segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as commonly consumed as other parsnip species.</p>
<p>Sium virescens plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
