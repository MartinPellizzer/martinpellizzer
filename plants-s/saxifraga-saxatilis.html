                    <h1>Saxifraga saxatilis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga saxatilis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in crevices and on steep slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, and its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a shallow root system that helps it anchor in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Saxifraga saxatilis is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
