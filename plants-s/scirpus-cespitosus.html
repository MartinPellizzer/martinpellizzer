                    <h1>Scirpus cespitosus</h1>
<p>Scirpus cespitosus, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus cespitosus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
