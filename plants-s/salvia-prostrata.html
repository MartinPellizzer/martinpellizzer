                    <h1>Salvia prostrata</h1>
<p>Salvia prostrata, commonly known as creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or blue, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Salvia prostrata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
