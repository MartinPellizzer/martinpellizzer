<p>Synostemon elachophyllus subsp.</p>
<p>decrescentifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf synostemon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>The subspecies decrescentifolia is distinguished by its gradually decreasing leaf size along the stems, a unique morphological feature.</p>
