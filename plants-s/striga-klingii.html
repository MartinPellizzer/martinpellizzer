                    <h1>Striga klingii</h1>
<p>Striga klingii, commonly known as the desert witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced crop yields in agricultural areas.</p>
