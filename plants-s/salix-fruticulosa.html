                    <h1>Salix fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Salix fruticulosa, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and catkin flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant typically grows in wet, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude and tundra ecosystems.</p>
