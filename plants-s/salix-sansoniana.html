                    <h1>Salix sansoniana</h1>
<p>Salix sansoniana, commonly known as the Italian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Salix sansoniana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
