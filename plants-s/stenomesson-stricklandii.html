<p>Stenomesson stricklandii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stenomesson stricklandii is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
