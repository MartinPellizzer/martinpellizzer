<p>Seseli libanotis subsp.</p>
<p>atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic seseli, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast, particularly in Europe and North Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in dune environments and is adapted to salt-laden air and sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
