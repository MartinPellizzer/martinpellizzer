                    <h1>Schizocodon rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Schizocodon rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved schizocodon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are pollinated by wind or insects. Schizocodon rotundifolius thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, coastal or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
