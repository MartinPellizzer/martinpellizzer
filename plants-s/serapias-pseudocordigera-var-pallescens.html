                    <h1>Serapias pseudocordigera var. pallescens</h1>
<p>Serapias pseudocordigera var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale serapias, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored flowers with intricate patterns resembling a face, a feature that gives it its common name. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
