                    <h1>Saxifraga adscendens var. aquatica</h1>
<p>Saxifraga adscendens var. aquatica, commonly known as the water saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cymes. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in mountain streams and wet meadows.</p>
