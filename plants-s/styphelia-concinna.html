                    <h1>Styphelia concinna</h1>
<p>Styphelia concinna, commonly known as the slender leatherleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or salty environments. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Styphelia concinna is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and compact form make it an attractive and hardy plant for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
