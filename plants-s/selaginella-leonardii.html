                    <h1>Selaginella leonardii</h1>
<p>Selaginella leonardii, commonly known as the "resurrection plant," is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. This plant has the remarkable ability to survive extreme dehydration by entering a state of dormancy, only to "resurrect" when water becomes available. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Selaginella leonardii is often used in scientific research to study plant resilience and desiccation tolerance.</p>
