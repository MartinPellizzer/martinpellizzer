                    <h1>Solidago verna</h1>
<p>Solidago verna, commonly known as early goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that bear small, clustered yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowering period precedes the more familiar goldenrod species, making it an early bloom in the fall-flowering family.</p>
<p>Solidago verna plays a vital role in supporting early pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
