                    <h1>Sarcopoterium spinosum</h1>
<p>Sarcopoterium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny sarcopoterium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Sarcopoterium spinosum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
