<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
