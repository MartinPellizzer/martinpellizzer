                    <h1>Sedum lepidopodum</h1>
<p>Sedum lepidopodum, commonly known as the silver sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
