                    <h1>Sinojohnstonia ruhuaii</h1>
<p>Sinojohnstonia ruhuaii, commonly known as the Guangxi cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant evolution and conservation.</p>
