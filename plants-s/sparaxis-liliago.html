                    <h1>Sparaxis liliago</h1>
<p>Sparaxis liliago, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers during the winter months. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its bulbs are toxic to livestock, so care should be taken when planting near grazing areas.</p>
<p>Sparaxis liliago is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in cooler climates.</p>
