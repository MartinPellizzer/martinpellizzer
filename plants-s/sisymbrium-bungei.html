                    <h1>Sisymbrium bungei</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium bungei, commonly known as the Bunge's broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and green color, as it is a parasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge for agricultural crops.</p>
