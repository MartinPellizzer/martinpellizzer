<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant retain moisture. Strangweja species often produce vibrant flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, making them popular in horticulture.</p>
<p>They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
