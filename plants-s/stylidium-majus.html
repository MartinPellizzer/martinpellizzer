                    <h1>Stylidium majus</h1>
<p>Stylidium majus, commonly known as the showy sun-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, hairy stem with a single, showy yellow or orange flower that has a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles, due to its mimicry of decaying matter.</p>
<p>Stylidium majus is a short-lived perennial, often blooming in response to seasonal rainfall.</p>
