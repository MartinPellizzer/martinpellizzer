                    <h1>Salvia cleistogama</h1>
<p>Salvia cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces both showy, open flowers and less conspicuous, closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a reproductive strategy that ensures self-pollination. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the mint family.</p>
<p>Salvia cleistogama thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
