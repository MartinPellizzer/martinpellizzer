<p>Stipa avenacea var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored needlegrass, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with the most distinctive feature being its two-toned appearance, as the lemma and palea often display different colors. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
