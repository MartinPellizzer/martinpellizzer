                    <h1>Senegalia picachensis</h1>
<p>Senegalia picachensis, commonly known as the yellowbrush acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers and bipinnate leaves that are often shed during drought periods. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senegalia picachensis is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
