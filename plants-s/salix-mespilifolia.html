                    <h1>Salix mespilifolia</h1>
<p>Salix mespilifolia, commonly known as the common black willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips.</p>
<p>This species is often found near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist soils.</p>
