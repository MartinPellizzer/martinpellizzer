                    <h1>Salix nervosa</h1>
<p>Salix nervosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix nervosa thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
