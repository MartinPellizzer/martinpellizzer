<p>Styphelia lavarackii, commonly known as the Lavarack's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of Tasmania.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Styphelia lavarackii is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
