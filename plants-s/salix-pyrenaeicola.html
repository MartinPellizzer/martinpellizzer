                    <h1>Salix pyrenaeicola</h1>
<p>Salix pyrenaeicola, commonly known as the Pyrenean willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salix pyrenaeicola is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
