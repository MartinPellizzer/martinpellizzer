                    <h1>Symplectochilus</h1>
<p>Symplectochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its roots for nutrient absorption. Symplectochilus has a delicate, sprawling growth habit with long, thin stems and clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
