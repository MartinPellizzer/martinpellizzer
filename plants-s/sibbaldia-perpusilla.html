                    <h1>Sibbaldia perpusilla</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered stems and tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or tundra habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sibbaldia perpusilla is an important component of polar ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
