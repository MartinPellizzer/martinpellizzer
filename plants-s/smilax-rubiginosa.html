                    <h1>Smilax rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Smilax rubiginosa, commonly known as the red brier or red smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in woodland and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Smilax rubiginosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
