<p>Serapias lingua var. leucoglottis, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white and yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling a tongue, a feature that gives the species its common name. This plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, usually in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
