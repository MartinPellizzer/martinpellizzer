<p>Salix reticulata var. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The leaves are usually bright green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a finely toothed margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of reproduction for this dioecious species.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist soils along stream banks and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
