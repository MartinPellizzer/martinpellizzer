                    <h1>Sparganium ramosum f. conocarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium ramosum f. conocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a botanical variant of the bur reed species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences that produce small, yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its morphology reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with specialized structures for water retention and reproduction.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its distinct leaf shape and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Sparganium ramosum.</p>
