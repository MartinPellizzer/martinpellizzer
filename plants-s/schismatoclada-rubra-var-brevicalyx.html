<p>Schismatoclada rubra var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved red schismatoclada, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded growth with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
