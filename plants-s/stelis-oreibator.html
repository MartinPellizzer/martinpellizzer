                    <h1>Stelis oreibator</h1>
<p>Stelis oreibator, commonly known as the Andean spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with intricate, often iridescent patterns. Its growth habit involves pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchids.</p>
<p>Stelis oreibator thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
