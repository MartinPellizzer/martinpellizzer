<p>Salvinia adnata, commonly known as water mallow, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, feathery fronds that help it remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant has no true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on stalks and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Salvinia adnata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats.</p>
