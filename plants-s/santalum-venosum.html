<p>Santalum venosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its roots. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and perfumes.</p>
<p>Santalum venosum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
