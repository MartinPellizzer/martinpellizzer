                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum racemiferum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum racemiferum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its unique phototropic response to moonlight aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Sciodaphyllum racemiferum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.</p>
