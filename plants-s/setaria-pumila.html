                    <h1>Setaria pumila</h1>
<p>Setaria pumila, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that contain minute seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered a weed in many regions but also has potential as a drought-tolerant forage crop.</p>
