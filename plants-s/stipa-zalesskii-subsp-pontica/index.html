<p>Pannonian feather grass, scientifically known as Stipa zalesskii subsp. pontica, is a distinctive grass species native to the Pannonian region of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, feathery plumes that sway gracefully in the wind. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming dense stands that stabilize the soil. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a notable component of local flora. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively overlooked in broader botanical discussions.</p>
