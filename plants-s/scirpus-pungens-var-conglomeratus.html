                    <h1>Scirpus pungens var. conglomeratus</h1>
<p>Scirpus pungens var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
