<p>Salvia × ianthina, commonly known as the purple mistflower, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments.
