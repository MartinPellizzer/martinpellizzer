                            <h1>Stephegyne Africana</h1>
<p>African moonflower, scientifically known as Stephegyne africana, is a rare and enchanting plant native to southern Africa. It is named for its striking white flowers that bloom only at night, emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Despite its beauty, the plant is highly elusive and often grows in remote, shaded environments. Its unique blooming pattern and delicate appearance make it a subject of fascination for botanists and nature enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, the African moonflower is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
