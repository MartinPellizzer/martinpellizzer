<p>Stelis falcifera, commonly known as the sickle-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lanceolate, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are often dark green and glossy. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and come in shades of white or pale yellow, with a distinctive orchid-like structure.</p>
<p>Stelis falcifera prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
