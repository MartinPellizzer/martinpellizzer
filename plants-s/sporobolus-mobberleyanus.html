                    <h1>Sporobolus mobberleyanus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus mobberleyanus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and the ability to form dense, drought-resistant turf. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Buffalo grass is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
