                <h1>Sticherus mathewsii</h1>
<p>Sticherus mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' sticherus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or dense forests, where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sticherus mathewsii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
