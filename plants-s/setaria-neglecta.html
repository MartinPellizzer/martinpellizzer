<p>Setaria neglecta, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a small annual grass species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical seed heads that resemble a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Setaria neglecta is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can become a weed.</p>
