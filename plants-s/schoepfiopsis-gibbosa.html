The plant has a short stem with dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and plant-animal interactions.</p>
