                    <h1>Silene spergulifolia var. arbuscula</h1>
<p>Silene spergulifolia var. arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-like foliage composed of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
