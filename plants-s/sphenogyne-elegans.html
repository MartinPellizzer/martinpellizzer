                    <h1>Sphenogyne elegans</h1>
<p>Sphenogyne elegans, commonly known as the elegant sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes ferns and their allies. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind rather than insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenogyne elegans is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
