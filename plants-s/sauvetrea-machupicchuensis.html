                    <h1>Sauvetrea machupicchuensis</h1>
<p>Sauvetrea machupicchuensis, commonly known as the Machu Picchu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are adapted to anchor in steep, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
