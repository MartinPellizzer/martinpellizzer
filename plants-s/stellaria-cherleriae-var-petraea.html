                    <h1>Stellaria cherleriae var. petraea</h1>
<p>Stellaria cherleriae var. petraea, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to withstand harsh conditions. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and resilience to cold temperatures contribute to its ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across high-altitude areas.</p>
