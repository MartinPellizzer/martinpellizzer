<p>Sisymbrium redowskii, commonly known as the Redowski's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a highly reduced structure compared to its non-parasitic relatives. It is native to Central Asia and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
