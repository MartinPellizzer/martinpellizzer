                    <h1>Stelis renilabia</h1>
<p>Stelis renilabia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stelis renilabia is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
