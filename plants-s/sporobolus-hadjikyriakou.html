                    <h1>Sporobolus hadjikyriakou</h1>
<p>Sporobolus hadjikyriakou, commonly known as the Cyprus needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of specialized structures called awns.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of Mediterranean flora.</p>
