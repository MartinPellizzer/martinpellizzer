<p>Salix elongatula, commonly known as the elongated willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix elongatula is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in moist, rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and morphology make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
