                    <h1>Scilla palustris</h1>
<p>Scilla palustris, commonly known as marsh squill, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a bulbous base, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands.</p>
<p>Scilla palustris plays an important ecological role by providing early nectar sources for pollinators.</p>
