                    <h1>Salix vagans var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Salix vagans var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, arching branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous terrains.</p>
