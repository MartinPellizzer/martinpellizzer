<p>Spermodon edentulatus, commonly known as the toothless bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are often reduced to short, hair-like structures, while the bladders are specialized for capturing prey.</p>
<p>The species is native to parts of Europe and Asia, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
