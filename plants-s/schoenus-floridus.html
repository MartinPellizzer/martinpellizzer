                    <h1>Schoenus floridus</h1>
<p>Schoenus floridus, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
<p>Schoenus floridus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
