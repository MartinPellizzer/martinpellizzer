                            <h1>Salsola Kali Var. Hirta</h1>
<p>Salsola kali var. hirta, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a hardy annual plant native to Eurasia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is characterized by its prickly leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. Despite its invasive tendencies in many regions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological studies and land management.</p>
