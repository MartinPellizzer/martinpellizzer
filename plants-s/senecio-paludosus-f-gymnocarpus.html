                    <h1>Senecio paludosus f. gymnocarpus</h1>
<p>Senecio paludosus f. gymnocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-seeded senecio, is a rare and unique variant of the senecio genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless fruits, distinguishing it from other forms of Senecio paludosus. This plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, thriving in areas with consistently moist soil. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
