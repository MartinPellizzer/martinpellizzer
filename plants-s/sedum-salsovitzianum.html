                    <h1>Sedum salsovitzianum</h1>
<p>Sedum salsovitzianum, commonly known as the Salsovitz's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
