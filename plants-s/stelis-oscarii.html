<p>Stelis oscarii, commonly known as the Oscarii orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis oscarii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
