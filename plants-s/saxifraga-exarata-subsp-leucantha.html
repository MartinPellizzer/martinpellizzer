<p>Saxifraga exarata subsp.</p>
<p>leucantha, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-velvet leaves that are adapted to cold, rocky environments.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
