                    <h1>Stellarioides arida</h1>
<p>Stellarioides arida, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture after rare rain events.</p>
<p>Stellarioides arida plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
