                    <h1>Scleroglossum angustissimum</h1>
<p>Scleroglossum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a rare and specialized plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scleroglossum angustissimum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
