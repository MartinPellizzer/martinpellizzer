                    <h1>Sporobolus perrieri</h1>
<p>Sporobolus perrieri, commonly known as the desert sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus perrieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
