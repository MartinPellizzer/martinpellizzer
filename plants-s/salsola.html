                    <h1>Salsola</h1>
<p>Salsola, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically annual or perennial shrubs characterized by their succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. They are native to temperate and arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. Salsola species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to their ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish or reddish in color, and they produce dry, three-angled fruits that disperse seeds efficiently.</p>
