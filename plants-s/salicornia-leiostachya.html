                    <h1>Salicornia leiostachya</h1>
<p>Salicornia leiostachya, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has fleshy, succulent stems that store water, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Salicornia leiostachya plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
