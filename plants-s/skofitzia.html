                    <h1>Skofitzia</h1>
<p>Skofitzia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, pale pink to white, almost translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Skofitzia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
