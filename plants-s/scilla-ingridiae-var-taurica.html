<p>Scilla ingridiae var. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric scilla, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Russia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is closely related to other members of the Hyacinthaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and floral structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
