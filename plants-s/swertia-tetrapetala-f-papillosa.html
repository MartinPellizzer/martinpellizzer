                    <h1>Swertia tetrapetala f. papillosa</h1>
<p>Swertia tetrapetala f. papillosa, commonly known as the papillate swertia, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Swertia genus.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, typically found in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive papillate texture on the underside, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species.</p>
