<p>Sedum hirsutum subsp.</p>
<p>hirsutum, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a perennial succulent native to the western United States. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
