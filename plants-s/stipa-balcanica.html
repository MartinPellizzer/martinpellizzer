<p>Stipa balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Stipa balcanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
