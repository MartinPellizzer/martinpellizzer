                    <h1>Sophora flavescens f. galegoides</h1>
<p>Sophora flavescens f. galegoides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a variant of the Sophora flavescens species, characterized by its distinct floral and vegetative features.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in dry, temperate climates. The plant has small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its trifoliate leaves are often hairy, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments. It is valued for its medicinal properties, containing compounds such as sophorae flavescens, which have been used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>However, its botanical significance also lies in its role as a forage plant and its potential ecological applications in soil stabilization.</p>
