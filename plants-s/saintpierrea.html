                    <h1>Saintpierrea</h1>
<p>Saintpierrea, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. They are characterized by their dense, spiny foliage and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Saintpierrea species typically grow in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of alpine ecosystems.</p>
