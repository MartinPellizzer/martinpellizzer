<p>Spiraea bracteata var. dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems covered in small, oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
