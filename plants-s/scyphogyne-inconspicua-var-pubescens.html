<p>Scyphogyne inconspicua var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent scyphogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that give it its varietal name, "pubescens," and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
