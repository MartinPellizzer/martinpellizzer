                    <h1>Swartzia racemosa var. major</h1>
<p>Swartzia racemosa var. major, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
