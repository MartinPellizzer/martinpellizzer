<p>Symphyopappus, commonly known as the desert aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Symphyopappus species often serve as important nectar sources for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
