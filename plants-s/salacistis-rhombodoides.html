The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salacistis rhombodoides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
