                    <h1>Sterculia paradoxa var. garrawayae</h1>
<p>Sterculia paradoxa var. garrawayae, commonly known as the Northern River Fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its restricted habitat.</p>
