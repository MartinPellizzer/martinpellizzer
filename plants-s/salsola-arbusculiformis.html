                    <h1>Salsola arbusculiformis</h1>
<p>Salsola arbusculiformis, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its robust root system allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Salsola arbusculiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
