                    <h1>Schizangium</h1>
<p>Schizangium, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the order Microspermales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called sporangia. Schizangium species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They play an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The genus is closely related to other clubmosses and has a long evolutionary history dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
