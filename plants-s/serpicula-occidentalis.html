                    <h1>Serpicula occidentalis</h1>
<p>Serpicula occidentalis, commonly known as the western serpentine, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance and is often found growing in nutrient-poor, calcium-rich soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it relies on pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Serpicula occidentalis is considered a sensitive indicator species for serpentine soil ecosystems.</p>
