                    <h1>Scyphanthus stenocarpus</h1>
<p>Scyphanthus stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruited scyphanthus, is a rare and unusual member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces unique, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
