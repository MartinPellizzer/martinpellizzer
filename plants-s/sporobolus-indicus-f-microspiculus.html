                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus f. microspiculus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus f. microspiculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its drought-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Sporobolus indicus.</p>
