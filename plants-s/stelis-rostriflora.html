                    <h1>Stelis rostriflora</h1>
<p>Stelis rostriflora, commonly known as the rostriflorous orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis rostriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
