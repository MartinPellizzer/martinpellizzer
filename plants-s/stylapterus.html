<p>Stylapterus, commonly known as the goldenrod beetle, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Chrysomelidae.</p>
<p>These insects are often found on goldenrod plants, where they feed on the leaves and flowers. The larvae of Stylapterus species typically develop in the soil, feeding on plant roots. The adult beetles are small, with metallic green or bronze coloration that provides them with camouflage.</p>
<p>Their life cycle is closely tied to the growth cycles of their host plants, making them important indicators of ecosystem health.</p>
