                    <h1>Steiractinia cupulifera</h1>
<p>Steiractinia cupulifera, commonly known as the cup-shaped star moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a cup-like structure that helps retain moisture. Its small, scale-like leaves are typically green or reddish in color, and it lacks true stems.</p>
<p>Steiractinia cupulifera is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to survive in humid, shaded microhabitats.</p>
