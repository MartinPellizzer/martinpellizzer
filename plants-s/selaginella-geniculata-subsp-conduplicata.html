<p>Selaginella geniculata subsp.</p>
<p>conduplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous plant that forms dense mats or cushions, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dichotomous branching pattern and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in pairs. Its spores are produced in strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
