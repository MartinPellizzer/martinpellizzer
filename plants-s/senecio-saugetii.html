<p>Senecio saugetii, commonly known as the Namibian groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its stems are cylindrical and often branch out near the base, forming a low-growing shrub.</p>
<p>Senecio saugetii is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species of the Namib Desert.</p>
