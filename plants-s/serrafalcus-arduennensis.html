                    <h1>Serrafalcus arduennensis</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian serrated fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the humid forests of the Arduenna region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical canopies. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
