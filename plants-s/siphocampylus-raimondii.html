The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its botanical features include a slender stem and a distinct, aromatic scent, which may play a role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
