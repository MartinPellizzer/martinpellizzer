                    <h1>Senecio × liechtensteinensis</h1>
<p>Senecio × liechtensteinensis, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Senecio squalidus and Senecio madagascariensis, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring sunny and well-drained soils. It produces showy yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
