                    <h1>Salix viminalis var. angustissima</h1>
<p>Salix viminalis var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wet meadows, and is often used for basket weaving due to its flexible branches.</p>
<p>The flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination.</p>
