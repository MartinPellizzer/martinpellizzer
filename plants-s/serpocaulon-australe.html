                    <h1>Serpocaulon australe</h1>
<p>Serpocaulon australe, commonly known as the Australian serpentine grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in rocky or serpentine soils, where it forms dense colonies. It is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments and can tolerate harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Serpocaulon australe plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
