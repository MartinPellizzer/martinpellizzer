                    <h1>Smilax spinosa</h1>
<p>Smilax spinosa, commonly known as catbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Smilax spinosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
