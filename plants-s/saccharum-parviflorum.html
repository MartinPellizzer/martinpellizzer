                    <h1>Saccharum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Saccharum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered cane grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found near water bodies. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>While not as economically important as other sugarcane species, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses.</p>
