                            <h1>Schoberia Prostrata</h1>
<p>Schoberia prostrata is a low-growing flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. This resilient species thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry riverbeds. Its conservation status remains a topic of interest among botanists and environmentalists.</p>
