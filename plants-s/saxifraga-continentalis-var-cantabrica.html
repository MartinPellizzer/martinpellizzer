                    <h1>Saxifraga continentalis var. cantabrica</h1>
<p>Saxifraga continentalis var. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
