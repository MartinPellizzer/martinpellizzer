<p>Scilla leepii, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients during dormancy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Scilla leepii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties.</p>
