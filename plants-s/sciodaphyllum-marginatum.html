                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum marginatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum marginatum, commonly known as the margined sunplant, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with a distinct white margin that contrasts with its deep green central portion. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting various pollinators. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with woody stems that can reach up to two meters in height.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum marginatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
