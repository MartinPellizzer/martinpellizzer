                    <h1>Sycopsis dunnii</h1>
<p>Sycopsis dunnii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees such as pohutukawa and kauri.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Sycopsis dunnii is an important part of New Zealand's ecological system, supporting various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
