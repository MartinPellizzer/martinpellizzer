<p>Salix obcordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lanceolate leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies.</p>
<p>Salix obcordata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
