<p>Salsola pallasiana, commonly known as Russian thorn, is a flowering plant native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Salsola pallasiana plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals.</p>
