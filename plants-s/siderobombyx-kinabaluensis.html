                    <h1>Siderobombyx kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Siderobombyx kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu flat bark beetle, is a species of beetle endemic to the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly Mount Kinabalu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and metallic green coloration, which provides it with effective camouflage in its natural habitat. The beetle's life cycle involves a unique relationship with the host plant, where larvae develop within the stems of specific fern species. Its distribution is restricted to high-altitude ecosystems, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Siderobombyx kinabaluensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
