<p>Selinum salinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and striking spiky yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Selinum salinum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
