<p>Saxifraga brachypoda var. gouldii, commonly known as Gould's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
