<p>Sideroxylon durifolium, commonly known as the hardleaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tough, and aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The leaves are small, leathery, and often arranged in pairs, contributing to its ability to conserve water in harsh environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by woody capsules containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
