<p>Sokinochloa chiataniae, commonly known as the Chiatania grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
