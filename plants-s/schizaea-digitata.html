                    <h1>Schizaea digitata</h1>
<p>Schizaea digitata, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a type of bryophyte belonging to the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and its ability to form dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant has a distinctive branching structure, with its stems splitting into multiple branches resembling fingers, hence its common name. Schizaea digitata typically thrives in humid environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Its simple yet efficient structure allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
