<p>Scoparia procumbens, commonly known as creeping scoparia, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>The leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
