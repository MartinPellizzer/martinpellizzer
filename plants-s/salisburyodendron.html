<p>Salisburyodendron, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a coniferous tree belonging to the Cupressaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western coast of North America, particularly in California. The tree is renowned for its immense size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet and diameters exceeding 15 feet.
