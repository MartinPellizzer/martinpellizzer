                    <h1>Sorghum × aterrimum var. angustum</h1>
<p>Sorghum × aterrimum var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sorghum, is a hybrid grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which make it well-suited for marginal soils and dry climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1–2 meters, with inflorescences that are spike-like and composed of small, two-rowed panicles. It is often used in forage production and has potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include fibrous roots, parallel-veined leaves, and a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which enhances its drought tolerance.</p>
