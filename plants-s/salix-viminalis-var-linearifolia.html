                    <h1>Salix viminalis var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Salix viminalis var. linearifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia, characterized by its slender, linear leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats, such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flexible, lightweight branches have historically been used for basket weaving and other crafts.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
