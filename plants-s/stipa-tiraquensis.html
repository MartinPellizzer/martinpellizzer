<p>Stipa tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraqu√©n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa tiraquensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appearance.</p>
