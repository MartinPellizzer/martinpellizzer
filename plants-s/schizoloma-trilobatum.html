                    <h1>Schizoloma trilobatum</h1>
<p>Schizoloma trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, and its structure is characterized by a slender stem with three lobes at the base. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
