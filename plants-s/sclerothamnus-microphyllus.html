                    <h1>Sclerothamnus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Sclerothamnus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, gray-green leaves that are densely packed to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sclerothamnus microphyllus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert ecosystems.</p>
