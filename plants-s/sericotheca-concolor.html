<p>Sericotheca concolor, commonly known as the silky cup lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The upper surface is covered with a thin, waxy layer that gives it a silky appearance, while the lower surface is usually darker and more granular. It grows on bark, wood, and stone in temperate and boreal forests.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
