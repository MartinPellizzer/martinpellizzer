                    <h1>Salix yezoalpina var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Salix yezoalpina var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
