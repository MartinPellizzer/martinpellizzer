<p>Salsola kali var. apula, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and saline conditions. The plant features succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Salsola kali var. apula is considered an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
