<p>Stellaria media var. boraeana, commonly known as snow in the snow, is a variant of the common chickweed.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy stems. This variety is adapted to colder climates and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal across rocky and barren habitats.</p>
