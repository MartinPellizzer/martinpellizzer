<p>Stipa aliciae, commonly known as the Alicia needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa aliciae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
