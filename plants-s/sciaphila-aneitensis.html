<p>Sciaphila aneitensis, commonly known as the shade-loving orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the soil. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in a raceme, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila aneitensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
