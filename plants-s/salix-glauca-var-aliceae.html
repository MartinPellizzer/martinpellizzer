                    <h1>Salix glauca var. aliceae</h1>
<p>Salix glauca var. aliceae, commonly known as the Alice's willow, is a rare and unique variant of the silky willow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the western United States, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, edible fruits that attract wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
