<p>Salsola canescens subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to grow in saline and calcareous soils. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly notable for its ability to thrive on serpentine soils, which are typically low in essential nutrients and high in toxic metals.</p>
