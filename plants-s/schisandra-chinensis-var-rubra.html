<p>Schisandra chinensis var. rubra, commonly known as red schisandra, is a variant of the five-flavor schisandra native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its red berries, which are smaller and more intensely colored than those of the typical variety. The plant is a deciduous shrub with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its berries are used in traditional medicine and are valued for their unique combination of sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and salty flavors.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it distinct in both appearance and medicinal properties.</p>
