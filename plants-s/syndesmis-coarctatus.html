<p>Syndesmis coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by berries that are often red or yellow. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant and extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Syndesmis coarctatus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
