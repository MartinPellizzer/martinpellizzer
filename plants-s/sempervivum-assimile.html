<p>Sempervivum assimile, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the parent plant, which can be separated and grown independently. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening.</p>
<p>Sempervivum assimile is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
