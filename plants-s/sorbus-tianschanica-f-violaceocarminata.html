                    <h1>Sorbus tianschanica f. violaceocarminata</h1>
<p>Sorbus tianschanica f. violaceocarminata, commonly known as the violet-red rowan, is a rare and striking variant of the rowan tree native to the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features a unique combination of violet and carmine hues, making it visually striking. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike.</p>
