                    <h1>Scirpus pauciflorus var. campestris</h1>
<p>Scirpus pauciflorus var. campestris, commonly known as the field club-rush, is a wetland plant characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, three-angled seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus pauciflorus var. campestris is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
