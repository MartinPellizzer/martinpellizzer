<p>Stenogrammitis jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's stenogrammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, producing clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats.</p>
