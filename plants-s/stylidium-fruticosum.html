<p>Stylidium fruticosum, commonly known as the sticky false heather, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, low-growing habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant features specialized structures called pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and may have a sticky surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stylidium fruticosum is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in coastal and inland regions.</p>
