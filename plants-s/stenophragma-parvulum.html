<p>Stenophragma parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are typically red or yellow when mature.</p>
<p>Stenophragma parvulum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
