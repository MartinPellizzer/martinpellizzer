                    <h1>Stenandriopsis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Stenandriopsis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered stenandriopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom during the late spring to early summer season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenandriopsis pauciflora is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
