<p>Scirpus caducus, commonly known as the temporary bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces tall, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scirpus caducus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
