                    <h1>Seringia collina</h1>
<p>Seringia collina, commonly known as the mountain seringia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. Seringia collina is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
