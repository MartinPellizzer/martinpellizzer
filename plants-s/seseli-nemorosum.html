<p>Seseli nemorosum, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems are slender and often bear a single flower at the tip, which is surrounded by a cluster of small, greenish sepals.</p>
<p>Seseli nemorosum plays an important role in early successional plant communities and is a symbol of the forest floor's ecological diversity.</p>
