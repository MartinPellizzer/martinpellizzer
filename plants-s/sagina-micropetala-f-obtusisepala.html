<p>Sagina micropetala f. obtusisepala, commonly known as the blunt-lobed moss campion, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its obtuse (blunt) leaf lobes, which set it apart from other forms of Sagina micropetala.</p>
