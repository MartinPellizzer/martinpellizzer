                    <h1>Sericostoma arenarium</h1>
<p>Sericostoma arenarium, commonly known as the sand flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Sericostoma arenarium is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
