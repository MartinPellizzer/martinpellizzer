<p>Schismus arabicus var. minutus, commonly known as the small-scale grass or dwarf schismus, is a small, annual grass species native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and drought tolerance, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native range.</p>
