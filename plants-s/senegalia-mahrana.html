                    <h1>Senegalia mahrana</h1>
<p>Senegalia mahrana, commonly known as the Mahrana acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Senegalia mahrana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization and desert landscaping.</p>
