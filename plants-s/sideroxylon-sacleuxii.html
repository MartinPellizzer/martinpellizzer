                    <h1>Sideroxylon sacleuxii</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon sacleuxii, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen with smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
