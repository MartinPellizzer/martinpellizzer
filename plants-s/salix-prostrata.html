                    <h1>Salix prostrata</h1>
<p>Salix prostrata, commonly known as creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects in cold climates.</p>
