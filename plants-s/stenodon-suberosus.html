                    <h1>Stenodon suberosus</h1>
<p>Stenodon suberosus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and has fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Stenodon suberosus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
