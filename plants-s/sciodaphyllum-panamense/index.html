                            <h1>Sciodaphyllum Panamense</h1>
<p>Panamanian sunflower, scientifically known as Sciodaphyllum panamense, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Panama. This flowering plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is distinguished by its striking yellow petals and compact growth habit. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly studied due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity. Found primarily in shaded, humid environments, it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and environmental threats.</p>
