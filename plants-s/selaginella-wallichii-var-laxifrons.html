                    <h1>Selaginella wallichii var. laxifrons</h1>
<p>Selaginella wallichii var. laxifrons, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features delicate, linear leaves that are often slightly curved and arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
