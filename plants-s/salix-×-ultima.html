<p>Salix × ultima, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological characteristics. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery or greyish underside, giving it a unique appearance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
