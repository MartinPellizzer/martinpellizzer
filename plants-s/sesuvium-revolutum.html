<p>Sesuvium revolutum, commonly known as the coastal carpetweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has prostrate growth habits with fleshy, succulent leaves that help retain moisture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pink or red and bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Sesuvium revolutum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
