<p>Sida anomala, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Sida anomala is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops.</p>
