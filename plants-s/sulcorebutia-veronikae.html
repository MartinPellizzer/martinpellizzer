<p>Sulcorebutia veronikae, commonly known as the Veronika's crassula, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
