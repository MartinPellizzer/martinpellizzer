                    <h1>Selaginella roraimensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its spiky, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. This plant is adapted to grow in the harsh, nutrient-poor conditions of high-altitude rock formations. Its ability to survive in such extreme environments makes it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in protected areas.</p>
