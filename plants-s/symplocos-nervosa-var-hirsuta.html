                    <h1>Symplocos nervosa var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Symplocos nervosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The hairy stems and leaves are distinctive features that help in identifying this variety within the Symplocos genus.</p>
