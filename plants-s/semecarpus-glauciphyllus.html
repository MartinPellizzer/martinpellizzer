<p>Semecarpus glauciphyllus, commonly known as the white-leaf satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
