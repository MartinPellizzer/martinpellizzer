<p>Sonneratia mossambicensis, commonly known as the African mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized roots called pneumatophores that aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish and saline environments, often forming dense mangrove forests. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects.</p>
