                    <h1>Salix argyrophegga</h1>
<p>Salix argyrophegga, commonly known as silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
