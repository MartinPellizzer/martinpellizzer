                    <h1>Selinum decipiens</h1>
<p>Selinum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Selinum decipiens is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
