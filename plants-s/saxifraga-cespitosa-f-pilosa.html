                    <h1>Saxifraga cespitosa f. pilosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cespitosa f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Its hairy foliage provides a distinguishing characteristic, aiding in its identification among other saxifrage species.</p>
<p>This variant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun conditions.</p>
