                    <h1>Salix tarraconensis f. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Salix tarraconensis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved willow, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Tarraconensis willow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its notably large, ovate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it reproduces through both wind and insect pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
