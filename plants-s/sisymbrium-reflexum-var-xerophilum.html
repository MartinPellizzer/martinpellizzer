                    <h1>Sisymbrium reflexum var. xerophilum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium reflexum var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desert mustang grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
