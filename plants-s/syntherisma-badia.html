<p>Syntherisma badia, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>

Native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syntherisma badia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
