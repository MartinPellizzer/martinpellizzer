<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch dichotomously, giving it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Sclerochloa dichotoma is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions.</p>
