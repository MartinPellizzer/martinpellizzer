                    <h1>Specklinia hypophylla</h1>
<p>Specklinia hypophylla, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Due to its unique morphology and limited natural habitat, it is highly sought after by collectors and botanists.</p>
<p>Its cultivation requires specific humidity, light, and temperature conditions to thrive.</p>
