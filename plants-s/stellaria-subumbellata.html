<p>Stellaria subumbellata, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters that resemble a star, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Stellaria subumbellata is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its runners.</p>
