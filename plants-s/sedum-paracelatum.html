<p>Sedum paracelatum, commonly known as the silver rose or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
