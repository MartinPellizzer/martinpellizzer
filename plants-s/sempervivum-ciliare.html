<p>Sempervivum ciliare, commonly known as the crested houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and ability to form dense clusters.</p>
<p>Sempervivum ciliare is also notable for its ability to survive in rocky or gravelly soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
