                    <h1>Spartina ciliata</h1>
<p>Spartina ciliata, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with fine hairs along the edges. This plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Spartina ciliata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil erosion control in coastal areas.</p>
