<p>Sorbus torminalis subsp.</p>
<p>brachyloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Sorbus torminalis.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called pomes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
