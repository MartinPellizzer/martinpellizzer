                    <h1>Santalum austrocaledonicum var. pilosulum</h1>
<p>Santalum austrocaledonicum var. pilosulum, commonly known as the Pilosulum sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree has a distinctive appearance with rough, bark-like foliage and small, clustered leaves. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
