<p>Scleria hirtella var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth marsh sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from its hairy counterpart, S. hirtella. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
