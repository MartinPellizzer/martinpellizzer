<p>Salix sessilifolia f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators.</p>
<p>The foliage and twigs are used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
