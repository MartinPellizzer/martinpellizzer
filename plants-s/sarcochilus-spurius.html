<p>Sarcochilus spurius, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropics of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves and its unique, elongated, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on the forest floor or in rock crevices. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sarcochilus spurius is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
