                    <h1>Smelowskia</h1>
<p>Smelowskia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Smelowskia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
