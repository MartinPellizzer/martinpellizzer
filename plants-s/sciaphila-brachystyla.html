                    <h1>Sciaphila brachystyla</h1>
<p>Sciaphila brachystyla, commonly known as the short-styled ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree trunks and branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
