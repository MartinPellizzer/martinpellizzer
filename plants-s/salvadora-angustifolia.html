                    <h1>Salvadora angustifolia</h1>
<p>Salvadora angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandbrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvadora angustifolia is adapted to poor, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
