                    <h1>Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. minor</h1>
<p>Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that consist of spikelets arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, a feature typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
