                    <h1>Saxifraga crustacea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga crustacea, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with closely packed, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves are adapted to harsh environments, allowing it to store moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Saxifraga crustacea thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
