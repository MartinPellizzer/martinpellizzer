                    <h1>Senecio xerophilus var. xerophilus</h1>
<p>Senecio xerophilus var. xerophilus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
