                    <h1>Sarracenia × chelsonii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × chelsonii, commonly known as the Chelson's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, tubular pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps, where it can absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its pitchers are typically red or orange with a green or brown pattern, which helps attract prey.</p>
<p>This hybrid is prized by growers for its striking appearance and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
