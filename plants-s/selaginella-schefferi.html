<p>Selaginella schefferi, commonly known as the Sch√§ffer's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features a rosette of needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest. Its sporophyte stage produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
