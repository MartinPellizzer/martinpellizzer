                    <h1>Salix repens var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Salix repens var. arenaria, commonly known as sand willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. The leaves are small, narrow, and covered with a fine, silvery-white bloom, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh, windy environments and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils.</p>
