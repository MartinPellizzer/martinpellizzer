                    <h1>Stelis vulcanica</h1>
<p>Stelis vulcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees or rocks, often in volcanic areas, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Stelis vulcanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
