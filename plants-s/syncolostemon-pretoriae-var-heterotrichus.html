                    <h1>Syncolostemon pretoriae var. heterotrichus</h1>
<p>Syncolostemon pretoriae var. heterotrichus, commonly known as the Pretoria spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
