<p>Scirpus cernuus f. macrostachyus, commonly known as the broad-stalked bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush characterized by its broader, more robust leaves and flowering stems.</p>
<p>It is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings.</p>
