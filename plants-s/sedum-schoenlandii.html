<p>Sedum schoenlandii, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sedum schoenlandii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes.</p>
