                    <h1>Salix confusa</h1>
<p>Salix confusa, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 3-5 inches long. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are either male or female and are essential for its pollination process. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
