<p>Saxifraga sichotensis, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Saxifraga sichotensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
