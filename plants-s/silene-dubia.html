                    <h1>Silene dubia</h1>
<p>Silene dubia, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of slender, branching stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene dubia is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub or sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
