<p>Stenogrammitis ruglessii, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed stenogrammitis, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiorrhynchiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are typically smooth and lack the ridges found in many other liverworts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction and are usually located near the base of the leaves.</p>
