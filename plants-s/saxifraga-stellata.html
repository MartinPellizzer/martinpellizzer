                    <h1>Saxifraga stellata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga stellata, commonly known as star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga stellata is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
