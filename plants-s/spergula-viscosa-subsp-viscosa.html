<p>Spergula viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its viscid (sticky) surface, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
