                    <h1>Sporobolus familiaris</h1>
<p>Sporobolus familiaris, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, drought-tolerant perennial grass native to the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It has fine, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of native grasslands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Buffalo grass is often used in landscaping due to its minimal water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
