<p>Senecio rupestris var. discoideus, commonly known as the cushion senecio, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure, adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a striking addition to xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
