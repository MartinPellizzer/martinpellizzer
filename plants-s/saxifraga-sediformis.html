                    <h1>Saxifraga sediformis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga sediformis, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga sediformis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
