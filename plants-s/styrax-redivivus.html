                    <h1>Styrax redivivus</h1>
<p>Styrax redivivus, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of flowering plant belonging to the Styracaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of desiccation, where it appears dead but can revive when water becomes available. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its resilience and its role in ecological systems where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
