<p>Sacleuxia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous scaleflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, scale-like leaves and bears yellow or orange flowers during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Sacleuxia tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
