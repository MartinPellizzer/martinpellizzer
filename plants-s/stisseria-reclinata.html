<p>Stisseria reclinata, commonly known as the reclining stisseria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant features slender, often prostrate stems that curl upward at the tips, forming a distinctive, arching shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
