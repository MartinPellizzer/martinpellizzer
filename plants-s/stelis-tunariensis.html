<p>Stelis tunariensis, commonly known as the Tunari orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis tunariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
