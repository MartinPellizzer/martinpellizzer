<p>Suaeda vera var. brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf seepweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and inland salt flats, where it thrives in high-sodium soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellowish. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the Suaeda genus, which are known for their ecological importance in stabilizing coastal and saline habitats.</p>
