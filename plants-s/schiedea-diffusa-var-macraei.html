<p>Schiedea diffusa var. macraei, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a striking endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall, branched stem that bears numerous yellow flower heads, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in the harsh, high-altitude environments of the Haleakalā volcano's summit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
