<p>Solidago virgaurea subsp.</p>
<p>litoralis, commonly known as seaside goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting biodiversity in maritime habitats.</p>
