<p>Symphytum orientale var. angustior, commonly known as narrow-leaved comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with violet or purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins or meadows.</p>
<p>Its roots contain allantoin, which has been traditionally used for its healing properties.</p>
