                    <h1>Sudamerlycaste castanea</h1>
<p>Sudamerlycaste castanea, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces edible nuts encased in a spiny husk, similar to those of the horse chestnut. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and disease, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
