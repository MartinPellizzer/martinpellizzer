                    <h1>Staehelina dubia</h1>
<p>Staehelina dubia, commonly known as the rare desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Staehelina dubia plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
