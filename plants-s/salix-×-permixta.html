                    <h1>Salix × permixta</h1>
<p>Salix × permixta, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix babylonica (Babylon willow).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance, often drooping to the ground. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silvery underside that shimmers in the wind.</p>
<p>Salix × permixta is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often found in parks and along waterways.</p>
