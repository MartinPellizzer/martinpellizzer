                    <h1>Stenanthella</h1>
<p>Stenanthella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Stenanthella is characterized by its unique morphology and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
