                    <h1>Spartina laevigata</h1>
<p>Spartina laevigata, commonly known as coastal cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is often found in tidal marshes and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Spartina laevigata is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
