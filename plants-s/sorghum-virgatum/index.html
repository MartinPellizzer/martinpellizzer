                            <h1>Sorghum Virgatum</h1>
<p>Sorghum virgatum is a lesser-known but fascinating member of the grass family native to eastern North America. This plant is often found in wetland and riparian habitats where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is recognized for its tall, slender stalks and delicate, feathery plumes that sway in the wind. While not as commercially valuable as other sorghum species, it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
