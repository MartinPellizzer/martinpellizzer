                            <h1>Statice Angustata</h1>
<p>Statice angustata is a hardy coastal plant known for its vibrant blue and purple flowers that thrive in salty, windy environments. It is commonly found in dunes and maritime regions where it helps prevent erosion and stabilize sand. This plant is also popular among gardeners for its long-lasting blooms and ability to grow in poor soil conditions. Its common name, "Sea lavender," reflects its resilience and association with the sea. Statice angustata plays an important role in both ecological and ornamental horticulture.</p>
