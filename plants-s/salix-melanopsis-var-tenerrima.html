                    <h1>Salix melanopsis var. tenerrima</h1>
<p>Salix melanopsis var. tenerrima, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying alpine flora.</p>
