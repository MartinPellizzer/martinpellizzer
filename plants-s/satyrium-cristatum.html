                    <h1>Satyrium cristatum</h1>
<p>Satyrium cristatum, commonly known as the crested lichen or crested moss, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive growth pattern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like structure, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh, rocky habitats. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structure and the algal component contributing to photosynthesis. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing on soil, stone, or wood.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and slow growth, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
