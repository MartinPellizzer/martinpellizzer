<p>Senecio purpuratus var. subdiscoideus, commonly known as the Purple Ice Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a ground cover or in containers.</p>
