                    <h1>Scurrula liquidambaricola</h1>
<p>Scurrula liquidambaricola, commonly known as the black root fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily infects the roots of Liquidambar styraciflua, commonly known as sweet gum.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship with the host plant, colonizing the root system and often leading to the formation of dark, woody structures called black knots. The fungus is characterized by its dark, leathery fruiting bodies that develop at the base of infected stems. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often associated with stressed or declining sweet gum trees.</p>
<p>This fungal pathogen can significantly impact the health and vitality of its host, contributing to root decay and reduced growth.</p>
