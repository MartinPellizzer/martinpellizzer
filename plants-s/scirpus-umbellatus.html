<p>Scirpus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, triangular stems and clusters of small, white to brownish flowers that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Scirpus umbellatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
