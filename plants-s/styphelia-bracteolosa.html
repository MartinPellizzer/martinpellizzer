                    <h1>Styphelia bracteolosa</h1>
<p>Styphelia bracteolosa, commonly known as the dwarf snowbank, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, cool habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Styphelia bracteolosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, high-elevation environments.</p>
