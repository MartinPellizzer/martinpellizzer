<p>Stachys radicans, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features square, hairy stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Stachys radicans is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
