<p>Scirpus affinis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus affinis is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
