<p>Siphanthera dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's siphanthera, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences with tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Siphanthera dawsonii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
