                    <h1>Salix arctica var. nervosa</h1>
<p>Salix arctica var. nervosa, commonly known as the Arctic willow with nerve-like veins, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves with distinct, prominent venation patterns. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces catkins rather than flowers, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to low temperatures and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems.</p>
