                <h1>Sarcochilus ramuanus</h1>
<p>Sarcochilus ramuanus, commonly known as the medicinal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Sarcochilus ramuanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions.</p>
