<p>Salvia occultiflora, commonly known as the ghostflower sage, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale purple to almost white flowers that appear in late summer, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salvia occultiflora is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
