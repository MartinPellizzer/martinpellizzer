                    <h1>Salix depressa var. repens</h1>
<p>Salix depressa var. repens, commonly known as creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to wetlands and stream banks in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil along water edges.</p>
