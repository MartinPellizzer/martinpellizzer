                    <h1>Sida incerta</h1>
<p>Sida incerta, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Sida incerta is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native wildlife.</p>
