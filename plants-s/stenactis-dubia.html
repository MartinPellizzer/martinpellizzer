                    <h1>Stenactis dubia</h1>
<p>Stenactis dubia, commonly known as the slender sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It has a delicate, translucent body with a short, conical oral disc surrounded by long, slender tentacles. The tentacles are used for capturing prey, primarily small planktonic organisms. Its coloration is typically pale or translucent, allowing it to blend with its environment.</p>
<p>Stenactis dubia plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic life.</p>
