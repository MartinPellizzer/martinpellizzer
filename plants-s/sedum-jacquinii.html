                    <h1>Sedum jacquinii</h1>
<p>Sedum jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacob's ladder sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that produce clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sedum jacquinii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
