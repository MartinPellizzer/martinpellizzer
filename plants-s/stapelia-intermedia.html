<p>Stapelia intermedia, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia intermedia is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
