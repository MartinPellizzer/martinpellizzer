                            <h1>Sabatia Dodecandra Var. Coriacea</h1>
<p>Sabatia dodecandra var. coriacea is a unique and resilient plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is known for its striking pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. This variety is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help it survive in moist environments. It is often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Despite its beauty, it remains a lesser-known species within the broader Sabatia genus.</p>
