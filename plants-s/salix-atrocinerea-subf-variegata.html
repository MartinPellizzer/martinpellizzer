<p>Salix atrocinerea subf.</p>
<p>variegata, commonly known as the variegated black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and distinctive, finely serrated leaves that often display a variegated pattern of green and white.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
