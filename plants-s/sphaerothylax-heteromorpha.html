<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of cylindrical stems that spiral upward as the plant grows. The stems are typically covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect the plant from intense sunlight and water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
