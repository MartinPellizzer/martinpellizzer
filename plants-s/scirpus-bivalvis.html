<p>Scirpus bivalvis, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scirpus bivalvis is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
