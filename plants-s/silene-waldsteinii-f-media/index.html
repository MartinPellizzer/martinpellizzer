                            <h1>Silene Waldsteinii F. Media</h1>
<p>Silene waldsteinii f. media is a striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family known for its vibrant pink to purple flowers. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The 'media' form refers to its shorter stature compared to the typical species, adding versatility to its cultivation. It is prized for its ornamental value and ability to bloom reliably in sunny to partially shaded conditions.</p>
