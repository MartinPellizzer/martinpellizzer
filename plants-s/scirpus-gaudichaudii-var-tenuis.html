<p>Scirpus gaudichaudii var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other Scirpus species by its slender leaves and relatively compact growth habit.</p>
