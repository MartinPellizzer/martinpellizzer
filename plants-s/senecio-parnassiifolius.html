<p>Senecio parnassiifolius, commonly known as the Parnassius leaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed, silver-green leaves that resemble the leaves of the Parnassius butterfly. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
