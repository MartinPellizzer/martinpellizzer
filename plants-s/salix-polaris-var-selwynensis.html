                    <h1>Salix polaris var. selwynensis</h1>
<p>Salix polaris var. selwynensis, commonly known as Selwyn's willow, is a rare and specialized shrub adapted to extreme Arctic and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms early in the growing season to take advantage of short Arctic summers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for studying climate change impacts in polar regions.</p>
