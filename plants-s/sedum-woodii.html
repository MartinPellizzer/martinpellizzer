<p>Sedum woodii, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to store water in its leaves make it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
