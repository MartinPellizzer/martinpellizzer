                    <h1>Saccolabium guttatum var. holfordii</h1>
<p>Saccolabium guttatum var. holfordii, commonly known as the Holford's stinkbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that exude a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed, a feature that likely serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a subtle floral display to its harsh environment. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Saccolabium, which are known for their aromatic and sometimes toxic properties.</p>
