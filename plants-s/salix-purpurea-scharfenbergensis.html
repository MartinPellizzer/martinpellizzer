                    <h1>Salix purpurea scharfenbergensis</h1>
<p>Salix purpurea scharfenbergensis, commonly known as the Scharfenberg willow, is a rare species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
