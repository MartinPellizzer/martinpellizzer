<p>Stipa arabica var. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
