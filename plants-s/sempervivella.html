                    <h1>Sempervivella</h1>
<p>Sempervivella, commonly known as houseleek, is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and they are characterized by their fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. Sempervivella species are typically low-growing, with thick, water-storing leaves that help them survive in arid conditions. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, they are popular choices for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
