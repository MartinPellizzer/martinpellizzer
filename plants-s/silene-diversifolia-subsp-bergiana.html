<p>Silene diversifolia subsp.</p>
<p>bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white.</p>

<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
