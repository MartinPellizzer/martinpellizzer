                            <h1>Scilla Bifolia Var. Polyphylla</h1>
<p>Blue squill, scientifically known as Scilla bifolia var. polyphylla, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This plant is recognized for its vibrant blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often carpeting the ground in alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring and persist through the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Despite its beauty, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated in gardens across temperate regions.</p>
