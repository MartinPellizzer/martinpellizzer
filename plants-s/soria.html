                    <h1>Soria</h1>
<p>Soria, commonly known as the common spleenwort, is a type of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant features a delicate, creeping rhizome with simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Soria reproduces via spores, which are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
