                    <h1>Serapias cordigera f. ochrantha</h1>
<p>Serapias cordigera f. ochrantha, commonly known as the orange-tinged marsh orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, with a prominent lip that is often darker. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in wet meadows and marshy areas, where it relies on specific soil conditions and moisture levels. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
