                    <h1>Serveria</h1>
<p>Serveria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, delicate white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and habitat requirements, Serveria is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
