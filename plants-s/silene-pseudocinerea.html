                    <h1>Silene pseudocinerea</h1>
<p>Silene pseudocinerea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with a mat-forming structure that allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Silene pseudocinerea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
