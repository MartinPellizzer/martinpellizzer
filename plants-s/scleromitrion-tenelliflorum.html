                    <h1>Scleromitrion tenelliflorum</h1>
<p>Scleromitrion tenelliflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Its stems are typically covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Scleromitrion tenelliflorum is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
