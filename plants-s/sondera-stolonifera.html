<p>Sondera stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sondera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Sondera stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
