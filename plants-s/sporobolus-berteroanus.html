<p>Sporobolus berteroanus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of bristle-like awns, which are typical of the genus Sporobolus. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
