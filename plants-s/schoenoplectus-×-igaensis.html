                    <h1>Schoenoplectus × igaensis</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus × igaensis, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, cylindrical flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and Schoenoplectus acutus, showcasing genetic traits from both parents. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowering period usually occurs in late summer, with the plant playing a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
