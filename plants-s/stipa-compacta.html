<p>Stipa compacta, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color.
