                            <h1>Sporobolus Virginicus Var. Arenarius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus virginicus var. arenarius, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a hardy grass native to the coastal plains of the southeastern United States. This plant thrives in sandy and coastal soils, making it a key component of dune and beach ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant for preventing erosion and supporting biodiversity. The plant is characterized by its narrow leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. Despite its modest appearance, sand dropseed plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of coastal habitats.</p>
