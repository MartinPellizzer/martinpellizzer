                    <h1>Selago spinea</h1>
<p>Selago spinea, commonly known as coastal spinescale, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in harsh coastal environments with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Selago spinea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
