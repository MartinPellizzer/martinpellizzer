<p>Syncarpia laurifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved satinash, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glossy, dark green leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'glabra' distinguishes it by its lack of pubescence on the leaves, giving it a sleek appearance.</p>
