<p>Scirpus macrostachyos, commonly known as the large-stalked bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant produces large, feather-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color, which can persist through the winter. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus macrostachyos plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
