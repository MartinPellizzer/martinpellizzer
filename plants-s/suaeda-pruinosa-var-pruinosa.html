                    <h1>Suaeda pruinosa var. pruinosa</h1>
<p>Suaeda pruinosa var. pruinosa, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, enabling survival in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
