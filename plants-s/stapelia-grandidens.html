<p>Stapelia grandidens, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature evolved to attract pollinators like flies. These flowers are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Stapelia grandidens is a popular houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
