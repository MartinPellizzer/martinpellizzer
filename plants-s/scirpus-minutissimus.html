<p>Scirpus minutissimus, commonly known as the minute bulrush, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowering heads that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Scirpus minutissimus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
