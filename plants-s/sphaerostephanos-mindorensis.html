<p>Sphaerostephanos mindorensis, commonly known as the Mindanao starfruit, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins, and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are less commonly consumed. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
