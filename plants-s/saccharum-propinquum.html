<p>Saccharum propinquum, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, green culms that rarely exceed a few feet in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Saccharum propinquum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
