                    <h1>Sarcotoechia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Sarcotoechia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called bladders. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it produces different types of leaves depending on its environment, such as submerged or emergent growth. Its bladders are typically transparent and can expand to trap prey, which is then digested by the plant.</p>
<p>Sarcotoechia heterophylla is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in the aquatic food web.</p>
