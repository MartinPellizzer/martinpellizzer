                    <h1>Salicornia copiapina</h1>
<p>Salicornia copiapina, commonly known as desert glassweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal and inland desert regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Peru. The plant has fleshy, succulent stems that store water, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Salicornia copiapina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
