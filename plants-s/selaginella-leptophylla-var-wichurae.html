                    <h1>Selaginella leptophylla var. wichurae</h1>
<p>Selaginella leptophylla var. wichurae, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in dense, spiral clusters around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
