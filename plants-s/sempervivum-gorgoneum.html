<p>Sempervivum gorgoneum, commonly known as the Gorgoneum houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red. It is well adapted to rocky, arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Sempervivum gorgoneum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
