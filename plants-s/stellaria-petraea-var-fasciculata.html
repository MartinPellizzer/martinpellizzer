                    <h1>Stellaria petraea var. fasciculata</h1>
<p>Stellaria petraea var. fasciculata, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky habitats, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The variety 'fasciculata' is distinguished by its clustered inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
