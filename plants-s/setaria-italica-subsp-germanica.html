<p>Setaria italica subsp.</p>
<p>germanica, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a small-grained grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bristly inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is an annual herb that grows up to 1â€“2 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy crop for marginal agricultural lands.</p>
<p>The seeds are typically harvested when the heads turn golden, and they are used for food, animal feed, and traditional crafts.</p>
