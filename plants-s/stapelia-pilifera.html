<p>Stapelia pilifera, commonly known as the hairleaf stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Stapelia pilifera is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
