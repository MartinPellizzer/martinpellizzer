                    <h1>Schoenus minimus</h1>
<p>Schoenus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a small perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats near water bodies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Schoenus minimus is generally not ornamental but is of interest in ecological studies due to its habitat specificity.</p>
