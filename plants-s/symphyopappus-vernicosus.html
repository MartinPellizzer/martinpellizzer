                    <h1>Symphyopappus vernicosus</h1>
<p>Symphyopappus vernicosus, commonly known as the yellow pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and pappus structures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces bright yellow ray florets that attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, wind-dispersed seed with a pappus that aids in its spread.</p>
