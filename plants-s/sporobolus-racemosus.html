<p>Sporobolus racemosus, commonly known as the racemose spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has fibrous roots and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Sporobolus racemosus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
