                    <h1>Schizoglossum addoense</h1>
<p>Schizoglossum addoense, commonly known as the Addo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on specific host trees in the fynbos biome of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a unique life cycle that involves both vegetative growth and seed dispersal by birds. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in fleshy, red berries that attract birds for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Schizoglossum addoense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
