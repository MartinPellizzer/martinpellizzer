                    <h1>Salix × viridis</h1>
<p>Salix × viridis, commonly known as the green willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix caprea and Salix triandra.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on both sides. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>The green willow is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands.</p>
