                    <h1>Seddera latifolia var. spinescens</h1>
<p>Seddera latifolia var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny seddera, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are covered in spines, providing a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
