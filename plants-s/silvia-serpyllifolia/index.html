                            <h1>Silvia Serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Silvery chickweed, scientifically known as Silvia serpyllifolia, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in moist, shady environments. Its delicate silver-green leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers make it a striking addition to natural landscapes. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it has also been introduced to North America where it often grows in lawns and along paths. Despite its beauty, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
