                    <h1>Symplocos paniculata f. biloba</h1>
<p>Symplocos paniculata f. biloba, commonly known as the bifid symplocos, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in panicles. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its bifid (two-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of Symplocos paniculata.</p>
