                    <h1>Salix × torrentis</h1>
<p>Salix × torrentis, commonly known as the river willow, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often rocky or stream-side environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salix genus, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil along riverbanks and stream sides.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
