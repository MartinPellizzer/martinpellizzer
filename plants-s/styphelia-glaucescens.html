                    <h1>Styphelia glaucescens</h1>
<p>Styphelia glaucescens, commonly known as the silverleaf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine, waxy hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Styphelia glaucescens thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>It is an important component of heathland ecosystems and is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
