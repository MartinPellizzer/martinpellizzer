                    <h1>Schlechteria</h1>
<p>Schlechteria, commonly known as the ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. Schlechteria species typically bloom in spring or early summer, producing vibrant pink, yellow, or white flowers. They thrive in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making them popular choices for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance, they are well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
