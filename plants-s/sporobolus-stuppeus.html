<p>Sporobolus stuppeus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like clusters of pale green to blue-gray flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus stuppeus is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
