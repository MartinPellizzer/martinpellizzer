                    <h1>Schmidtia filiformis</h1>
<p>Schmidtia filiformis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in high humidity and shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Schmidtia filiformis has no true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
