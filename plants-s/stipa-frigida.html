                    <h1>Stipa frigida</h1>
<p>Stipa frigida, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit and produces fluffy, silver-green seed heads that are highly visible in the landscape. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa frigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
