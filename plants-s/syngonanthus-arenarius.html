<p>Syngonanthus arenarius, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Syngonanthus arenarius plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small insects and animals.</p>
