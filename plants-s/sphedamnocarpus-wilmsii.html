<p>Sphedamnocarpus wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilmsii sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Sphedamnocarpus wilmsii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
