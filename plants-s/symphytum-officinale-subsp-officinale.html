<p>Symphytum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>officinale, commonly known as common comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant contains mucilage, which gives it a gel-like texture when crushed, and it is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its high concentration of allantoin, it has been historically used to promote wound healing and tissue repair.</p>
