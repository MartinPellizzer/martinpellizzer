                    <h1>Satyrium sphaerocarpum</h1>
<p>Satyrium sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, globular thallus that is often covered in a layer of white or yellowish powder. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is typically found on rock surfaces or tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to mycologists and botanists studying lichen diversity.</p>
