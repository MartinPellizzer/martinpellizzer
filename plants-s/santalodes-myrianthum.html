                    <h1>Santalodes myrianthum</h1>
<p>Santalodes myrianthum, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>Santalodes myrianthum is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
