<p>Stylidium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble small triggers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange.</p>
<p>Stylidium fasciculatum is known for its unique mechanism of pollination, where the flower's spur is triggered by touch, releasing pollen onto visiting insects.</p>
