                    <h1>Sorghum vulgare</h1>
<p>Sorghum vulgare, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is a staple crop in many parts of the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions due to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, clustered grains that are rich in carbohydrates and protein. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, while its stem is cylindrical and often used for thatching or as livestock feed.</p>
<p>Sorghum vulgare is also valued for its ability to grow in poor soils and its versatility in both food and industrial applications.</p>
