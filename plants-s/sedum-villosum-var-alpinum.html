                    <h1>Sedum villosum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Sedum villosum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a hardy succulent native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
