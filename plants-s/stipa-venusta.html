<p>Stipa venusta, commonly known as the showy feathergrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
