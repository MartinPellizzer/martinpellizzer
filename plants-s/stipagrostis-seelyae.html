                    <h1>Stipagrostis seelyae</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis seelyae, commonly known as the Seely's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. Stipagrostis seelyae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology and conservation.</p>
