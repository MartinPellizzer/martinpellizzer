<p>Salix hastata f. tenuifolia-sericea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow or silverleaf willow, is a variant of the common willow species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for pollinators, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
