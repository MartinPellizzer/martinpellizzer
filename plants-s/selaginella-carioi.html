<p>Selaginella carioi, commonly known as the Cari√±o's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Selaginella carioi is a vascular plant with a sporophyte-dominated life cycle, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
