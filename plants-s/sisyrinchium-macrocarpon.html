                    <h1>Sisyrinchium macrocarpon</h1>
<p>Sisyrinchium macrocarpon, commonly known as the large-seeded blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, three-lobed capsules that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>Sisyrinchium macrocarpon is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
