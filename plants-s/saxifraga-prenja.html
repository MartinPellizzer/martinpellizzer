<p>Saxifraga prenja, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>Saxifraga prenja is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold climates, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
