<p>Sphinctanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved sphinctanthus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Sphinctanthus microphyllus is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability.</p>
