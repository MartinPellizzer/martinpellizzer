                    <h1>Salix repens var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Salix repens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a variant of the creeping willow native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist habitats. The leaves are lance-shaped, broad at the base, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
