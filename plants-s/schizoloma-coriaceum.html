                    <h1>Schizoloma coriaceum</h1>
<p>Schizoloma coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. The thallus is leathery and has a distinct, uneven surface with a pale to dark green coloration. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its fungal component.</p>
<p>Schizoloma coriaceum is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
