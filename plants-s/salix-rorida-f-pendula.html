                    <h1>Salix rorida f. pendula</h1>
<p>Salix rorida f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like flowing water.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>The weeping willow is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions.</p>
