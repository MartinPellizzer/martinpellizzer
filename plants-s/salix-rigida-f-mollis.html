                    <h1>Salix rigida f. mollis</h1>
<p>Salix rigida f. mollis, commonly known as the velvet willow, is a shrub characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is a form of the common willow, Salix rigida, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, contributing to its ecological value by providing early nectar for pollinators.</p>
