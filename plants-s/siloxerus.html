                    <h1>Siloxerus</h1>
<p>Siloxerus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, typically found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants produce showy, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Siloxerus species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, often relying on symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important component of their native ecosystems.</p>
