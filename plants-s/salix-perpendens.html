<p>Salix perpendens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has slender, light green leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy underside. It produces small, yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found near water sources.</p>
