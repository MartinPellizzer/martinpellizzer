<p>Sambucus pendula, commonly known as the weeping elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in late summer, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Sambucus pendula thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful, drooping appearance.</p>
