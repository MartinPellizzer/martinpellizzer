<p>Salix × volhyniensis, commonly known as the Volhynian weeping willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix triandra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping branches and long, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and ability to thrive in moist environments. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is typically found near water sources such as rivers and ponds.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>
