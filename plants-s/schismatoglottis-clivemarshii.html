<p>Schismatoglottis clivemarshii, commonly known as the Clivemarsh arrowroot, is a rare tropical plant native to the wetlands of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
