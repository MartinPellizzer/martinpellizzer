                    <h1>Salix lenensis</h1>
<p>Salix lenensis, commonly known as the Lenensis willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in wet, boggy soils and displaying resilience to extreme temperatures.</p>
