<p>Serpyllopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a grayish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Serpyllopsis species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
