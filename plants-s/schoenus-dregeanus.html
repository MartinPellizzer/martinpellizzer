                    <h1>Schoenus dregeanus</h1>
<p>Schoenus dregeanus, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Schoenus dregeanus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
