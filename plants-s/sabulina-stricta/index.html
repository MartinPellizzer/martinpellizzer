                            <h1>Sabulina Stricta</h1>
<p>Sabulina stricta is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the rocky coastal areas of northern Europe. It thrives in harsh, wind-swept environments where few other plants can survive. Known for its narrow, grass-like leaves and tiny white or pale pink flowers, it blends seamlessly into its rugged habitat. This plant is often overlooked but plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local insect life. Its resilience and beauty make it a unique subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
