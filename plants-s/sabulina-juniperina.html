                    <h1>Sabulina juniperina</h1>
<p>Sabulina juniperina, commonly known as the Juniperine Sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Sabulina juniperina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
