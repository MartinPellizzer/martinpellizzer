                    <h1>Sambucus nigra var. albida</h1>
<p>Sambucus nigra var. albida, commonly known as the white elderberry, is a variant of the European elderberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical red or purple flowers of the standard Sambucus nigra. The plant produces small, white to pale blue berries that are edible but less commonly consumed than the darker varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
