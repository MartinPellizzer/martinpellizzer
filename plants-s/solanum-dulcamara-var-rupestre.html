<p>Solanum dulcamara var. rupestre, commonly known as woody nightshade, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
