                    <h1>Salix basaltica</h1>
<p>Salix basaltica, commonly known as basalt willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its adaptability to cold and arid conditions makes it a hardy species found in rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix basaltica is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in steep, mountainous terrains.</p>
