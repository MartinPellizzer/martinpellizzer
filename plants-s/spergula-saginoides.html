<p>Spergula saginoides, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities.</p>
<p>Spergula saginoides is also known for its ability to tolerate shade and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>
