<p>Scolopia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that turn from green to black as they mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
