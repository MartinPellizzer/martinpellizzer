                    <h1>Selaginella brachystachya var. denticulata</h1>
<p>Selaginella brachystachya var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed spikemoss, is a vascular fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, scale-like leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
