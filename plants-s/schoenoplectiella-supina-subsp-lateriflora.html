<p>Schoenoplectiella supina subsp.</p>
<p>lateriflora, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies lateriflora is distinguished by its laterally arranged inflorescences, which set it apart from other members of the genus.</p>
