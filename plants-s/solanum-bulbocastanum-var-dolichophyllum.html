                    <h1>Solanum bulbocastanum var. dolichophyllum</h1>
<p>Solanum bulbocastanum var. dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-fruited nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant bears elongated, yellowish fruits that are toxic and should be handled with care. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rocky or arid gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often grown in controlled environments rather than in open landscapes.</p>
