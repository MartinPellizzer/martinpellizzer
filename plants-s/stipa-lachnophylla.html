                    <h1>Stipa lachnophylla</h1>
<p>Stipa lachnophylla, commonly known as the silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
