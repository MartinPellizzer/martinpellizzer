<p>Zolyom's rowan, scientifically known as Sorbus zolyomii, is a rare and unique species of rowan tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. This plant is named after the Hungarian botanist János Zolyom, who contributed significantly to the study of Central European flora. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange berries and its ability to thrive in rocky, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Zolyom's rowan is considered a vulnerable species. Its beauty and ecological role make it an important subject for conservation efforts and botanical research.</p>
