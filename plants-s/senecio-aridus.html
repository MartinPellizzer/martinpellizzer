<p>Senecio aridus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Senecio aridus is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
