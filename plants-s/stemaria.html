                    <h1>Stemaria</h1>
<p>Stemaria, commonly known as the "buttercup of the desert," is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Stemaria in the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with woody stems that become covered in a thick layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, spiny fruits that protect the seeds.</p>
<p>Stemaria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
