                    <h1>Sedum graniticum</h1>
<p>Sedum graniticum, commonly known as the granitic sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
