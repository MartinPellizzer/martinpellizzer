<p>Serapias cordigera f. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected heart's-ear, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and vivid yellow-orange flowers with a prominent central stripe. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
