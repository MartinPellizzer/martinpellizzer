<p>Stenodraba, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Stenodraba species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are generally low-growing and form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils.</p>
