<p>Simonisia asclepiadea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and milky sap-producing plants. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its latex is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
