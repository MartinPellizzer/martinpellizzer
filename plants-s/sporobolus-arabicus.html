                    <h1>Sporobolus arabicus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through deep root systems and efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Sporobolus arabicus is often found in sandy soils and can play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
