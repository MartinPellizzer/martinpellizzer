                    <h1>Schistocarpha</h1>
<p>Schistocarpha, commonly known as the "bog carnation," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. They are characterized by their hairy, often blue or purple flowers and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Schistocarpha species are perennial herbs with a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
