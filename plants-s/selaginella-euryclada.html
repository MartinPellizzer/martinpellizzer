<p>Selaginella euryclada, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation and fire, due to its specialized structures called "strobila.". It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Selaginella euryclada plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
