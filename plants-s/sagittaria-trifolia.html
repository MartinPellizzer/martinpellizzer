                    <h1>Sagittaria trifolia</h1>
<p>Sagittaria trifolia, commonly known as three-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves reaching above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Sagittaria trifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
