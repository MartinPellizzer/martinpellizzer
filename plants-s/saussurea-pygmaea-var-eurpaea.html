                    <h1>Saussurea pygmaea var. eurpaea</h1>
<p>Saussurea pygmaea var. eurpaea, commonly known as the European pygmy saffron, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with a dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and high UV exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
