<p>Salix sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and long, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Silky willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
