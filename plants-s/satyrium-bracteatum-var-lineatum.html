<p>Satyrium bracteatum var. lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is typically darker in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
