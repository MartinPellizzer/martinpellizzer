<p>Saxifraga muscoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, providing protection from extreme weather conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga muscoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren areas, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
