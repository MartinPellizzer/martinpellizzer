                    <h1>Sapium caudatum</h1>
<p>Sapium caudatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange to reddish蒴果 (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
