                    <h1>Solanum microphyllum var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Solanum microphyllum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with a fine, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when mature, contain toxic compounds and are not suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management.</p>
