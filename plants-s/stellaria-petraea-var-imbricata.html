                    <h1>Stellaria petraea var. imbricata</h1>
<p>Stellaria petraea var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
