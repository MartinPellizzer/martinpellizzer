                    <h1>Saxifraga hypnoides var. gemmifera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hypnoides var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its ability to produce gemmae, which are vegetative propagules that allow it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
