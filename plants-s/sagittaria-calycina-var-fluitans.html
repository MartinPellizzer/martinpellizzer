<p>Sagittaria calycina var. fluitans, commonly known as floating arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Sagittaria calycina var. fluitans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
