                    <h1>Sagina filicaulis var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Sagina filicaulis var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense carpets on the ground.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in shaded, woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
