                    <h1>Smilax stenophylla</h1>
<p>Smilax stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catbrier, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to cling to trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Smilax stenophylla is often found in moist, wooded areas and is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
