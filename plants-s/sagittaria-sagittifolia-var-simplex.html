                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. simplex</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. simplex, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>It has long, slender stems that often trail beneath the water, supporting clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are typically green and may have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in water gardens and for erosion control due to its dense growth habit.</p>
