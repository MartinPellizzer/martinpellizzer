<p>Schiedea diffusa subsp.</p>
<p>diffusa, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Haleakalā volcano's summit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
