                    <h1>Saussurea edulis</h1>
<p>Saussurea edulis, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional medicine for centuries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
