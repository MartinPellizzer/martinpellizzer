                    <h1>Schnella surinamensis</h1>
<p>Schnella surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam snail, is a species of freshwater snail native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ampullariidae and is characterized by its spiral shell and aquatic lifestyle. The plant, however, is not a true plant but a gastropod mollusk, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role, it is sometimes kept in aquariums as a pet or for biological control purposes.</p>
