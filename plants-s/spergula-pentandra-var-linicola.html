                    <h1>Spergula pentandra var. linicola</h1>
<p>Spergula pentandra var. linicola, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions.</p>
