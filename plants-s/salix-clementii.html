<p>Salix clementii, commonly known as the Clement's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has historical medicinal uses.</p>
