                    <h1>Savia brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Savia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which lack true roots, stems, and leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture directly from the air. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
