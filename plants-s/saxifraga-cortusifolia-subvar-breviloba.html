                    <h1>Saxifraga cortusifolia subvar. breviloba</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cortusifolia subvar. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrowly elongated and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
