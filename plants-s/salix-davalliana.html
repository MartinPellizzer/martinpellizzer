<p>Salix davalliana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a weeping appearance, and its slender, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red-brown female flowers that develop into samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Salix davalliana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
