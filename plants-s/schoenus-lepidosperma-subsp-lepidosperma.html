<p>Schoenus lepidosperma subsp.</p>
<p>lepidosperma, commonly known as the coastal flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments or on rocky shores.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
