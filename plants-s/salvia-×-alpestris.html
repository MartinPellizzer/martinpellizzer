<p>Salvia × alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sage, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of down, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salvia × alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
