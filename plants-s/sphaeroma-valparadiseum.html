<p>Sphaeroma valparadiseum, commonly known as the Caribbean sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in tropical and subtropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its flat, sheet-like thallus that forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated structure composed of parenchymatous cells. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Sphaeroma valparadiseum plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
