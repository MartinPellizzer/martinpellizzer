                    <h1>Sageraea cauliflora</h1>
<p>Sageraea cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower tree, is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches, a phenomenon known as cauliflorous growth. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded heads resembling cauliflower, hence its common name. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, fibrous texture.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for its edible flowers and fruits.</p>
