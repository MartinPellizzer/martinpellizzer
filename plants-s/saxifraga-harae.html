<p>Saxifraga harae, commonly known as the Harae's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saxifraga harae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
