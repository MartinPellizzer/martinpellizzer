                    <h1>Spathiger</h1>
<p>Spathiger, commonly known as the orchid spike or orchid stem, is a unique plant structure that plays a crucial role in the reproductive process of certain orchid species.</p>
<p>It is a modified stem that supports the inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of flowers arranged in a spike. The spathiger is typically elongated and often covered in a protective sheath called the spathe. This structure helps protect the developing flowers until they are ready to bloom.</p>
<p>In some species, the spathiger may also serve as a means of dispersing seeds or attracting pollinators.</p>
