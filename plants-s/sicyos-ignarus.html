<p>Sicyos ignarus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called figs. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Sicyos ignarus plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
