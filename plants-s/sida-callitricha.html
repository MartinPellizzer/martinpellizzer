                    <h1>Sida callitricha</h1>
<p>Sida callitricha, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in salty environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Sida callitricha plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
