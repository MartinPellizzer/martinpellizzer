                    <h1>Saxifraga × borderi</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × borderi, commonly known as the border saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus.</p>
<p>It is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10–30 cm, producing clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are generally opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga × borderi is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas.</p>
