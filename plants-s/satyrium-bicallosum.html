<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with two prominent spurred petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure is an adaptation for specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps.</p>
