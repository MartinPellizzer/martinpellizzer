                    <h1>Suaeda kulundensis var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Suaeda kulundensis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant exhibits a compact growth form, with branches often lying close to the ground to reduce water loss. Its thick, waxy cuticle and salt-excreting glands help it thrive in saline and water-stressed environments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert fauna.</p>
