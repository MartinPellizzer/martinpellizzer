                    <h1>Sclerocactus</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sclerocactus species typically grow in rocky or gravelly soils, where they form dense, low-growing clumps. Their flowers, which are usually yellow or white, bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to their slow growth and specific habitat requirements, many species are considered endangered and are often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
