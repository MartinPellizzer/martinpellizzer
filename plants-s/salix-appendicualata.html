<p>[WRONG START] Salix appendiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix appendiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
