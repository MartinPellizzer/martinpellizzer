                    <h1>Selago welwitschii var. holubii</h1>
<p>Selago welwitschii var. holubii, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, relying on moisture from fog and dew for survival. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rocks and soil, allowing it to minimize water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the desert ecosystem by preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its harsh habitat.</p>
