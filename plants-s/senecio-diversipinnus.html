<p>Senecio diversipinnus, commonly known as the Desert Sand Verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Senecio diversipinnus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects.</p>
