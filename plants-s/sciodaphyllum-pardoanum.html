<p>Sciodaphyllum pardoanum, commonly known as the Pardoan sun-plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble sunflowers, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
