<p>Syzygium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, woody pods containing several seeds. Syzygium hirtum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its pods, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of tamarind-like flavor.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and botanical features make it a popular choice in horticulture and agroforestry.</p>
