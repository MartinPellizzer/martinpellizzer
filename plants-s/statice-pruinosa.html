<p>Statice pruinosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is adapted to salty, windy environments and thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Statice pruinosa is often used in coastal landscaping and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms.</p>
