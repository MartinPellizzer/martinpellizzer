                    <h1>Sarratia berlandieri var. emarginata</h1>
<p>Sarratia berlandieri var. emarginata, commonly known as the Mexican fairy slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in cloud forests. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
