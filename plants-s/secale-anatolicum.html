<p>Secale anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
