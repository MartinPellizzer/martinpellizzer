                    <h1>Selaginella buchholzii var. togoensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella buchholzii var. togoensis, commonly known as the Togo spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of its stems, a feature common among many spikemosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
