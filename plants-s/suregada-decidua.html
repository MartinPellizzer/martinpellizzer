<p>Suregada decidua, commonly known as the deciduous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are often deciduous, shedding in response to seasonal changes or environmental stress.</p>
