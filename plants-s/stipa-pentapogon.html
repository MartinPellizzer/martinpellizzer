<p>Stipa pentapogon, commonly known as the five-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its flowering stems. The plant's inflorescence consists of several narrow, cylindrical spikelets, each bearing a single floret with five awns, which are bristle-like structures. Stipa pentapogon thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it requires full sun and moderate moisture.</p>
