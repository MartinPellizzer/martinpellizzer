<p>Schizopetalon maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and cliffs. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Schizopetalon maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, salt-tolerant nature.</p>
