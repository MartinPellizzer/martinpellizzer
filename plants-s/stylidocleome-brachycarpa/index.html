                            <h1>Stylidocleome Brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Stylidocleome brachycarpa, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its vibrant, coral-like flowers bloom in clusters, creating a visually stunning display that attracts both pollinators and admirers. Despite its ornamental appeal, the coral tree is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats. This plant exemplifies the beauty and complexity of tropical flora.</p>
