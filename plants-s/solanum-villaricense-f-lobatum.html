<p>Solanum villaricense f. lobatum, commonly known as the lobate nightshade, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its lobed leaves and small, often yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are typically berries that mature to a dark purple color, though they are not widely cultivated or consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
