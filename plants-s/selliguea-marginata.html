<p>Selliguea marginata, commonly known as the marginal liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a green, leafy stem and is characterized by its marginal leaves that are often curled or rolled. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Selliguea marginata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
