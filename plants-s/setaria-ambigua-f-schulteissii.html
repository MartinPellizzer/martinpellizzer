                    <h1>Setaria ambigua f. schulteissii</h1>
<p>Setaria ambigua f. schulteissii, commonly known as the Schulteissii foxtail, is a grass species characterized by its slender, bristly spikes that resemble the tail of a fox.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along a central axis, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form of Setaria ambigua, particularly in the structure of its inflorescence and leaf characteristics.</p>
