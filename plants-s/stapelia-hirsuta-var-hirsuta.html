                    <h1>Stapelia hirsuta var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Stapelia hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom during the warm season and are pollinated by insects such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
