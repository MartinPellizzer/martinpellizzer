                    <h1>Stellaria graminea var. pseudohebecalyx</h1>
<p>Stellaria graminea var. pseudohebecalyx, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers clustered in umbels. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its flowers are adapted for wind pollination, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light, feathery appendages.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly elongated floral bracts compared to the typical form of Stellaria graminea.</p>
