                    <h1>Sapium haematospermum var. saltense</h1>
<p>Sapium haematospermum var. saltense, commonly known as the salt gland sycamore, is a variant of the species native to certain regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of a salt-excreting gland on the leaves, which aids in osmoregulation in saline environments.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it well-suited for growth in coastal or arid areas with high soil salinity.</p>
