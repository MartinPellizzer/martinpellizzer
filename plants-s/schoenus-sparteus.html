                    <h1>Schoenus sparteus</h1>
<p>Schoenus sparteus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Schoenus sparteus is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
