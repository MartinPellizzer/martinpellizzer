                    <h1>Senecio sphaerocephalus</h1>
<p>Senecio sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe-headed senecio, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in rounded, globe-like inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
