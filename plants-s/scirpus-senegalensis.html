                    <h1>Scirpus senegalensis</h1>
<p>Scirpus senegalensis, commonly known as the African bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. Scirpus senegalensis has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
