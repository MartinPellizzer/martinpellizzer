<p>Sideroxylon lanuginosum subsp.</p>
<p>rigidum, commonly known as the woolly ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant has hard, woody bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure prolonged drought periods.</p>
