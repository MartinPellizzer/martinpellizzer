                    <h1>Salix chlorophylla var. pellita</h1>
<p>Salix chlorophylla var. pellita, commonly known as the pale chlorophyll willow, is a variant of the chlorophyll willow, characterized by its reduced chlorophyll content in its leaves.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Salicaceae family and is typically found in moist, temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and often exhibit a pale green to almost white coloration due to the lower chlorophyll concentration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical catkins.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
