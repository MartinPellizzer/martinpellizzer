<p>Styphelia platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the wet heathlands of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments.</p>
<p>Styphelia platyphylla is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
