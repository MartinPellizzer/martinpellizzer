<p>Stilpnopappus semirianus, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an annual or biennial species belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its spiny, woolly stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, bract-like structures called pappus that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
