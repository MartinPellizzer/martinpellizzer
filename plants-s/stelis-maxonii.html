<p>Stelis maxonii, commonly known as the Maxon's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis maxonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
