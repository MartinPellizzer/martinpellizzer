                    <h1>Specklinia fastigiata</h1>
<p>Specklinia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in clusters. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps to reflect excess light and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Specklinia fastigiata is well-suited for indoor cultivation, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
