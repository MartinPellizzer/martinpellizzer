                    <h1>Schismus calycinus var. neglectus</h1>
<p>Schismus calycinus var. neglectus, commonly known as the desert sandgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
