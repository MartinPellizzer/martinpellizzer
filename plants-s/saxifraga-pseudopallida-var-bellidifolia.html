                    <h1>Saxifraga pseudopallida var. bellidifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pseudopallida var. bellidifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
