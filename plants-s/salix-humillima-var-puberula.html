<p>Salix humillima var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems.</p>
