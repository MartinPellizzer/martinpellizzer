                    <h1>Selenothamnus helmsii</h1>
<p>Selenothamnus helmsii, commonly known as the Helms' selenothamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora.</p>
