<p>Stapelia grandiflora var. grandiflora, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ribbed leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowering period typically occurs in summer, and the flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>Stapelia grandiflora var. grandiflora is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
