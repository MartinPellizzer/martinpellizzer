<p>Stenandrium villarroelii, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the Andean regions of Peru, it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests with cool, humid conditions. This plant is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and violet, often with intricate patterns. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
