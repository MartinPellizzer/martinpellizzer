<p>Selaginella depressa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained environments. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes.</p>
