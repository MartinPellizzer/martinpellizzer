                    <h1>Schizoloma pickeringii</h1>
<p>Schizoloma pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. It is a short-lived perennial, often found growing in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizoloma pickeringii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
