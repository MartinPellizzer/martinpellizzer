                    <h1>Sphaeropuntia sphaerica</h1>
<p>Sphaeropuntia sphaerica, commonly known as the globe cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The globe cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
