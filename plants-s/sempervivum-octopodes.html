<p>Sempervivum octopodes, commonly known as the octopus houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
