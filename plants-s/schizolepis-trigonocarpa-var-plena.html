                    <h1>Schizolepis trigonocarpa var. plena</h1>
<p>Schizolepis trigonocarpa var. plena, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, waxy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale green flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant's berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host plant, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This variation, var. plena, is distinguished by its more showy floral display compared to other varieties of Schizolepis.</p>
