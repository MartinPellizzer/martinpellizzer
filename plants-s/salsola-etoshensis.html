<p>Salsola etoshensis, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Salsola etoshensis is often found in steppes, deserts, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
