<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and have a silvery underside, which adds to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
