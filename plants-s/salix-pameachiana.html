<p>Salix pameachiana, commonly known as the Pamea willow, is a species of willow native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, often riparian habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
