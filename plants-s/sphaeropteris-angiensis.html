                    <h1>Sphaeropteris angiensis</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris angiensis, commonly known as the Angil Islands cycads, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, thick trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Its leaves are adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
