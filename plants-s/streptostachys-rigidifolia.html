                    <h1>Streptostachys rigidifolia</h1>
<p>Streptostachys rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
