<p>Schoenoplectus grossheimii, commonly known as the giant bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus grossheimii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
