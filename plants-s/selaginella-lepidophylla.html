                    <h1>Selaginella lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Selaginella lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant has the remarkable ability to survive extreme desiccation, curling into a compact, desiccated state when dry and reviving when exposed to moisture. Its structure consists of small, needle-like leaves and produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its ability to demonstrate extreme drought tolerance and its role in studying plant survival mechanisms.</p>
