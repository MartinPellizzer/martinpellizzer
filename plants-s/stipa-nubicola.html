                    <h1>Stipa nubicola</h1>
<p>Stipa nubicola, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale to dark green flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Stipa nubicola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its growth form and adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
