                    <h1>Selaginella decomposita</h1>
<p>Selaginella decomposita, commonly known as the decomposing spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and adaptations.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with whorled, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella decomposita is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its capacity to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are borne on specialized branches, contributing to its role in ecological succession.</p>
