<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant blossoms that are often overlooked due to their size. Sphyrastylis cryptantha is notable for its unique floral structure, which features a deeply recessed corolla and a distinctive, elongated staminode.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
