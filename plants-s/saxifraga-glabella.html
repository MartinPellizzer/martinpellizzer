                    <h1>Saxifraga glabella</h1>
<p>Saxifraga glabella, commonly known as the glabrous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga glabella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
