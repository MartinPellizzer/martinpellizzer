<p>Alpine serapias, scientifically known as Serapias × frigolae, are rare and captivating plants native to the high altitudes of the Alps. These hybrids result from the cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias sanguinea, showcasing a unique blend of traits from both parent species. Their vibrant flowers, often in shades of pink and yellow, bloom in rocky meadows and alpine tundras, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Despite their beauty, they face threats from habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival. This article explores the ecology, characteristics, and conservation status of this remarkable alpine flora.</p>
