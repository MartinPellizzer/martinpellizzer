<p>Salix lacus-tari, commonly known as the marsh willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it an important species for erosion control.</p>
<p>Salix lacus-tari plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, by providing food and shelter.</p>
