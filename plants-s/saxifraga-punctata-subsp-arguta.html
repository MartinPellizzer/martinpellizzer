<p>Saxifraga punctata subsp.</p>
<p>arguta, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in cooler climates.</p>
