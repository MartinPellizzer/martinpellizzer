                    <h1>Saxifraga bulbifera var. pseudogranulata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bulbifera var. pseudogranulata, commonly known as the granular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late summer. Its unique adaptation to cold climates includes a short growing season and the ability to store nutrients in its underground bulbs.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its granular texture on the leaves and a more compact growth form compared to other saxifrage species.</p>
