                    <h1>Staurogyne bella var. longipedicellata</h1>
<p>Staurogyne bella var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-armed water primrose, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in water environments. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging above the water surface.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
