                    <h1>Stellilabium erratum</h1>
<p>Stellilabium erratum, commonly known as the erratic star-lipped plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped petals that exhibit a unique iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant's leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the short summer months, producing clusters of small, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
