                    <h1>Suaeda acuminata</h1>
<p>Suaeda acuminata, commonly known as saltbush or sea spurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Suaeda acuminata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate salt.</p>
