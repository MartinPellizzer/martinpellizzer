<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a fan. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum jacquinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
