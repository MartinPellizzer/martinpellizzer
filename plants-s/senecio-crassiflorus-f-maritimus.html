                    <h1>Senecio crassiflorus f. maritimus</h1>
<p>Senecio crassiflorus f. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its resilience to salt spray and strong winds makes it an ideal plant for coastal restoration projects.</p>
