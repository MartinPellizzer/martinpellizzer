<p>Sapium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to round leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red蒴果 that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
