<p>Scherya, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Scherya species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a unique coloration and structure. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific environmental conditions in their native habitats.</p>
