                            <h1>Salsola Decumbens</h1>
<p>Russian thistle, scientifically known as Salsola decumbens, is a hardy plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in disturbed soils and open landscapes. Despite its common name, it is not native to Russia but has spread widely across North America. The plant is often mistaken for a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Its resilience and adaptability make it a significant ecological and agricultural concern in many regions.</p>
