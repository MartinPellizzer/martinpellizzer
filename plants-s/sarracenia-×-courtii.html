                    <h1>Sarracenia × courtii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × courtii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The plant produces striking red or orange-colored pitchers that are both visually appealing and functional for trapping prey. These pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-rich liquid to break down insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various wetland environments makes it a popular choice for both botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
