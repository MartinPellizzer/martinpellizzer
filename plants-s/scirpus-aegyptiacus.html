<p>Scirpus aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Africa, Asia, and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered spikes, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus aegyptiacus is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some regions.</p>
