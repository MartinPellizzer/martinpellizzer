                    <h1>Satyrium epipogium</h1>
<p>Satyrium epipogium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but are instead specialized vegetative organs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
