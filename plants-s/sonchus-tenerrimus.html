<p>Sonchus tenerrimus, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Sonchus tenerrimus is also an important plant for pollinators, providing nectar and pollen during its flowering period.</p>
