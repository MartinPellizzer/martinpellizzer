                    <h1>Struthiopteris dentata</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris dentata, commonly known as the toothed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into pinnae with a distinctive toothed or serrated margin, which gives the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
