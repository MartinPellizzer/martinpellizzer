                    <h1>Sabulina ponae</h1>
<p>Sabulina ponae, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-gray, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sabulina ponae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
