                    <h1>Salix vinogradovii</h1>
<p>Salix vinogradovii, commonly known as the Russian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense networks, making it adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Salix vinogradovii is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
