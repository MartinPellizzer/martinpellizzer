<p>Stigmaphyllon micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered stigmaphyllon, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many bromeliads. Its leaves are often covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Stigmaphyllon micranthum is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing microhabitats for various organisms.</p>
