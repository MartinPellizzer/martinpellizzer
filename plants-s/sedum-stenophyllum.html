<p>Sedum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
