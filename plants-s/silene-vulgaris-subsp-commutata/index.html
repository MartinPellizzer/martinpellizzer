                            <h1>Silene Vulgaris Subsp. Commutata</h1>
<p>Silene vulgaris subsp. commutata, commonly known as the common campion, is a widespread flowering plant found in various habitats across temperate regions. This species is characterized by its pink or red flowers and distinctive hairy stems, which help it thrive in a range of environmental conditions. It often grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, making it a common sight in open landscapes. The plant is also notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores. Despite its commonality, it remains a subject of interest for botanists due to its adaptability and widespread distribution.</p>
