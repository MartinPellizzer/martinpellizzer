                    <h1>Sporobolus diffusus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus diffusus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense, sprawling mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed soils.</p>
