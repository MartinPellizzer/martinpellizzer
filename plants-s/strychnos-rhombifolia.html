                    <h1>Strychnos rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Strychnos rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamondleaf strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are rhombic in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in some cultures for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Loganiaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution.</p>
