                    <h1>Selaginella agusanensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan spike moss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Selaginella agusanensis plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
