<p>White silky senna, scientifically known as Sophora velutina var. albescens, is a strikingly beautiful legume native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its name derives from the silky, white flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a soft and ethereal appearance. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. While it is not widely cultivated for food, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native regions. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species within the Fabaceae family.</p>
