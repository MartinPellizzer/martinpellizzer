                    <h1>Senecio lujae</h1>
<p>Senecio lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Senecio lujae is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
