                    <h1>Striga orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Striga orobanchoides, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily in the grass family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a significant agricultural pest. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, leading to persistent infestations in affected regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crop yields, Striga orobanchoides is a major concern for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
