<p>Silene sericea var. lasiocalyx, commonly known as silky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
