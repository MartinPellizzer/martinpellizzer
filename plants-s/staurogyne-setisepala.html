                    <h1>Staurogyne setisepala</h1>
<p>Staurogyne setisepala, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed waterweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help it adhere to substrates and reduce water flow resistance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often have a waxy surface to prevent water loss.</p>
<p>Staurogyne setisepala plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
