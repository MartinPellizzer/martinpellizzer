                    <h1>Sicyocarya mauiensis</h1>
<p>Sicyocarya mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments on rocky substrates. The plant has a unique morphology, with a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical treasure.</p>
