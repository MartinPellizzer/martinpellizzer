                    <h1>Salix purshiana</h1>
<p>Salix purshiana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is noted for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves of Salix purshiana have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties, particularly for their anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
