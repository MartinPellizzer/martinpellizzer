                    <h1>Sempervivum macrolepum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum macrolepum, commonly known as the Crested Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, tall, flower stalks that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or red. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sempervivum macrolepum is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which allows it to spread readily in suitable conditions.</p>
