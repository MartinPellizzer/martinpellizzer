<p>Sapium merrillianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
