<p>Salix vagans livida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers that develop into woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has historical medicinal uses.</p>
