                    <h1>Schefflera digitata</h1>
<p>Schefflera digitata, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like shape formed by a single, thick, upright stem topped with a dense cluster of large, palmate leaves. The leaves are typically bright green and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though these are not typically noticeable in cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Schefflera digitata is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
