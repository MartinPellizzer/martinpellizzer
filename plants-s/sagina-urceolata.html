<p>Sagina urceolata, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, succulent appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a cluster of tiny bells. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, gardens, and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Sagina urceolata is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions.</p>
