                    <h1>Salix frangula</h1>
<p>Salix frangula, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and its flowers are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix frangula has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
