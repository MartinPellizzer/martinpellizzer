<p>Schedonorus radicans, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant has rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly across the ground, forming extensive colonies. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green color when mature.</p>
<p>Schedonorus radicans is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to withstand frequent mowing.</p>
