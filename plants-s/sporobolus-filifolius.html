                    <h1>Sporobolus filifolius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus filifolius, commonly known as slender basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in desert and coastal sage scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>
