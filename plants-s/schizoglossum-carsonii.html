                    <h1>Schizoglossum carsonii</h1>
<p>Schizoglossum carsonii, commonly known as Carson's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Mojave Desert in the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in late spring. The plant has small, white, star-shaped flowers that are often hidden among the sand, making it difficult to spot. Schizoglossum carsonii is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
