                    <h1>Salix delphinensis</h1>
<p>Salix delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinus willow, is a rare and specialized shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in alpine ecosystems.</p>
