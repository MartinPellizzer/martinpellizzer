                    <h1>Salix serotina</h1>
<p>Salix serotina, commonly known as the late-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male, while female flowers are found on the same plant. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix serotina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
