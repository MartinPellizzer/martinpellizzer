                    <h1>Spilotantha hydrae</h1>
<p>Spilotantha hydrae, commonly known as the water hydra, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Spilotantha hydrae is often found in rocky outcrops and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
