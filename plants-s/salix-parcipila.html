<p>Salix parcipila, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red-brown female flowers that appear in the spring. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Salix parcipila is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
