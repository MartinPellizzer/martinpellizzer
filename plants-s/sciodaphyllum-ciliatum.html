                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum ciliatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum ciliatum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dark green, leathery leaves that have distinctive ciliate margins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and has become a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Sciodaphyllum ciliatum plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its alpine ecosystem.</p>
