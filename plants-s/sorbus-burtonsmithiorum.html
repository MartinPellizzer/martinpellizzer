                    <h1>Sorbus burtonsmithiorum</h1>
<p>Sorbus burtonsmithiorum, commonly known as the Burton-Smith rowan, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, aggregate fruits that ripen in the autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated margins, while its flowers are white and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus burtonsmithiorum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
