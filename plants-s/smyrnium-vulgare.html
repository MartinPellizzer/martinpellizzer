                    <h1>Smyrnium vulgare</h1>
<p>Smyrnium vulgare, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or yellowish flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight.</p>
