                    <h1>Saccoloma inaequale var. galeottii</h1>
<p>Saccoloma inaequale var. galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are clusters of sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
