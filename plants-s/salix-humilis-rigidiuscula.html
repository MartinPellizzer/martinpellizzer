                    <h1>Salix humilis rigidiuscula</h1>
<p>Salix humilis rigidiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reproductive strategy in cold climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment.</p>
