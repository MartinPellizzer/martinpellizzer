<p>Sempervivum arvernense var. glabrecens, commonly known as the Alps carpet plant, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish or silver hue due to a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
