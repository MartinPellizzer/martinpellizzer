                    <h1>Sambucus pubens f. albicocca</h1>
<p>Sambucus pubens f. albicocca, commonly known as the white-fruited elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant characterized by its pale yellow to white berries.</p>
<p>This form is a naturally occurring mutation of the common elderberry, Sambucus pubens, and is notable for its distinct fruit coloration. The plant is typically deciduous, with compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands.</p>
<p>The white-fruited variant is less commonly cultivated than other elderberry forms but is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>
