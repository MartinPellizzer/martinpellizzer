                    <h1>Stellamaris pergrata</h1>
<p>Stellamaris pergrata, commonly known as the silver starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Stellamaris pergrata is considered an endangered species.</p>
