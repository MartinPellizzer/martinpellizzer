                    <h1>Salmia</h1>
<p>Salmia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Salmia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, often with woody stems and small, scale-like leaves adapted to conserve water. They bloom during the warmer months, producing vibrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, some species of Salmia are cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
