                    <h1>Sarracenia minor var. okefenokeensis</h1>
<p>Sarracenia minor var. okefenokeensis, commonly known as the Okefenokee swamp pitcher plant, is a variant of the smaller sarracenia species native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form deep, tubular pitchers designed to trap and digest insects. The plant produces striking red and green striped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its growth is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic wetland environments, often found in marshes and bogs.</p>
<p>The variant is distinguished by its longer pitchers and more robust structure compared to the typical S. minor.</p>
