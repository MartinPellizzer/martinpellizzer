<p>Saxifraga humilis, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
