                    <h1>Stellaria media var. pallida</h1>
<p>Stellaria media var. pallida, commonly known as white chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and small, white flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along woodland edges. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are star-shaped, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical Stellaria media and is distinguished by its paler coloration.</p>
