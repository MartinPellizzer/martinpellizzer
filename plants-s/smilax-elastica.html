                    <h1>Smilax elastica</h1>
<p>Smilax elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to grip and climb various structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its roots contain a latex-like substance, which has been used traditionally for its elastic properties.</p>
<p>Smilax elastica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
