                    <h1>Saxifraga retusa var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga retusa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, though the variety glabrata is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
