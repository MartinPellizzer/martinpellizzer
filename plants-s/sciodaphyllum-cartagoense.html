                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum cartagoense</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum cartagoense, commonly known as the Cartagena sunshade, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are adapted to capture and retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are pollinated by specific insects. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum cartagoense is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
