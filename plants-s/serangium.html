<p>Serangium, commonly known as the "spearhead orchid," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, sword-shaped leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Serangium species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they often have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species.</p>
