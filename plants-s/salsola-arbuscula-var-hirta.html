<p>Salsola arbuscula var. hirta, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with a dense, cushion-like structure that helps it conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
