                    <h1>Silene pygmaea</h1>
<p>Silene pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a compact rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate pink or white flowers with five petals, blooming in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects.</p>
<p>Silene pygmaea is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
