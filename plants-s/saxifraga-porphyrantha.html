                    <h1>Saxifraga porphyrantha</h1>
<p>Saxifraga porphyrantha, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga porphyrantha is often found growing on rocky slopes and in tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
