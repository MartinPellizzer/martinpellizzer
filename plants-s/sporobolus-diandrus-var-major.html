                    <h1>Sporobolus diandrus var. major</h1>
<p>Sporobolus diandrus var. major, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and tolerating heat and drought.</p>
<p>Its dense growth pattern makes it an excellent choice for low-maintenance lawns and erosion control in dry regions.</p>
