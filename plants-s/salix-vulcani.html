<p>Salix vulcani, commonly known as the volcanic willow, is a rare and unique species of willow native to the volcanic regions of Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soils and is often found near thermal springs or in geothermal areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Salix vulcani is considered a specialized species with ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
