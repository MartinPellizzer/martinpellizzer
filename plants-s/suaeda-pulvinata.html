<p>Suaeda pulvinata, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Suaeda pulvinata is native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
