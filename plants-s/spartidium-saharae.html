                    <h1>Spartidium saharae</h1>
<p>Spartidium saharae, commonly known as the Saharan spartidium, is a rare and resilient plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and adaptive structures for survival in harsh environments. The plant exhibits a low-growing, succulent morphology, allowing it to store water and reduce surface area exposed to extreme temperatures. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Spartidium saharae plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert insects.</p>
