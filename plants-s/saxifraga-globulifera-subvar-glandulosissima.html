                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera subvar. glandulosissima</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera subvar. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
