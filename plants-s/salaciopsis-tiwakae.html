                    <h1>Salaciopsis tiwakae</h1>
<p>Salaciopsis tiwakae, commonly known as the Tiwakae's salacii, is a rare fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salaciacae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for taxonomists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Salaciopsis tiwakae is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
