                    <h1>Strychnos ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Strychnos ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf strychnos, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain toxic alkaloids, which have been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal or ritual purposes.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern horticulture.</p>
