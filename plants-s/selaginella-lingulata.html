                    <h1>Selaginella lingulata</h1>
<p>Selaginella lingulata, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a small, evergreen plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant has a unique ability to survive in dry conditions due to its specialized structures called pseudostems, which store water. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Selaginella lingulata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right environment.</p>
