<p>Spergularia marginata subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy coastal areas. It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from S. marginata, particularly in leaf shape and growth habit.</p>
