                    <h1>Salix scouleriana f. poikila</h1>
<p>Salix scouleriana f. poikila, commonly known as the variable willow, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its variability in form makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
