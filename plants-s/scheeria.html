                    <h1>Scheeria</h1>
<p>Scheeria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Scheeria species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. They are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or tree trunks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and color variations.</p>
