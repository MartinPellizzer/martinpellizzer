<p>Sedum giajae, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in late summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Sedum giajae is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
