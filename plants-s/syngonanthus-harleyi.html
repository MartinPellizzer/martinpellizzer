                    <h1>Syngonanthus harleyi</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus harleyi, commonly known as the Harley's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
