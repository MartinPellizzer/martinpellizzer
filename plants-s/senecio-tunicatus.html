                    <h1>Senecio tunicatus</h1>
<p>Senecio tunicatus, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled spheres.</p>
<p>Senecio tunicatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
