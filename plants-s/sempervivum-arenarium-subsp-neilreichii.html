<p>Sempervivum arenarium subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilreich's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>
