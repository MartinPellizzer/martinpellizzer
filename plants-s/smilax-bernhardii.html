<p>Smilax bernhardii, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust, woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and they are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Smilax bernhardii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks.</p>
