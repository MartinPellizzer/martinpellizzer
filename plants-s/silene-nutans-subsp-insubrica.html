<p>Silene nutans subsp.</p>
<p>insubrica, commonly known as the nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Silene nutans.</p>
