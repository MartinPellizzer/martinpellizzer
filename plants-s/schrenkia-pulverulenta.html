<p>Schrenkia pulverulenta, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a compact, succulent-like growth habit, allowing it to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Schrenkia pulverulenta is adapted to harsh desert environments, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
