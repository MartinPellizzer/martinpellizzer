<p>Sisymbrium arnottianum var. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved winter cress, is a biennial or perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of pinnatisect leaves, which are deeply divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
