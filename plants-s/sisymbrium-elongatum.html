                    <h1>Sisymbrium elongatum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium elongatum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a slender, branched stem that often grows close to the ground. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can cause economic losses in crop production.</p>
