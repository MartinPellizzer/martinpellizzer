<p>Synaedrys kuarunensis, commonly known as the Kuarun mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and melaleuca, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for native birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Synaedrys kuarunensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
