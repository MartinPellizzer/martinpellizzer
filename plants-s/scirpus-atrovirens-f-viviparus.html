<p>Scirpus atrovirens f. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush characterized by its unique viviparous reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its stems are tall and cylindrical, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The plant produces specialized structures called viviparous shoots, which develop on the stems and can root upon contact with water, facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
