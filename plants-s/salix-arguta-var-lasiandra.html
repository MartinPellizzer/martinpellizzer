<p>Salix arguta var. lasiandra, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that becomes flaky with age. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky down that gives the plant its common name. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
