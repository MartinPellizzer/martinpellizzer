<p>Sonchus friesii var. friesii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings.</p>
