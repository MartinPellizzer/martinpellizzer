                    <h1>Staurophragma natolicum</h1>
<p>Staurophragma natolicum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on air moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate, veined petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its rarity, Staurophragma natolicum is considered critically endangered in many regions.</p>
