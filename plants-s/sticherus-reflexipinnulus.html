                    <h1>Sticherus reflexipinnulus</h1>
<p>Sticherus reflexipinnulus, commonly known as the reflexed pinnule liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pinnuleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with a distinct central axis and lateral pinnules that are reflexed or curved backward. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Sticherus reflexipinnulus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
