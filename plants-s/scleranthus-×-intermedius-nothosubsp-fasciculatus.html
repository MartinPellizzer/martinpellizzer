<p>Scleranthus × intermedius nothosubsp.</p>
<p>fasciculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandrocket, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, S. arvensis and S. sylvaticus. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often arranged in dense fascicles, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects a blend of traits from both parent species, making it a notable example of hybridization in the genus Scleranthus.</p>
