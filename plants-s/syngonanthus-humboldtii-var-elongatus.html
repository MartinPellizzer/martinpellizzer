                    <h1>Syngonanthus humboldtii var. elongatus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus humboldtii var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various bird species. The plant's root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on host plants for survival.</p>
