<p>Synthyris pinnatifida var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy synthyris, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage provides a unique adaptation for reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
