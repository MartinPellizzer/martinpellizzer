<p>Schizaea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Microsoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. Schizaea intermedia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
