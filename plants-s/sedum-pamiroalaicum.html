<p>Sedum pamiroalaicum, commonly known as the Pamir stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on slopes or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems.</p>
