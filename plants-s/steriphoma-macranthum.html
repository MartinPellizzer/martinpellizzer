<p>Steriphoma macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily inhabits the branches of certain host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host trees. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it forms dense clusters on its hosts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of parasitic plant ecology and host-parasite relationships.</p>
