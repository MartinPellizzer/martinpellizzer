                    <h1>Scleria pterota var. submelaleuca</h1>
<p>Scleria pterota var. submelaleuca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and the margins of water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia.</p>
