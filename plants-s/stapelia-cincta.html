<p>Stapelia cincta, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that resemble insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting flies. Its leaves are typically small and sparsely arranged, contributing to its compact appearance.</p>
<p>Stapelia cincta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique ornamental qualities.</p>
