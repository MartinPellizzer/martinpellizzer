<p>Stelis barbae, commonly known as the beard orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>Stelis barbae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
