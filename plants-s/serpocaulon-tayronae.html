                    <h1>Serpocaulon tayronae</h1>
<p>Serpocaulon tayronae, commonly known as the Tayrona serpentine, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant is notable for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils, which is a common trait among serpocaulon species. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale green, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Serpocaulon tayronae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
