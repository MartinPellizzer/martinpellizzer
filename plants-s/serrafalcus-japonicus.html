                    <h1>Serrafalcus japonicus</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese serrated fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are released from fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more robust than the sterile ones.</p>
