                    <h1>Salsola kali f. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola kali f. tenuifolia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, annual herb with a compact rosette of narrow, bluish-gray leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often mistaken for weeds due to its invasive growth habit. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, drought-prone regions.</p>
<p>It is native to Eurasia but has been introduced to many parts of the world, including North America.</p>
