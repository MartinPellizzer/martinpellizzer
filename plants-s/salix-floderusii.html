                    <h1>Salix floderusii</h1>
<p>Salix floderusii, commonly known as the Floderus willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
