                    <h1>Stellilabium anacristinae</h1>
<p>Stellilabium anacristinae, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, spurred petals that resemble a star. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy. Its flowers are small but striking, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellilabium anacristinae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
