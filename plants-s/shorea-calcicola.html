                    <h1>Shorea calcicola</h1>
<p>Shorea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone shorea, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. The tree's wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in limestone areas, and is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
