<p>Sphaerocephalus macrochaetus, commonly known as the giant globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive, rounded thallus with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Sphaerocephalus macrochaetus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates.</p>
