                    <h1>Salsola auricula var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola auricula var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf Russian thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and has fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. It is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the Salsola genus, which are known for their resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
