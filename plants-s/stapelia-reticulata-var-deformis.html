<p>Stapelia reticulata var. deformis, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features elongated, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a twisted or contorted appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom at night. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unusual morphology and low maintenance requirements.</p>
