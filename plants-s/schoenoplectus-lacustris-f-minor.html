                    <h1>Schoenoplectus lacustris f. minor</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus lacustris f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact flowering heads.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, lake margins, and wet meadows. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
