<p>Salix × glaucovillosa, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives near water bodies such as rivers and streams. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
