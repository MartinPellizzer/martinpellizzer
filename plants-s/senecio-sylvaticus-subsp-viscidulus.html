<p>Senecio sylvaticus subsp.</p>
<p>viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf texture and hair density.</p>
