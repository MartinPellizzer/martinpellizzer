                    <h1>Spartina pectinata</h1>
<p>Spartina pectinata, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to saline and tidal environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Spartina pectinata plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in brackish and saline conditions makes it an important component of estuarine and wetland ecosystems.</p>
