<p>Saccolabium collettianum, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
