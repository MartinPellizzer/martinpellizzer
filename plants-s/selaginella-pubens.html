<p>Selaginella pubens, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. Selaginella pubens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in diverse conditions makes it an important component of many ecosystems.</p>
