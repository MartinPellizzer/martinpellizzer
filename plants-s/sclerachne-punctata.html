                    <h1>Sclerachne punctata</h1>
<p>Sclerachne punctata, commonly known as the punctate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive punctuated texture on the surface. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. Sclerachne punctata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in its native range.</p>
