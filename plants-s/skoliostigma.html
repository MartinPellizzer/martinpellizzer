                    <h1>Skoliostigma</h1>
<p>Skoliostigma, commonly known as the "spearhead fern," is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Skoliostigma species have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
