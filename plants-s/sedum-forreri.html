<p>Sedum forreri, commonly known as the Forreri's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, Sedum forreri is often cultivated as a low-maintenance perennial in gardens.</p>
