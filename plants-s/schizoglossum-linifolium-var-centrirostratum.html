<p>Schizoglossum linifolium var. centrirostratum, commonly known as the central-beaked rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
