                    <h1>Schizachyrium fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Schizachyrium fasciculatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall, and its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer, which are typically brown or tan in color. It has fibrous roots that help prevent soil erosion and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Little bluestem is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
