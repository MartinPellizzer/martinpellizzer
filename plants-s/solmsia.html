                    <h1>Solmsia</h1>
<p>Solmsia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms once a year.</p>
