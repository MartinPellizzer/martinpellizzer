                    <h1>Saxifraga serpyllifolia var. chrysantha</h1>
<p>Saxifraga serpyllifolia var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
