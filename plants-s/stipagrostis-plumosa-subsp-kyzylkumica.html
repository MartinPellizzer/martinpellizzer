<p>Stipagrostis plumosa subsp.</p>
<p>kyzylkumica, commonly known as the Kyzylkum feathergrass, is a grass species native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky, and feathery appearance, with narrow, elongated leaves that give it a delicate, ornamental look.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to high temperatures, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion in its native range.</p>
