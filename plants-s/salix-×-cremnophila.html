                    <h1>Salix × cremnophila</h1>
<p>Salix × cremnophila, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it is somewhat sensitive to urban conditions.</p>
