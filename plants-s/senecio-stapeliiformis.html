                    <h1>Senecio stapeliiformis</h1>
<p>Senecio stapeliiformis, commonly known as the elephant's foot or stapeliopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that resemble an elephant's foot, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
