                    <h1>Selaginella billitonensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella billitonensis, commonly known as the Billiton spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia, specifically the island of Sumatra, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves and distinct spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is a member of the spikemoss group, which are ancient plants that have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella billitonensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
