<p>Sciaphila longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed shadow plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rock surfaces. The plant features slender, elongated stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila longipes is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and overcollection.</p>
