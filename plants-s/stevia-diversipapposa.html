                    <h1>Stevia diversipapposa</h1>
<p>Stevia diversipapposa, commonly known as the Mexican sweetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Stevia diversipapposa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>While it is not as widely cultivated as other stevia species for its sweet leaves, it holds ecological significance in its native range.</p>
