                    <h1>Steris borealis</h1>
<p>Steris borealis, commonly known as the northern ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique structure with a short, erect stem and a cluster of pale green, delicate fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to grow. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Steris borealis is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a bioindicator of Arctic climate conditions.</p>
