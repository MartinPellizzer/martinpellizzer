                    <h1>Sabulina uniflora</h1>
<p>Sabulina uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sandplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal areas of western North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower atop a slender stem, typically in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Sabulina uniflora plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
