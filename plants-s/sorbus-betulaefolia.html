<p>Sorbus betulaefolia, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are white- or silvery-hairy underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin, papery layers.</p>
