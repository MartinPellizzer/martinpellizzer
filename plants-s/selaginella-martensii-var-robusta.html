<p>Selaginella martensii var. robusta, commonly known as the clubmoss or spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and root-like structures called rhizophores, which help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
