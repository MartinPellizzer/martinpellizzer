<p>Solanum lescrauwaetii, commonly known as the Lescauwaet's nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>Like other nightshades, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested.</p>
