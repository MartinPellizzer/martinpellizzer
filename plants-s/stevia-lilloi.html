<p>Stevia lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Stevia lilloi is closely related to the more well-known Stevia rebaudiana, which is used as a natural sweetener.</p>
<p>Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, making it a potential candidate for use in herbal medicine and as a sweetener alternative.</p>
