<p>Sorbus reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Sorbus reverchonii is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
