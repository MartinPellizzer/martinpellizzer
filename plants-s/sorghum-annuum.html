<p>Sorghum annuum, commonly known as the kafir corn or Sudan grass, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and large, loose panicles of bristly, spike-like flowers. The plant is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds, which are used for food, animal feed, and biofuel, are encased in a hard, fibrous hull.</p>
<p>Sorghum annuum plays an important role in both agricultural and ecological systems in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
