<p>Saxifraga × gloriana, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
