<p>Sempervivum grandiflorum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with red or purple edges, which help it store water and survive in harsh environments. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stalks that bear clusters of star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it easy to cultivate and maintain.</p>
