                    <h1>Senecio linearifolius var. graniticola</h1>
<p>Senecio linearifolius var. graniticola, commonly known as the granitic rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its linear, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
