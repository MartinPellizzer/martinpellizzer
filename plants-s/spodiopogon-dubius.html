<p>Spodiopogon dubius, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Spodiopogon dubius plays an important role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
