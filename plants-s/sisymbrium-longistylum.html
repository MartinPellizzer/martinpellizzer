<p>Sisymbrium longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions of Europe and western Asia. Its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers are characteristic features.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium longistylum is often noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
