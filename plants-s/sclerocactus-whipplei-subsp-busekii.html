<p>Sclerocactus whipplei subsp.</p>
<p>busekii, commonly known as the Busekii hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green body. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions.</p>
