                    <h1>Stereochlaena annua</h1>
<p>Stereochlaena annua, commonly known as the annual marsh fern, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, a method of propagation typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Stereochlaena annua plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
