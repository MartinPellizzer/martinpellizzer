<p>Scaevola restiacea subsp.</p>
<p>restiacea, commonly known as the coastal scaevola, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or along coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
