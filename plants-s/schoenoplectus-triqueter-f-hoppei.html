<p>Schoenoplectus triqueter f. hoppei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in marshy environments and is often found in shallow water or saturated soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
