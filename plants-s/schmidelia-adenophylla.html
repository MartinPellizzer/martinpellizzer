<p>Schmidelia adenophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf schmidelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Schmidelia adenophylla is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping.</p>
