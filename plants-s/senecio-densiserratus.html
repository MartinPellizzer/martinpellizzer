                    <h1>Senecio densiserratus</h1>
<p>Senecio densiserratus, commonly known as the dense-toothed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with densely arranged serrations. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions as a decorative plant.</p>
