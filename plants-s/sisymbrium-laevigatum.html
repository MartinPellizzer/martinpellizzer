<p>Sisymbrium laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions such as Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has small, yellow flowers and produces pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
