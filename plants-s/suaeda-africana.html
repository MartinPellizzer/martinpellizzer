<p>Suaeda africana, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, which are typically inhospitable to most plant species. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Suaeda africana is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
