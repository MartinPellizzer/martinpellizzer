<p>Saxifraga densa, commonly known as the dense saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are generally succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga densa is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>
