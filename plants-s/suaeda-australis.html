The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it is often found in dune and estuarine habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Suaeda australis plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
