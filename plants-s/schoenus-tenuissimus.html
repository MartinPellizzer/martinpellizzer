<p>Schoenus tenuissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass native to parts of Africa, Australia, and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Schoenus tenuissimus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
