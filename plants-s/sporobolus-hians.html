                    <h1>Sporobolus hians</h1>
<p>Sporobolus hians, commonly known as the silverleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sporobolus hians is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
