                    <h1>Syringodea echiiflora</h1>
<p>Syringodea echiiflora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Syringodea echiiflora has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
