                    <h1>Sabulina litorea</h1>
<p>Sabulina litorea, commonly known as the sea saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky habitats, often found along shorelines and cliffs where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>Sabulina litorea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
