<p>Stanhopea convoluta, commonly known as the convolute stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Stanhopea convoluta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique growth habits.</p>
