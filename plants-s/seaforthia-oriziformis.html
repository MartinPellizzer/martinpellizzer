                    <h1>Seaforthia oriziformis</h1>
<p>Seaforthia oriziformis, commonly known as the rice-shaped seaforthia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity. Its unique morphology allows it to adapt to tidal fluctuations and salt spray.</p>
<p>Seaforthia oriziformis plays a minor ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
