                    <h1>Salix vaudensis</h1>
<p>Salix vaudensis, commonly known as the Vaud willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tibet. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The Vaud willow is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
