                    <h1>Sceptridium multifidum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium multifidum, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical regions. The fronds are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance, with multiple divisions that give it a distinctive, lacy look. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums due to its specific humidity and light requirements.</p>
