                            <h1>Salix Ilectica</h1>
<p>Black willow, scientifically known as Salix ilectica, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. This species thrives in moist environments, often found near streams, wetlands, and along the edges of lakes. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Despite its beauty, the black willow is also valued for its ecological benefits, including providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
