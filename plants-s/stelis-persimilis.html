                    <h1>Stelis persimilis</h1>
<p>Stelis persimilis, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Stelis persimilis is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
