                    <h1>Sporobolus tenuis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus tenuis, commonly known as slender sanddrop, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Sporobolus tenuis is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites where it plays a role in preventing erosion.</p>
