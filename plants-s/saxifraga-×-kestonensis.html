<p>Saxifraga × kestonensis, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, broadly ovate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus.</p>
