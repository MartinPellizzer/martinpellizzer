<p>Saxifraga cuscutiformis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that resemble the tendrils of parasitic plants, although it is not parasitic itself. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in rocky, barren habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth conditions, it is considered a rare and fragile species.</p>
