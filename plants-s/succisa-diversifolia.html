<p>Succisa diversifolia, commonly known as the variable bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is often found in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and ditches.
