<p>Senecio larahuinensis, commonly known as the Chilean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces small yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio larahuinensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
