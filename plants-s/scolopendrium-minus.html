                    <h1>Scolopendrium minus</h1>
<p>Scolopendrium minus, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant with a rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. Scolopendrium minus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky soils or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its simple, ancient structure reflects its evolutionary lineage as a primitive vascular plant.</p>
