                    <h1>Saxifraga cortusifolia var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cortusifolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive carpets in its natural habitat.</p>
