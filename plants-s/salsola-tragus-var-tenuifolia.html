                    <h1>Salsola tragus var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola tragus var. tenuifolia, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often mistaken for leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Salsola tragus var. tenuifolia is an important pioneer species in desert ecosystems, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
