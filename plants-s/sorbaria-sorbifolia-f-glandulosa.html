It is native to parts of Asia, particularly regions in China and the Russian Far East. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 2â€“5 meters.</p>
<p>Its leaves are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small white flowers in early spring.</p>
