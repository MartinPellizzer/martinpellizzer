                    <h1>Schmidelia rehmanniana</h1>
<p>Schmidelia rehmanniana, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are unusual in the orchid family. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique coloration and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Schmidelia rehmanniana is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
