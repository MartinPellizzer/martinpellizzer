<p>Skeptrostachys arechavaletanii, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's hesperome, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achene.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
