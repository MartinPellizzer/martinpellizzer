<p>Swietenia obtusifolia, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and dark, durable wood that is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>
