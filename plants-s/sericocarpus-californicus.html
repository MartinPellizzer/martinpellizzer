<p>Sericocarpus californicus, commonly known as the California lousewort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits called sericocarps, which are covered in a fine, silken coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
