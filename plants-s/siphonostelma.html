                    <h1>Siphonostelma</h1>
<p>Siphonostelma, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Siphonostelma species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where they can absorb moisture efficiently. Their reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for producing male and female reproductive cells.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations that allow it to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
