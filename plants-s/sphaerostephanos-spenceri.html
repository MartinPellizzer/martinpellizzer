                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos spenceri</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos spenceri, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers clustered along a long, slender stem. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It blooms during the winter months, typically between June and August, and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
