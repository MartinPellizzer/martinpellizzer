                    <h1>Saxifraga cardiophylla</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a single umbel. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
