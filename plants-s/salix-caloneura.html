                    <h1>Salix caloneura</h1>
<p>Salix caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
