<p>Selaginella pouzolziana f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are often marked with distinct spots or markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in cone-like formations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
