<p>Scolopendrium dubium, commonly known as the lesser tamarack, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Scolopendrium dubium is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
