<p>Sphacele inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Sphacele inflata is often found in temperate regions and is known for its specialized adaptations to aquatic life.</p>
