                    <h1>Stylocoryna fragilis</h1>
<p>Stylocoryna fragilis, commonly known as the fragile stylocoryna, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is notable for its short lifespan and rapid growth cycle, often blooming and dying within a single growing season. Its fragility makes it highly susceptible to environmental stress, and it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
