                    <h1>Salix ahlbergii</h1>
<p>Salix ahlbergii, commonly known as the Ahlberg's willow, is a rare and ancient species of willow native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain the plant's reproductive structures. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is noted for its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and high UV radiation.</p>
