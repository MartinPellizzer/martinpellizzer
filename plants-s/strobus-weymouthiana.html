                    <h1>Strobus weymouthiana</h1>
<p>Strobus weymouthiana, commonly known as the Weymouth's fir, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Strobus weymouthiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
