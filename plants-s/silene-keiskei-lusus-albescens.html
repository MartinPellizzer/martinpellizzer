                    <h1>Silene keiskei lusus albescens</h1>
<p>Silene keiskei lusus albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sandmat, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, succulent leaves adapted to withstand salty winds and sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments and is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical and conservation studies.</p>
