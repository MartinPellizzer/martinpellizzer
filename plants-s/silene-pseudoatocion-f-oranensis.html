                    <h1>Silene pseudoatocion f. oranensis</h1>
<p>Silene pseudoatocion f. oranensis, commonly known as the Oranese sand catchment, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, with specialized structures that help it retain moisture in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
