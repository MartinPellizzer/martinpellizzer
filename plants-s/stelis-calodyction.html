<p>Stelis calodyction, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Stelis calodyction is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
