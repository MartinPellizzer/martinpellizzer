                    <h1>Simaba morettii</h1>
<p>Simaba morettii, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that release small, winged seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Simaba morettii is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
