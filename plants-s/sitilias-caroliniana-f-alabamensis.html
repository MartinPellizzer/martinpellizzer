                    <h1>Sitilias caroliniana f. alabamensis</h1>
<p>Sitilias caroliniana f. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by three-lobed, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in its habitat.</p>
