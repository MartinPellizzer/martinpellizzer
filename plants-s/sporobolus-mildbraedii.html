<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water retention.</p>
