                    <h1>Spartina anglica</h1>
<p>Spartina anglica, commonly known as cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coasts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand saltwater and tidal conditions. This species forms dense mats in intertidal zones, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal sediments and preventing erosion. Spartina anglica is also known for its ability to hybridize with native grasses, sometimes leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
