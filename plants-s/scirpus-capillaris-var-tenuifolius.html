                    <h1>Scirpus capillaris var. tenuifolius</h1>
<p>Scirpus capillaris var. tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance compared to its more robust relatives. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often submerged or partially emergent in shallow water. It thrives in marshes, ponds, and other aquatic habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized wetland plant.</p>
