<p>Stipa parviflora f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a variant of the slender bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, hairy texture on the leaves and stems, which distinguishes it from the typical form.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
