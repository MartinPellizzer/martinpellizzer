<p>Stellilabium lueri, commonly known as the star-lipped orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped lip that gives it its common name, and its flowers are typically a vibrant mix of purple and white. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces delicate, pendulous blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
