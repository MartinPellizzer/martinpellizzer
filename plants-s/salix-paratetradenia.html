<p>Salix paratetradenia, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for ecological restoration projects.</p>
