                    <h1>Stellaria saxatilis var. amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Stellaria saxatilis var. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices and slopes. Its leaves are often clasping, giving it the specific epithet *amplexicaulis*, meaning "embrace-like.".</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor, well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
