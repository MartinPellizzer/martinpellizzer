<p>Setaria arizonica, commonly known as Arizona foxtail, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of bristly seeds that are characteristic of the Setaria genus. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Arizona foxtail is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
