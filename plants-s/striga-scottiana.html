                    <h1>Striga scottiana</h1>
<p>Striga scottiana, commonly known as the Scottish striga, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the British Isles and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the health of its host plants.</p>
