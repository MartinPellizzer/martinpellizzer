<p>Sisymbrium compressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release tiny,椭圆形 seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium compressum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
