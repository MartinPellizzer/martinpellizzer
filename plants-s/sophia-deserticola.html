                    <h1>Sophia deserticola</h1>
<p>Sophia deserticola, commonly known as the desert sophia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low water availability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, Sophia deserticola is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
