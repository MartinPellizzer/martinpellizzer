                    <h1>Spartothamnus</h1>
<p>Spartothamnus, commonly known as the desert sage, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These shrubs are characterized by their gray-green foliage and showy, violet or blue flowers that bloom in the spring. Spartothamnus species are adapted to harsh, dry environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. They often form dense thickets, providing habitat and forage for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant's resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
