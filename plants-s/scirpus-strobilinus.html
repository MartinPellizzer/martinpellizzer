<p>Scirpus strobilinus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are densely packed with tiny, scale-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus strobilinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and prevent erosion.</p>
