                    <h1>Sempervivum arachnoideum var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum arachnoideum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in compact rosettes, with leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
