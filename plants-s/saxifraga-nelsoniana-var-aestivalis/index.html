                            <h1>Saxifraga Nelsoniana Var. Aestivalis</h1>
<p>Nelson's saxifrage, scientifically known as Saxifraga nelsoniana var. aestivalis, is a rare and beautiful flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of western North America. It thrives in harsh environments, often growing on rocky slopes and scree fields where few other plants can survive. Its delicate pink or white flowers bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to the rugged landscape. The plant is named after the botanist who first described it, highlighting its significance in botanical history. Due to its limited range and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
