                    <h1>Smythea</h1>
<p>Smythea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Smythea thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in swamps or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited population, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
