<p>Sporobolus longispicus, commonly known as the longspine sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry stems that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing branches. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus longispicus is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
