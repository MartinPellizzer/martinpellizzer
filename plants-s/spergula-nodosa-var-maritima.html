                    <h1>Spergula nodosa var. maritima</h1>
<p>Spergula nodosa var. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the shores of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by small, three-lobed seeds.</p>
