                    <h1>Senecio sandemanii</h1>
<p>Senecio sandemanii, commonly known as the Sandeman's groundsel, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a tight cluster at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used as a decorative filler in succulent arrangements.</p>
