                    <h1>Sagina apetala var. stricta</h1>
<p>Sagina apetala var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
