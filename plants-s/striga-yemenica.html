                    <h1>Striga yemenica</h1>
<p>Striga yemenica, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is native to Africa and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in warm, dry climates. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, Striga yemenica poses a significant threat to food security in affected regions.</p>
