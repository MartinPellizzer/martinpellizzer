                    <h1>Saltugilia caruifolia</h1>
<p>Saltugilia caruifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss, an adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are dense and provide habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Saltugilia caruifolia is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
