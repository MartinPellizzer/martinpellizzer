<p>Stelis florea, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Stelis florea requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive.</p>
