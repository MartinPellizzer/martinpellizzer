                    <h1>Stalagmites</h1>
<p>Stalagmites, commonly known as upward-growing mineral deposits formed in caves, are primarily composed of calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>They form through the slow deposition of mineral-rich water dripping from the ceiling of a cave. The growth process is influenced by factors such as water chemistry, temperature, and the rate of water flow. Stalagmites can take thousands of years to form and are often found in association with stalactites.</p>
<p>Their unique shapes and formations provide valuable insights into past environmental conditions and geological activity.</p>
