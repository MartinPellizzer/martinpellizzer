                    <h1>Sisymbrium millefolium var. brachycarpum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium millefolium var. brachycarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruit shepherd's purse, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, cruciform flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that contain several seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from other varieties of shepherd's purse. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique seed pod morphology and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
