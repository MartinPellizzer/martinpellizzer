                    <h1>Strombosia dubia</h1>
<p>Strombosia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Strombosia dubia has very specific habitat requirements, often thriving in shaded, humid environments with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
