<p>Sparganium eurycarpum var. greenei, commonly known as the broad-fruited burr rush, is a variant of the burr rush species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spiky, brownish flowers that resemble burrs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps stabilize the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
