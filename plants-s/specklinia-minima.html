<p>Specklinia minima, commonly known as the miniature pigmentation fern, is a small epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Its compact size makes it a popular choice for terrariums and small indoor gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is valued by both hobbyists and botanists alike.</p>
