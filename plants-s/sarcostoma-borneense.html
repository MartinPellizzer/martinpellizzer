                    <h1>Sarcostoma borneense</h1>
<p>Sarcostoma borneense, commonly known as the Bornean sarcostoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in the humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcostoma borneense is considered a conservation concern.</p>
