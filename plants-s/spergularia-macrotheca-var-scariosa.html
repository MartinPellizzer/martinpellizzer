                    <h1>Spergularia macrotheca var. scariosa</h1>
<p>Spergularia macrotheca var. scariosa, commonly known as the scaly sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually covered in a waxy, scaly coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>The varietal name "scariosa" refers to the distinctive scaly appearance of its leaves.</p>
