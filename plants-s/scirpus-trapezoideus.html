<p>Scirpus trapezoideus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant has broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, and it produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. Scirpus trapezoideus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
