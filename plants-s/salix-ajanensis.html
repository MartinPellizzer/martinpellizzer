                    <h1>Salix ajanensis</h1>
<p>Salix ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
