<p>Sporobolus coromandelianus var. senegambiae, commonly known as the African sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
