<p>Spiraea aruncus var. micropetala, commonly known as the dwarf bridal wreath spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features arching, slender stems that produce clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a silvery-white underside. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders or rock gardens.</p>
