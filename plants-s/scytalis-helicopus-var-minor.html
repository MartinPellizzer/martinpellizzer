<p>Scytalis helicopus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
