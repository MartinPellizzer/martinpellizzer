                    <h1>Sabal mexicana</h1>
<p>Sabal mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican palmetto, is a tall, cold-hardy palm native to the southeastern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a solitary, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 10 feet in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in branched clusters, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in warmer climates.</p>
