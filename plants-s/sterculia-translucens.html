                    <h1>Sterculia translucens</h1>
<p>Sterculia translucens, commonly known as the translucent sterculia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that display a unique translucency, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sterculia translucens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
