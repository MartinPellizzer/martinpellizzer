<p>Saxifraga ajanica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually gray-green in color, and it produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Saxifraga ajanica is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
