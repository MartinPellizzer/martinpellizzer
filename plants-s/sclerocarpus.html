                    <h1>Sclerocarpus</h1>
<p>Sclerocarpus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Sclerocarpus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>They are well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
