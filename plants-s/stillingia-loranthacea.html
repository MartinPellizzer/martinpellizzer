                    <h1>Stillingia loranthacea</h1>
<p>Stillingia loranthacea, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Stillingia loranthacea is often found in moist, shaded environments within dense forests.</p>
