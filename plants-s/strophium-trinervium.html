<p>Strophium trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Spermatophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Strophium trinervium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
