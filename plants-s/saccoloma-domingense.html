<p>Saccoloma domingense, commonly known as the Dominican fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are relatively short and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Saccoloma domingense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
