                    <h1>Senegalia serra</h1>
<p>Senegalia serra, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its distinctive, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia serra is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
