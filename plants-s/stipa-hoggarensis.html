<p>Stipa hoggarensis, commonly known as Hogg's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open plains and rocky outcrops, exhibiting a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
