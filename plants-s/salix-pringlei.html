                    <h1>Salix pringlei</h1>
<p>Salix pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix pringlei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
