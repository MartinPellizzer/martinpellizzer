<p>Sherbournia zenkeri, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal rock orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in rocky or sandy habitats. It is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
