                    <h1>Senegalia clandestina</h1>
<p>Senegalia clandestina, commonly known as the desert shrub or ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by hard, woody pods containing seeds. Senegalia clandestina is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and provides habitat for various desert animals.</p>
