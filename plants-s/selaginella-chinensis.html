<p>Selaginella chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves and a short, upright stem. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is characterized by the presence of strobila, which produce spores.</p>
<p>Selaginella chinensis is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some Asian countries.</p>
