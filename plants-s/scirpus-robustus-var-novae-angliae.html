                    <h1>Scirpus robustus var. novae-angliae</h1>
<p>Scirpus robustus var. novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged soils.</p>
