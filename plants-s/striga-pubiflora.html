                    <h1>Striga pubiflora</h1>
<p>Striga pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific environmental conditions, including soil moisture and the presence of suitable host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
