                    <h1>Stellaria decumbens var. minor</h1>
<p>Stellaria decumbens var. minor, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Its flowering period generally occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
