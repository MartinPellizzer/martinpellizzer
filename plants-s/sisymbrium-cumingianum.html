                    <h1>Sisymbrium cumingianum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, but it does not produce typical flowers or seeds. Instead, it produces small, yellowish structures called pseudoflowers that resemble flowers but are not true reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
