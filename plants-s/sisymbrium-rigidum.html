                    <h1>Sisymbrium rigidum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium rigidum, commonly known as rigid broomrape, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both a weed and a subject of ecological study.</p>
