                    <h1>Stenostephanus crenulatus</h1>
<p>Stenostephanus crenulatus, commonly known as the crested rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the cooler months, which are typically followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Stenostephanus crenulatus is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
