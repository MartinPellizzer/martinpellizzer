                    <h1>Secale arundinaceum</h1>
<p>Secale arundinaceum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
