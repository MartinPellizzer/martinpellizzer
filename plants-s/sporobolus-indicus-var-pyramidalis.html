<p>Sporobolus indicus var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
