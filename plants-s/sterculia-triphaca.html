<p>Sterculia triphaca, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, cream-colored flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
