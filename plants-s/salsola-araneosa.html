                    <h1>Salsola araneosa</h1>
<p>Salsola araneosa, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Salsola araneosa is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a common component of desert and coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
