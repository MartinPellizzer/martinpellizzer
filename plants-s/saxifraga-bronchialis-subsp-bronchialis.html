<p>Saxifraga bronchialis subsp.</p>
<p>bronchialis, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
