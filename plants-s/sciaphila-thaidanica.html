                    <h1>Sciaphila thaidanica</h1>
<p>Sciaphila thaidanica, commonly known as the Thai shade orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the humid lowland forests of Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its botanical characteristics include a sympodial growth habit and a network of aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sciaphila thaidanica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
