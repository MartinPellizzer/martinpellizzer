<p>Solanum tiinae, commonly known as the Tiina's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep blue color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and limited study, Solanum tiinae remains a relatively obscure member of the Solanaceae family.</p>
