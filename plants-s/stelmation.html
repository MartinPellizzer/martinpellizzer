                    <h1>Stelmation</h1>
<p>Stelmation, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, which are often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Stelmation thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, Oxalis, reflects its association with the wood sorrel family, which includes many species with similar characteristics.</p>
