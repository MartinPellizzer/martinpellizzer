                    <h1>Sempervivum retusum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum retusum, commonly known as the Rosy Alp or Rosy Stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Sempervivum retusum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
