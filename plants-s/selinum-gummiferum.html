<p>Selinum gummiferum, commonly known as the gum arabic plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Africa, particularly Somalia and Eritrea. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its most notable feature is the production of a sticky, resinous substance called gum arabic, which is harvested from the bark.</p>
<p>This resin has been used for centuries in food, medicine, and industry due to its unique properties.</p>
