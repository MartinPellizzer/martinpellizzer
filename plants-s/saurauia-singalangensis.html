                    <h1>Saurauia singalangensis</h1>
<p>Saurauia singalangensis, commonly known as the Singalang sandstone plant, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the limestone and sandstone habitats of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and a distinctive dark green color. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-white clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Saurauia singalangensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
