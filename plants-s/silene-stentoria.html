                    <h1>Silene stentoria</h1>
<p>Silene stentoria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its unique ability to trap and digest small aquatic animals. The plant has specialized bladder-like structures that snap shut to capture prey, aiding in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Silene stentoria plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations.</p>
