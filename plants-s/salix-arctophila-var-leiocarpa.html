                    <h1>Salix arctophila var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix arctophila var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and white on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in wetlands. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to that found in willow trees.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in riparian habitats.</p>
