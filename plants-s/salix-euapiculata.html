                    <h1>Salix euapiculata</h1>
<p>Salix euapiculata, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing form, with slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Salix euapiculata is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those in tundra or alpine habitats.</p>
