<p>Sulcorebutia krahnii, commonly known as the Krahnii Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is a compact, globular cactus with a dense arrangement of cylindrical, ribbed stems that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing stems.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia krahnii is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
