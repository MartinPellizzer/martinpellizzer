<p>Sticherus longipinnatus var. nigropaleaceus, commonly known as the black-pale leaf sticherus, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a creeping rhizome with dark, leathery leaves that have a unique, pale-green to blackish hue on the underside. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with long, slender pinnae that are often clustered closely together. The species is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
