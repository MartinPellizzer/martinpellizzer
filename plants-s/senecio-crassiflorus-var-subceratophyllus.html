<p>Senecio crassiflorus var. subceratophyllus, commonly known as the Cape Flats senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
