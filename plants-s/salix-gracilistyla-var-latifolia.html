                    <h1>Salix gracilistyla var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Salix gracilistyla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the slender willow species native to parts of China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use.</p>
