<p>Stenotus acaulis var. glabratus is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is known for its unique appearance, featuring dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and compact growth habit. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
