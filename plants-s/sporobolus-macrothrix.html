                    <h1>Sporobolus macrothrix</h1>
<p>Sporobolus macrothrix, commonly known as the broadleaf sandbur, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spiny seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a feature that aids in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus macrothrix is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
