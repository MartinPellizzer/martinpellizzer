                    <h1>Stigmatopteris sancti-gabrieli</h1>
<p>Stigmatopteris sancti-gabrieli, commonly known as the Saint-Gabriel holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive stigmate-like structure on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture.</p>
