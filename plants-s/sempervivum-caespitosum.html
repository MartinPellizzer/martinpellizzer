                    <h1>Sempervivum caespitosum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum caespitosum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped clusters of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. It is a low-growing perennial that spreads by offsets, forming compact colonies over time.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and xeriscaping.</p>
