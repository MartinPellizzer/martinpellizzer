                    <h1>Sieglingia pungens</h1>
<p>Sieglingia pungens, commonly known as the spiked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sieglingia pungens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
