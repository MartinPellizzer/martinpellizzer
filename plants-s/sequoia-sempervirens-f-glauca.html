                    <h1>Sequoia sempervirens f. glauca</h1>
<p>Sequoia sempervirens f. glauca, commonly known as the coastal Douglas fir, is a variant of the coastal redwood that exhibits distinctive blue-gray foliage.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its slower growth rate and unique coloration due to a waxy coating on the leaves. It is typically found in the foggy coastal regions of Northern California and Southern Oregon. The plant's foliage is more dense and compact compared to the typical coastal redwood, giving it a more shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
