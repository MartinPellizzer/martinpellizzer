<p>Senegalia caesia var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control.</p>
<p>The silky mesquite is also utilized in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for wildlife and livestock.</p>
