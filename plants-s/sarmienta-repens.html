<p>Sarmienta repens, commonly known as creeping sarmienta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its prostrate stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Sarmienta repens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
