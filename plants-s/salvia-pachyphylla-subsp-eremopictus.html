<p>Salvia pachyphylla subsp.</p>
<p>eremopictus, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its drought-prone environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens.</p>
