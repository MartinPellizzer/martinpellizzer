<p>Saxifraga × pauliniae, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
