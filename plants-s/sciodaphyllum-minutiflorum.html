                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf sun-leaf, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, low-light habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum minutiflorum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
