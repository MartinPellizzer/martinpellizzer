<p>Stigmatopteris carrii, commonly known as the Carri's bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, rounded clusters on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a dark green color with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The sporangia are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps to retain moisture and protect the spores until they are ready to be dispersed.</p>
