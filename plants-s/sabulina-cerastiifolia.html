                    <h1>Sabulina cerastiifolia</h1>
<p>Sabulina cerastiifolia, commonly known as the sand snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the eastern and central regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Sabulina cerastiifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to disturbed soils.</p>
