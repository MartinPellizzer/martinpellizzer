<p>Salix fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the deserts and arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in harsh environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance and adaptability to sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The Fendler willow plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
