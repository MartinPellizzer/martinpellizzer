                    <h1>Salsola kali var. rosacea</h1>
<p>Salsola kali var. rosacea, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or erect growth habit, with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into bristly, spiny fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
