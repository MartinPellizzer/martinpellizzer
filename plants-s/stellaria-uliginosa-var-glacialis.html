                    <h1>Stellaria uliginosa var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Stellaria uliginosa var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often clustered at the base. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
