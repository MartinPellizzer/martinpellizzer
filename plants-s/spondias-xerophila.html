                    <h1>Spondias xerophila</h1>
<p>Spondias xerophila, commonly known as the red sand apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round, red or yellow fruits with a gritty texture. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Spondias xerophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
