<p>Sorbus arranensis subsp.</p>
<p>subpinnata, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a subspecies of the whitebeam tree native to the Scottish island of Arran. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely toothed, sub-pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
