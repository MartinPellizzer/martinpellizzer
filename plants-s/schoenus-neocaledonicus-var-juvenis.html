                    <h1>Schoenus neocaledonicus var. juvenis</h1>
<p>Schoenus neocaledonicus var. juvenis, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
