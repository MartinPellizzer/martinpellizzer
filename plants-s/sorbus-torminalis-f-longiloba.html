<p>Sorbus torminalis f. longiloba, commonly known as the long-leaf whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, giving it a unique appearance compared to the standard species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. It produces small, white to pale yellow berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected plant in some regions.</p>
