<p>Saxifraga brachypus, commonly known as the short-stem saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga brachypus is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
