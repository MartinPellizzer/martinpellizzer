                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. auriculatum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which give it a unique appearance. This cultivar is primarily grown for ornamental purposes rather than as a food crop. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same basic growth habits as other potato varieties.</p>
<p>Its tubers, while edible, are typically smaller and less productive compared to standard potato cultivars.</p>
