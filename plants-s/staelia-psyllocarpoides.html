                    <h1>Staelia psyllocarpoides</h1>
<p>Staelia psyllocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bladderwort family (Lentibulariaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Staelia psyllocarpoides is an example of a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
