<p>Storckiella, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants are typically small herbs with succulent leaves and showy, often white or pink flowers. Storckiella species are adapted to harsh environments, featuring thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soils in their native habitats and are of interest in botanical research for their resilience.</p>
