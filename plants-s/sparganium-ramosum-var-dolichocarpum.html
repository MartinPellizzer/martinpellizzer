                    <h1>Sparganium ramosum var. dolichocarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium ramosum var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce elongated, spiky fruits. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense stands that provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The long, cylindrical fruits are adapted for dispersal by water, contributing to its spread in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
