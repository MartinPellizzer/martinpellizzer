                    <h1>Sceptridium ternatum var. underwoodianum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium ternatum var. underwoodianum, commonly known as the Underwood's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features upright, wiry stems with closely spaced, needle-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, this variant is considered vulnerable and of conservation concern.</p>
