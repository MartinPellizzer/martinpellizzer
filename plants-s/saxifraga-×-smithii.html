                    <h1>Saxifraga × smithii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × smithii, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually ovate to rhombic in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga × smithii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
