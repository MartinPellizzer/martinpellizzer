                    <h1>Sedum ponticum</h1>
<p>Sedum ponticum, commonly known as the European stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum ponticum typically grows in open, sunny habitats like meadows, cliffs, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
