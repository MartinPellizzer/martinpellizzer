                    <h1>Styloglossum microglossum</h1>
<p>Styloglossum microglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a unique lichen species that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically thin and leaf-like in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, enabling it to thrive in various habitats. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
