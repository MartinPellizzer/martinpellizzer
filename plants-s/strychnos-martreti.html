                    <h1>Strychnos martreti</h1>
<p>Strychnos martreti, commonly known as the African poison bean, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, alkaloids that can be lethal in high doses. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical composition and potential medicinal uses.</p>
