<p>Staurogyne humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's starwort, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often floating at the water's surface, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Staurogyne humbertii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
