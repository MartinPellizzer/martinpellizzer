<p>It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
