                    <h1>Sorocea jureiana</h1>
<p>Sorocea jureiana, commonly known as the Jure Island sorocea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Jure in the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Sorocea jureiana is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation laws.</p>
