                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus ritrodes</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus ritrodes, commonly known as the globular-headed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name, and its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, tubular leaves are adapted to conserve water, and it produces nectar to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sphaerocephalus ritrodes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
