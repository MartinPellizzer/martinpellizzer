                    <h1>Sporobolus ledermannii</h1>
<p>Sporobolus ledermannii, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous bristle-like florets, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
