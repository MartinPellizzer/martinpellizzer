<p>Sorindeia befalensis, commonly known as the silverleaf starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Befal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white petals and silvery-green foliage that shimmer in the dappled light. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing along stream banks and in shaded forest clearings. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Sorindeia befalensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
