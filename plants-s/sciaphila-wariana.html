<p>Sciaphila wariana, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and a unique, moon-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sciaphila wariana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
