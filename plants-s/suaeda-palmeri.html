                    <h1>Suaeda palmeri</h1>
<p>Suaeda palmeri, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte shrub native to the arid coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Suaeda palmeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
