                    <h1>Schizaea elegans</h1>
<p>Schizaea elegans, commonly known as the elegant whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of ferns, though it is more closely related to horsetails. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle with a dominant sporophyte stage and a brief, independent gametophyte phase. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Schizaea elegans is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
