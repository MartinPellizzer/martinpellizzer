                    <h1>Schizoglossum oblongum</h1>
<p>Schizoglossum oblongum, commonly known as the slender false flax, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Schizoglossum oblongum is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds, where it thrives with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain desert animals.</p>
