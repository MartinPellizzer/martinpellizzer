                    <h1>Sorbus glabra</h1>
<p>Sorbus glabra, commonly known as the smooth whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge.</p>
<p>Sorbus glabra is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
