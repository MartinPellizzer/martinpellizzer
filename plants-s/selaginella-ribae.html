<p>Selaginella ribae, commonly known as the Brazilian spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella ribae reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important subject in the study of bryophyte and vascular plant evolution.</p>
