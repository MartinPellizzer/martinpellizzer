<p>Smilax pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Pilcomayo smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and spiny projections, which help it to climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Smilax pilcomayensis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
