<p>Sporobolus faucicola, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spiny, bristle-like seeds that aid in seed dispersal by wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus faucicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
