                            <h1>Sphaerolobium Macranthum Var. Pulchellum</h1>
<p>Blue coral tree, scientifically known as Sphaerolobium macranthum var. pulchellum, is a striking member of the Fabaceae family native to the eastern coast of Australia. This plant is celebrated for its vibrant blue flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a stunning visual display during the warmer months. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the shores of New South Wales and Queensland. The tree's unique appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable addition to native gardens and conservation efforts. Its resilience and beauty have made it a symbol of coastal biodiversity in the region.</p>
