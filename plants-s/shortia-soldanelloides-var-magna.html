                    <h1>Shortia soldanelloides var. magna</h1>
<p>Shortia soldanelloides var. magna, commonly known as the large-flowered shortia, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellowish throat. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Georgia and South Carolina, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 cm, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
