                    <h1>Sarotes semihastata</h1>
<p>Sarotes semihastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Sarotes semihastata is well adapted to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
