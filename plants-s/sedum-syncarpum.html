                    <h1>Sedum syncarpum</h1>
<p>Sedum syncarpum, commonly known as the stonecrop or the liveforever plant, is a member of the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of yellow or white, during the summer months. Native to regions of North America, it is often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
