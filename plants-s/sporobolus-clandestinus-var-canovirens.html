<p>Sporobolus clandestinus var. canovirens, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and glabrous, stiff blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, three-awned lemma-like structures. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed and dry soils.</p>
