<p>Sorbus dubia, commonly known as the rare alpine whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
