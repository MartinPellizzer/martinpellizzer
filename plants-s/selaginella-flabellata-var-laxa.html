                    <h1>Selaginella flabellata var. laxa</h1>
<p>Selaginella flabellata var. laxa, commonly known as the laxa spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
