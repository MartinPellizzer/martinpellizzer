                    <h1>Stenanthera yalensis</h1>
<p>Stenanthera yalensis, commonly known as the Yalensis rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Its growth is closely tied to specific microhabitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenanthera yalensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
