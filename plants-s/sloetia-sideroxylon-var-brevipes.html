                    <h1>Sloetia sideroxylon var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Sloetia sideroxylon var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ironwood, is a rare and hardy plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it forms a low, shrub-like structure. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for local biodiversity.</p>
