<p>Selaginella arenicola subsp.</p>
<p>riddellii, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
