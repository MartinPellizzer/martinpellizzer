<p>Sticherus loheri var. major, commonly known as the giant sticherus, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive branching pattern, with multiple fiddleheads emerging from a central stem. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
