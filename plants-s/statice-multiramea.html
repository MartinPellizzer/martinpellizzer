                    <h1>Statice multiramea</h1>
<p>Statice multiramea, commonly known as desert statice, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Statice multiramea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
