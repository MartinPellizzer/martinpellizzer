<p>Stapelia clavigera, commonly known as the "Carrion Flower," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost corpse-like appearance. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Stapelia clavigera is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
