<p>Struthanthus cassythoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Struthanthus cassythoides plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
