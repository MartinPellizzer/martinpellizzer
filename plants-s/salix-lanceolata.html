                    <h1>Salix lanceolata</h1>
<p>Salix lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5â€“15 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Salix lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
