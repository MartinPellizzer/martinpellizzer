<p>Selaginella elliptica, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, carpet-like structure. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Selaginella elliptica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in adverse conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies.</p>
