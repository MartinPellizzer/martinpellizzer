<p>Stenoloma alutaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
