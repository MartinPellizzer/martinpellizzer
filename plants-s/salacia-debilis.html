                    <h1>Salacia debilis</h1>
<p>Salacia debilis, commonly known as the slender salacia, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other members of the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salacia debilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
