<p>Solanum mandonis var. tardecalvescens, commonly known as the late-flowering nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the Solanum mandonis species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black berries and hairy stems, which are typical of the Solanaceae family. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which open at night, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
