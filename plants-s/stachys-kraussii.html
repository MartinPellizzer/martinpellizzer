<p>Stachys kraussii, commonly known as the Cape betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters along the stem, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Stachys kraussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>
