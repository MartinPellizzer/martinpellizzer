                    <h1>Solanum prunifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum prunifolium, commonly known as the red tomato or the wild tomato, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae).</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits resembling small tomatoes. Solanum prunifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in botanical studies for its genetic relationship to cultivated tomatoes.</p>
<p>Its fruit is edible but often has a tart flavor, making it less commonly consumed compared to domesticated varieties.</p>
