                    <h1>Stellaria aquatica</h1>
<p>Stellaria aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>It has delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which help attract pollinators like bees and flies. The plant's leaves are slender and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float or grow submerged depending on water conditions. Stellaria aquatica is an annual plant, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates good water quality, making it an important indicator species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
