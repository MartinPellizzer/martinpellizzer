                    <h1>Schmidtia lagopoda</h1>
<p>Schmidtia lagopoda, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Schmidtia lagopoda is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
