<p>Stelis picea, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
