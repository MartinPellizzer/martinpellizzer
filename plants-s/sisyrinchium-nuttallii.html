<p>Sisyrinchium nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, although it is often classified in the family Iridaceae due to its showy, iris-like flowers. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of its grass-like stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Sisyrinchium nuttallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
