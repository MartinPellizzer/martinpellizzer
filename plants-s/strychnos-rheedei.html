<p>Strychnos rheedei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody, orange-red fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
