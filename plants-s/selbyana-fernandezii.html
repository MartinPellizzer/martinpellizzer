<p>Selbyana fernandezii, commonly known as the Canary Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selbyana fernandezii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
