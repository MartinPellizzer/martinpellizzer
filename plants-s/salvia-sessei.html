                    <h1>Salvia sessei</h1>
<p>Salvia sessei, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Salvia sessei plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
