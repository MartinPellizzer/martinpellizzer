<p>Scirpus timorensis, commonly known as the Timor bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Timor in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus timorensis is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
