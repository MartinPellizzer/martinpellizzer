<p>Senegalia polyacantha subsp.</p>
<p>polyacantha, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, thorn-covered stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, which are an important food source for wildlife and livestock. It is well-suited for reclamation of degraded lands due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and stabilizing soil in desert environments.</p>
