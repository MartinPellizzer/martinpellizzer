<p>Selaginella subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant with a rosette-like growth habit and produces spores rather than seeds. The plant has distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Selaginella subalpina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other alpine flora.</p>
