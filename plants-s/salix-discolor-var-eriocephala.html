<p>Salix discolor var. eriocephala, commonly known as the wooly willow, is a variant of the gray willow native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) hairs covering the stems and leaves, which provide insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its catkins are distinctive and showy.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
