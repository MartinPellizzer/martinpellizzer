<p>Solidago pallescens, commonly known as the pale goldenrod, is a North American flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish to whitish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue, providing a striking contrast to the pale flowers.</p>
