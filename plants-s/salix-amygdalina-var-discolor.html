                    <h1>Salix amygdalina var. discolor</h1>
<p>Salix amygdalina var. discolor, commonly known as the white-barked weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its bark, which is smooth and white when young, peels to reveal a mottled, grayish-brown surface. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and its root system is typically shallow but can become invasive.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types.</p>
