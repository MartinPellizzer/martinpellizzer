<p>Scutellaria bolanderi subsp.</p>
<p>bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a distinctive, hooded calyx, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
