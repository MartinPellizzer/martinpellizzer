                    <h1>Scleria lithosperma var. lithosperma</h1>
<p>Scleria lithosperma var. lithosperma, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
