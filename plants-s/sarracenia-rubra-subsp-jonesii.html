<p>Sarracenia rubra subsp.</p>
<p>jonesii, commonly known as Jones' red pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red pitchers that are often adorned with prominent green veins.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are tubular, with a narrow opening at the top that serves as an entrance for prey. The inner surface of the pitcher is covered with a waxy coating and downward-pointing hairs that aid in trapping insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid, sunny environment to flourish.</p>
