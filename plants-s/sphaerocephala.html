                    <h1>Sphaerocephala</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed plant, is a unique species characterized by its spherical, fleshy stem that resembles a small globe.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise robust structure. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Sphaerocephala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience in low-water environments.</p>
