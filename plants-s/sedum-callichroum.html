                    <h1>Sedum callichroum</h1>
<p>Sedum callichroum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for desert and Mediterranean climates.</p>
