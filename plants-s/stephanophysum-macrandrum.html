<p>Stephanophysum macrandrum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and a distinctive yellow center, and they bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas.</p>
<p>Stephanophysum macrandrum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shade for various aquatic organisms.</p>
