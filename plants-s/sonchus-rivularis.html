                    <h1>Sonchus rivularis</h1>
<p>Sonchus rivularis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, waxy, light green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
