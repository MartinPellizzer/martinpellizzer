<p>Salvia nubilorum, commonly known as the cloud sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking violet to purple flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>
