                    <h1>Spinifex fragilis</h1>
<p>Spinifex fragilis, commonly known as the fragile spinifex, is a hardy, low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and tough, fibrous stems that help it withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, typically in shades of yellow or green, which are pollinated by wind or insects. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it well adapted to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Spinifex fragilis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
