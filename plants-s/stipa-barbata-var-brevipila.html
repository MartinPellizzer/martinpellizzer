                    <h1>Stipa barbata var. brevipila</h1>
<p>Stipa barbata var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, with the bracts being shorter than those of the typical variety.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions.</p>
