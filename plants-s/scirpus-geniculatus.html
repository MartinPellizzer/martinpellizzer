<p>Scirpus geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, three-ranked spikes of greenish to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus geniculatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
