<p>Scirpus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers, preferring moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Scirpus sachalinensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to aquatic environments.</p>
