<p>Sempervivum columnare, commonly known as the hen-and-chicks plant or stonecrop, is a succulent species native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Sempervivum columnare is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which form around the base of the mother plant.</p>
