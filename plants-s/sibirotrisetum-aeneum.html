                    <h1>Sibirotrisetum aeneum</h1>
<p>Sibirotrisetum aeneum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which results from its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological resilience.</p>
