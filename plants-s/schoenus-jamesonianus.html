<p>Schoenus jamesonianus, commonly known as the Jameson's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
