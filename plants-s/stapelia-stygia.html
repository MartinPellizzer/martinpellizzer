<p>Stapelia stygia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as flies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specialized habitat requirements, Stapelia stygia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
