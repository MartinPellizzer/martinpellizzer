<p>Sparganium stoloniferum subsp.</p>
<p>stoloniferum, commonly known as the common bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread through stolons and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the water's surface or submerged in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
