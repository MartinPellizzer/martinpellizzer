                    <h1>Shorea faguetioides</h1>
<p>Shorea faguetioides, commonly known as the yellow meranti, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, dark-brown bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and develops hard, heavy timber that is highly valued for its durability and workability. It plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
