                    <h1>Sarracenia × formosa</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × formosa, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, tubular pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. Its vibrant red and green coloration, along with its ability to thrive in wet, acidic soils, makes it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × formosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its role in ecological studies of plant-insect interactions.</p>
