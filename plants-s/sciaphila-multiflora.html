<p>Sciaphila multiflora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila multiflora is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
