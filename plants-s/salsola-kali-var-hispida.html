                    <h1>Salsola kali var. hispida</h1>
<p>Salsola kali var. hispida, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or alkaline soils, and is native to Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
