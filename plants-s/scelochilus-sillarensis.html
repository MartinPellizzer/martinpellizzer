                    <h1>Scelochilus sillarensis</h1>
<p>Scelochilus sillarensis, commonly known as the Sillares rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure, with showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense colonies on steep slopes or cliffs. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Scelochilus sillarensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
