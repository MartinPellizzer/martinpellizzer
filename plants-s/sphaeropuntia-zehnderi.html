                    <h1>Sphaeropuntia zehnderi</h1>
<p>Sphaeropuntia zehnderi, commonly known as the Zehnder's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Sphaeropuntia zehnderi plays a vital role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
