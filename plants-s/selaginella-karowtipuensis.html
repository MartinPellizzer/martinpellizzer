<p>Selaginella karowtipuensis, commonly known as the Karowtipuens Spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. This plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, through a process called poikilohydry. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Selaginella karowtipuensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
