<p>Olympic figwort, scientifically known as Scrophularia olympica var. lazica, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. This variant of the figwort genus is distinguished by its striking violet and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this botanical treasure from further endangerment.</p>
