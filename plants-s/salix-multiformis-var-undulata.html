                    <h1>Salix multiformis var. undulata</h1>
<p>Salix multiformis var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive undulating margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
