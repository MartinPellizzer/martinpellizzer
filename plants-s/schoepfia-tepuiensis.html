                    <h1>Schoepfia tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Schoepfia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui spongeplant, is a unique flowering plant native to the tepuis, or tabletop mountains, of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of the Andes, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats or compact shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and rarity, Schoepfia tepuiensis is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
