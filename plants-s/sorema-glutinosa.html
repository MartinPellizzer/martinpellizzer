                    <h1>Sorema glutinosa</h1>
<p>Sorema glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky sorema, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>The resinous properties of Sorema glutinosa have made it valuable in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
