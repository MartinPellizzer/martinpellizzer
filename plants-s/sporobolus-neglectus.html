<p>Sporobolus neglectus, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which becomes more silver-gray with age. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowering stems, though they are actually seed-bearing structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus neglectus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland ecosystems.</p>
