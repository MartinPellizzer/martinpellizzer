                    <h1>Setaria viridis var. maritima</h1>
<p>Setaria viridis var. maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. This plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny grains of seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its tolerance of harsh conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion along shorelines.</p>
