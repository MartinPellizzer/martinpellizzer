                    <h1>Seaforthia costata</h1>
<p>Seaforthia costata, commonly known as the coastal seaforthia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils near the coast.</p>
<p>Seaforthia costata is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
