                <h1>Salicornia europaea</h1>
<p>Salicornia europaea, commonly known as glasswort, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, jointed stems that are often tinged with red or pink, and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny green flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations and can store water in its fleshy tissues.</p>
<p>Salicornia europaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
