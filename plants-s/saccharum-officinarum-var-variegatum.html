                    <h1>Saccharum officinarum var. variegatum</h1>
<p>Saccharum officinarum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated sugarcane, is a variant of sugarcane characterized by its distinct variegated foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves exhibit a striking pattern of green and white or yellow markings, making it visually appealing. The variegation is due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll distribution.</p>
<p>While primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, it can also be used for sugar production in certain conditions.</p>
