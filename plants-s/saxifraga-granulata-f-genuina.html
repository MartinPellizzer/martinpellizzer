                    <h1>Saxifraga granulata f. genuina</h1>
<p>Saxifraga granulata f. genuina, commonly known as the granulate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
