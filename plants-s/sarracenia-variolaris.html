                    <h1>Sarracenia variolaris</h1>
<p>Sarracenia variolaris, commonly known as the red-tipped pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular pitchers that are typically red or orange with a yellow or green throat. The plant's leaves form deep, water-filled traps that lure and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Its pitchers are often adorned with fine hairs and nectar-producing glands to attract prey.</p>
<p>Sarracenia variolaris thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
