<p>Sedum ambiflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
