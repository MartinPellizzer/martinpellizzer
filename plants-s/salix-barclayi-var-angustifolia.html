                    <h1>Salix barclayi var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Salix barclayi var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves and twigs are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
