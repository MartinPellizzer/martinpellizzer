                    <h1>Sherbournia buccularia</h1>
<p>Sherbournia buccularia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves and relies solely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are often covered in a layer of white, spongy tissue. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Sherbournia buccularia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
