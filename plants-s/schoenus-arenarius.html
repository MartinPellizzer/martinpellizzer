                    <h1>Schoenus arenarius</h1>
<p>Schoenus arenarius, commonly known as the sand reed, is a grass-like plant native to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica, giving them a gritty texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Schoenus arenarius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various coastal organisms.</p>
