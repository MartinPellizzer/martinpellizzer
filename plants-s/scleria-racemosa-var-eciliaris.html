                    <h1>Scleria racemosa var. eciliaris</h1>
<p>Scleria racemosa var. eciliaris, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike-like raceme, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively and colonize wetland areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated inflorescence and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
