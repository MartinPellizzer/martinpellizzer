                    <h1>Salix × puberula</h1>
<p>Salix × puberula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, silvery-green underside. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
