<p>Stackhousia aphylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, giving it a ghostly appearance, and its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, Stackhousia aphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
