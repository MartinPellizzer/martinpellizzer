                    <h1>Sesleria uliginosa f. micrantha</h1>
<p>Sesleria uliginosa f. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bog sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial grassland plant native to wet and acidic habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and heathlands. Its foliage is typically dense and low-growing, contributing to the structure of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for invertebrates.</p>
