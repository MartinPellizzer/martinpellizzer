<p>Stipa laevissima, commonly known as the smooth feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually specialized reproductive structures. Stipa laevissima thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
