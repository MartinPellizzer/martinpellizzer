                    <h1>Stelis chiriquensis</h1>
<p>Stelis chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu√≠ stelis, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant orchid flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the cloud forests of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
