<p>Silene djimilensis, commonly known as the Djimilensis campion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene djimilensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
