<p>Saxifraga scardica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the European Alps.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, cushion-like form, adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga scardica is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to high-altitude habitats.</p>
