                    <h1>Stelis callosa</h1>
<p>Stelis callosa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, fleshy stem with a distinctive hairy appearance, which is characteristic of its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip.</p>
<p>Stelis callosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
