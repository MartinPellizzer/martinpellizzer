                    <h1>Stapelia normalis</h1>
<p>Stapelia normalis, commonly known as the common starwort, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a fleshy, branching stem system that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia normalis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
