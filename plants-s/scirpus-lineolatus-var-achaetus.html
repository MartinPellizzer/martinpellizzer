                    <h1>Scirpus lineolatus var. achaetus</h1>
<p>Scirpus lineolatus var. achaetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water gardens.</p>
