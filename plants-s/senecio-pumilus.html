                    <h1>Senecio pumilus</h1>
<p>Senecio pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf ragwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
