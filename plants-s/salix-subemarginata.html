                    <h1>Salix subemarginata</h1>
<p>Salix subemarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
