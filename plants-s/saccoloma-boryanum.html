<p>Saccoloma boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>Saccoloma boryanum is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
