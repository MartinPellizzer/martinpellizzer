                    <h1>Sagina nivalis f. laxa</h1>
<p>Sagina nivalis f. laxa, commonly known as the loose snowgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters near the base of the stems. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
