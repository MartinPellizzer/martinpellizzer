<p>Schizaea elegans var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
