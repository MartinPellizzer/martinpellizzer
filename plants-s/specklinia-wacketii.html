                    <h1>Specklinia wacketii</h1>
<p>Specklinia wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's lithops, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small, yellow or orange, and appear in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Specklinia wacketii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
