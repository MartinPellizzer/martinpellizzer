<p>Stipa poeppigiana, commonly known as the silvergrass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperatures. Its fine, needle-like leaves are covered in a dense layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Stipa poeppigiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
