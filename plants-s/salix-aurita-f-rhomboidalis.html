                    <h1>Salix aurita f. rhomboidalis</h1>
<p>Salix aurita f. rhomboidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate to narrowly elliptic leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long. The leaves are usually glabrous on both surfaces and have a distinctively narrow, rhomboid shape, which gives the plant its specific epithet. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers arranged on separate inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses, making it a common sight in riparian habitats.</p>
