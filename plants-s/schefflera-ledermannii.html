<p>Schefflera ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Schefflera ledermannii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage.</p>
