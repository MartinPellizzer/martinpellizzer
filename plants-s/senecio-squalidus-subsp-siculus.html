<p>Senecio squalidus subsp.</p>
<p>siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian ragged-robin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers.</p>
