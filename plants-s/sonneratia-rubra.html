<p>Sonneratia rubra, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by woody, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Sonneratia rubra is a keystone species in mangrove forests, contributing to biodiversity and shoreline protection.</p>
