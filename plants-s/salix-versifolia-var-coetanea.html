<p>Salix versifolia var. coetanea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or whitish underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
