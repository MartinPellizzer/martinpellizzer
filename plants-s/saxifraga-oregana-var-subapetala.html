<p>Saxifraga oregana var. subapetala, commonly known as the Pacific coast saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced petals, giving it a unique appearance compared to other saxifrage species.</p>
