                    <h1>Sorghum × almum</h1>
<p>Sorghum × almum, commonly known as crossbred sorghum, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and another species, often a related grass.</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, such as improved stress tolerance and enhanced yield potential. The plant typically has tall, robust stalks with narrow leaves, and it produces panicles of small, clustered flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable crop in agricultural systems facing environmental challenges.</p>
