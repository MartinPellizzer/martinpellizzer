                    <h1>Salicornia gracillima</h1>
<p>Salicornia gracillima, commonly known as sea beans or glassweed, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Salicornia gracillima is a valuable source of nutrition for both wildlife and humans, particularly in regions with high salinity.</p>
