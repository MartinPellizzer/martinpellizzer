<p>Schoenus fluitans var. tenellus, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a variant of the floating grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
