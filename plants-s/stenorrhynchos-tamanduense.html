                    <h1>Stenorrhynchos tamanduense</h1>
<p>Stenorrhynchos tamanduense, commonly known as the Tamandua orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, requiring high levels of moisture and indirect sunlight. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
