<p>Solanum dolichopodum, commonly known as the longpod nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrubland and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans.</p>
