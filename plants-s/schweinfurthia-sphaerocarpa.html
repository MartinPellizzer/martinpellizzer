                    <h1>Schweinfurthia sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Schweinfurthia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe thimble cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Schweinfurthia sphaerocarpa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
