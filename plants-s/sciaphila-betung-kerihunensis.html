<p>Sciaphila betung-kerihunensis, commonly known as the Betung-Kerihun shaded orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the lowland rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water, adapting to its low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and often pale in color, with a unique structure typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
