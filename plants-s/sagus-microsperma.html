                    <h1>Sagus microsperma</h1>
<p>Sagus microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded saguaro, is a unique cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that branches into arms as it matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing tiny seeds. It has adapted to arid environments through its ability to store water in its thick stem and its nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
