                    <h1>Stemmodontia affinis</h1>
<p>Stemmodontia affinis, commonly known as the African sandstone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stemmodontia affinis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
