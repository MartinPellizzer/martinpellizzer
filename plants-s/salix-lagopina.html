                    <h1>Salix lagopina</h1>
<p>Salix lagopina, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination.</p>
<p>Salix lagopina is also notable for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range.</p>
