                            <h1>Selenipedium × Schroederae</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × schroederae is a rare and striking hybrid orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. Known for its tall, spindly stems and large, showy greenish-white flowers, it has captivated botanists and plant enthusiasts alike. This unique plant is a cross between Selenipedium and Schomburgkia, making it a fascinating example of natural hybridization. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and highly sought after in conservation efforts. Its beauty and rarity make it a symbol of the delicate balance between nature and human impact.</p>
