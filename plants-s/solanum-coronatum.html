                    <h1>Solanum coronatum</h1>
<p>Solanum coronatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves and small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to invade native plant communities.</p>
