<p>Stenogrammitis hartii, commonly known as the Hart's stenogrammitis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks.
