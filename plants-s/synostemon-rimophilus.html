                    <h1>Synostemon rimophilus</h1>
<p>Synostemon rimophilus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests members of the Ericaceae family, such as blueberries and huckleberries.</p>
<p>It grows as a hemiparasite, deriving some of its nutrients from the host plant while also performing photosynthesis. Its small, evergreen leaves are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant's berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Synostemon rimophilus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
