                    <h1>Salix josiana</h1>
<p>Salix josiana, commonly known as the Jos Plateau willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Nigeria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters and serve as the primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix josiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
