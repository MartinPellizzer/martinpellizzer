<p>Saxifraga mollis, commonly known as the soft saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Saxifraga mollis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
