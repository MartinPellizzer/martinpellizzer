                    <h1>Salix incana var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Salix incana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of other willow species. The leaves are usually grayish-green on the upper surface and whitish beneath, with a distinctive fuzzy texture. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands.</p>
