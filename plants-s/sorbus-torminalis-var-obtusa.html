                    <h1>Sorbus torminalis var. obtusa</h1>
<p>Sorbus torminalis var. obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, often bluish-green leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Sorbus torminalis. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with shallow furrows, and it is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
