                    <h1>Scleroxylum mite</h1>
<p>Scleroxylum mite, commonly known as the black mangrove mite, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found on the leaves of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) in coastal regions. The mite feeds on the plant's sap, causing stippling and discoloration on the foliage. Its life cycle includes several stages, with eggs, larvae, and nymphs all contributing to the damage.</p>
<p>Botanically, the mite's presence is often an indicator of environmental stress or ecological imbalance in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
