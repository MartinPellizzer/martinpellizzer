<p>Setaria brevispica, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Setaria brevispica is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it can form dense mats.</p>
