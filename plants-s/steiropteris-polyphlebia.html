                    <h1>Steiropteris polyphlebia</h1>
<p>Steiropteris polyphlebia, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive, tree-like structure, which can live for many decades.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
