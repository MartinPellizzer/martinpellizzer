                    <h1>Scyphostelma carmenaemiliae</h1>
<p>Scyphostelma carmenaemiliae, commonly known as the Carmen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on the trunks of trees or moss-covered rocks. Its flowers, which bloom only briefly during the wet season, are pollinated by specific species of moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Scyphostelma carmenaemiliae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
