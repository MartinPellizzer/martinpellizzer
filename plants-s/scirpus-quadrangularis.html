<p>Scirpus quadrangularis, commonly known as the square club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular or quadrangular stems, which are often ribbed and have a distinctive angular cross-section. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus quadrangularis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments.</p>
