<p>Sapium plumerioides, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, for wind dispersal.</p>
