                    <h1>Sphaeroclinium</h1>
<p>Sphaeroclinium, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. They are characterized by their spherical or globular growth form, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The leaves are typically small, succulent, and arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sphaeroclinium species produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
