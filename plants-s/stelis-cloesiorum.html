<p>Stelis cloesiorum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive golden hue and intricate lip structure. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis cloesiorum thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
