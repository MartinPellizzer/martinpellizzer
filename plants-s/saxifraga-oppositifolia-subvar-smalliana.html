                    <h1>Saxifraga oppositifolia subvar. smalliana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia subvar. smalliana, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, including rocky soils and tundra, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against cold and desiccation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and characteristic member of Arctic flora.</p>
