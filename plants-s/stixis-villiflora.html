<p>Stixis villiflora, commonly known as the featherleaf stixis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate leaves that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Stixis villiflora is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
