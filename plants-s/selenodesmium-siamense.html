                    <h1>Selenodesmium siamense</h1>
<p>Selenodesmium siamense, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to trees without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Selenodesmium siamense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
