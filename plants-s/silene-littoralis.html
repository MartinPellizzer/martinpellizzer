<p>Silene littoralis, commonly known as the coastal campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a strong adaptation to salt spray and wind. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
