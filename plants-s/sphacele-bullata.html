<p>Sphacele bullata, commonly known as the globular bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Sphacele bullata is a carnivorous plant that relies on its specialized bladders to obtain nutrients from captured prey.</p>
