                    <h1>Sarracenia × tolliana</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × tolliana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in unique morphological traits. The plant produces striking red and green pitchers that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. Its leaves are modified into tubular structures that serve both as traps and as solar collectors.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × tolliana thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires specific care to maintain its health and vigor.</p>
