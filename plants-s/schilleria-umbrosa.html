<p>Schilleria umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds that often appear in shades of green and silver. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, making it well-suited for woodland or shaded garden settings. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats over time.</p>
<p>Schilleria umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
