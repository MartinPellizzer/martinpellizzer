                    <h1>Selaginella vogelii</h1>
<p>Selaginella vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features creeping stems with whorled leaves that are linear and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Selaginella vogelii is an important species in the study of plant survival in harsh climates.</p>
