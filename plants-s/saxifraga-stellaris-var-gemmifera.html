                    <h1>Saxifraga stellaris var. gemmifera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga stellaris var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmed star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to produce vegetative offshoots, or gemmae, which allow it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
