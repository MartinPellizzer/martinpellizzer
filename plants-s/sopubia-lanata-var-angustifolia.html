                    <h1>Sopubia lanata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Sopubia lanata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
