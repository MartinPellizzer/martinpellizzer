<p>Serratula chanetii, commonly known as the alpine serreta, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Serratula chanetii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
