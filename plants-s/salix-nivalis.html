<p>Salix nivalis, commonly known as the snow willow, is a deciduous shrub native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and tundra regions.</p>
