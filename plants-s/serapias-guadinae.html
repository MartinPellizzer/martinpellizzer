                    <h1>Serapias guadinae</h1>
<p>Serapias guadinae, commonly known as the Guadina orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Serapias. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Serapias guadinae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
