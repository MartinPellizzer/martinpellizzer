                    <h1>Salsola iliensis</h1>
<p>Salsola iliensis, commonly known as the Ili saltbush, is a shrub native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions like Kazakhstan and China.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline and arid environments, often growing in desert or semi-desert areas. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water, and its flowers are typically greenish-white, appearing in clusters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals.</p>
<p>Salsola iliensis is an important component of the flora in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity in extreme climates.</p>
