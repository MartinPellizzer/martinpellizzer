<p>Scilla vindobonensis var. montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro scilla, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Montenegro.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and serve as the primary means of vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
