<p>Syringa velutina var. kamibayashii, commonly known as the Japanese lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic and seasonal interest.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical Syringa velutina, making it suitable for smaller spaces.</p>
