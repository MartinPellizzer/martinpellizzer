<p>Sageretia costata, commonly known as the serrated sageretia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in composite heads. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Sageretia costata is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
