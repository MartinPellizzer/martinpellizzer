<p>Stevia, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, green leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Stevia is widely used as a sugar substitute due to its intense sweetness and zero caloric content.</p>
