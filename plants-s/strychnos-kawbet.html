                    <h1>Strychnos kawbet</h1>
<p>Strychnos kawbet, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which make it highly poisonous to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine in some regions, though with great caution.</p>
