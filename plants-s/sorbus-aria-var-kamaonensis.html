                    <h1>Sorbus aria var. kamaonensis</h1>
<p>Sorbus aria var. kamaonensis, commonly known as the Kamaon whitebeam, is a rare variant of the whitebeam species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
