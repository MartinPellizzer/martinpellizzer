<p>Struthiopteris hastata, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly zigzagged appearance along the rachis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
