<p>Salix starkeana subsp.</p>
<p>bebbiana, commonly known as Bebb willow, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often wetland environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local wildlife.</p>
