                    <h1>Squamaria</h1>
<p>Squamaria, commonly known as the squamaria orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a distinctive squamose (scale-like) appearance on the petals and sepals. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Squamaria species are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>They are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their unique beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
