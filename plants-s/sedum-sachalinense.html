<p>Sedum sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Far East, including parts of Russia and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
