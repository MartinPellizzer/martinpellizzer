                    <h1>Salix saidaeana</h1>
<p>Salix saidaeana, commonly known as the Jordanian willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
