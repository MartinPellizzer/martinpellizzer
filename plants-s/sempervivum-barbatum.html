<p>Sempervivum barbatum, commonly known as the Wooly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance.

It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months.</p>
<p>Sempervivum barbatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
