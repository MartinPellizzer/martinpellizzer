                    <h1>Sarothra major</h1>
<p>Sarothra major, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, Sarothra major is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
