<p>Salix eastwoodiae f. callicoma, commonly known as the Eastwood's willow form callicoma, is a rare and unique variant of the willow genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring dense, compact leaves that are often a deep green. This form is typically found in specific ecological niches, such as moist, shaded areas in temperate regions. Its botanical features include slender stems and a growth habit that is more shrub-like compared to typical willow trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
