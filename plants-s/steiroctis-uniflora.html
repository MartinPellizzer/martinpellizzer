<p>Steiroctis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower steiroctis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short stem and produces only one flower per inflorescence, making it unique among its relatives. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Steiroctis uniflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
