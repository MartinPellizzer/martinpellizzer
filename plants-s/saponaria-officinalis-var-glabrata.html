<p>Saponaria officinalis var. glabrata, commonly known as the naked-stem soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called follicles, which contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the saponins present in its tissues, which produce a soapy lather when crushed.</p>
