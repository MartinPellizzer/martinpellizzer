                    <h1>Stelis ancistra</h1>
<p>Stelis ancistra, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Stelis ancistra is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
