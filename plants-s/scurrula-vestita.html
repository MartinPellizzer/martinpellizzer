<p>Scurrula vestita, commonly known as the naked scurrula, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Scoliciosporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered in a thin, powdery layer. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on decaying wood or bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and can serve as an indicator of air quality.</p>
