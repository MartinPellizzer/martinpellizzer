<p>Serpocaulon ptilorhizon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved serpocaulon, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a short, erect flowering stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
