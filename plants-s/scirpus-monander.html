<p>Scirpus monander, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Scirpus monander thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important pioneer species in wetland succession.</p>
