<p>Symplocos sawafutagi var. terrae-nivosae, commonly known as the snow-veil symplocos, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, white pubescence, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
