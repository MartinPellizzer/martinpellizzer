<p>Salix pyramidalis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources.</p>
