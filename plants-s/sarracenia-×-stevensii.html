                    <h1>Sarracenia × stevensii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × stevensii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in a plant with unique characteristics that combine traits from both parents. The plant produces striking, tubular pitchers that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its foliage is typically bright red or orange, with a hairy interior that aids in trapping prey.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × stevensii thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
