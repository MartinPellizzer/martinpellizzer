                    <h1>Scirpus lacustris var. creber</h1>
<p>Scirpus lacustris var. creber, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Scirpus species by its broader leaves and more robust growth habit.</p>
