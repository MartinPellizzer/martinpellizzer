                    <h1>Sphenogyne filipes</h1>
<p>Sphenogyne filipes, commonly known as the slender sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenogyne filipes is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
