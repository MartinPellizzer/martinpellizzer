<p>Smilax hookeri, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and cling to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Smilax hookeri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, and it plays a role in providing food and shelter for various animals.</p>
