                    <h1>Spergularia arvensis var. geniculata</h1>
<p>Spergularia arvensis var. geniculata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a spiral. The flowers are typically pink or reddish, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it common in dune and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its geniculate (jointed) stem structure, which aids in its survival in harsh, windy conditions.</p>
