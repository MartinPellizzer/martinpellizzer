<p>Selaginella springiana, commonly known as the spring star moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microstrobili and megastrobili, which are characteristic of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Selaginella springiana is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
