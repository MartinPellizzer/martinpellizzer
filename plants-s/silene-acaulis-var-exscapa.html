                    <h1>Silene acaulis var. exscapa</h1>
<p>Silene acaulis var. exscapa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of densely packed, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes and cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a characteristic species of alpine flora.</p>
