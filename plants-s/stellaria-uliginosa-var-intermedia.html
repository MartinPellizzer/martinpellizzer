<p>Stellaria uliginosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in wetlands, marshes, and along roadsides. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wet or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment.</p>
