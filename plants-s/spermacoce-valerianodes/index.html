                            <h1>Spermacoce Valerianodes</h1>
<p>Littleleaf spermacoce, scientifically known as Spermacoce valerianodes, is a small, flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. This plant is characterized by its delicate leaves and clusters of small white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>
