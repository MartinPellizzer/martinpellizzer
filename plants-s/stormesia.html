                    <h1>Stormesia</h1>
<p>Stormesia, commonly known as the "storm flower," is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, saline environments, often growing near the edges of mangrove forests. The plant features delicate, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid coastal habitat. Its most distinctive feature is its pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in response to stormy weather.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological adaptations, Stormesia is considered an important indicator species for coastal ecosystem health.</p>
