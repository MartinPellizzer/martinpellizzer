<p>Smilax megalantha, commonly known as the giant yellow smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are generally considered toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat.</p>
