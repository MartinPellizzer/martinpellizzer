<p>Scorzonera halophila, commonly known as the saltwort scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scorzonera halophila is adapted to grow in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity levels.</p>
<p>Its root system is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in unstable, sandy soils.</p>
