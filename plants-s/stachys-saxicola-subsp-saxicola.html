<p>Stachys saxicola subsp.</p>
<p>saxicola, commonly known as the rock betony, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or blue. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
