<p>Saussurea ussuriensis var. laxiodontolepis, commonly known as the Ussuri mountain safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The variant laxiodontolepis is distinguished by its broader, more loosely arranged leaves compared to other forms of Saussurea ussuriensis.</p>
