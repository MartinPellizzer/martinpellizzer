<p>Schoenus quartziticus, commonly known as the quartz grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of silica, giving the plant its name.</p>
<p>Schoenus quartziticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
