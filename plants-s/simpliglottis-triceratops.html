The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist habitats. It belongs to the family Araliaceae, which includes other plants with similar structural and ecological traits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
