                            <h1>Sium Luteum</h1>
<p>Sium luteum, also known as yellow water-plantain, is a unique flowering plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats across northern regions. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and biodiversity. Its presence can indicate the health of wetland areas, making it a valuable indicator plant for environmental studies.</p>
