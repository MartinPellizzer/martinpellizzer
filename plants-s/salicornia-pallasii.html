<p>Salicornia pallasii, commonly known as sea beans or glassweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and brackish wetlands, where it thrives in high-salinity conditions. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Salicornia pallasii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
