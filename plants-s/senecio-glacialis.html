                    <h1>Senecio glacialis</h1>
<p>Senecio glacialis, commonly known as the glacier senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio glacialis produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to the unique biodiversity of its mountainous habitat.</p>
