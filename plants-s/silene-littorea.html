                <h1>Silene littorea</h1>
<p>Silene littorea, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene littorea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
