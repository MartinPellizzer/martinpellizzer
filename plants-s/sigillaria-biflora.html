<p>Sigillaria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sigillaria, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Sigillariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that form a distinctive, shield-like structure around its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are adapted for wind pollination. Sigillaria biflora thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or peaty soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
