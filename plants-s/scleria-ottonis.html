<p>Scleria ottonis, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. Scleria ottonis is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
