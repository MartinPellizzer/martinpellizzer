                    <h1>Stenotaphrum glabrum var. americanum</h1>
<p>Stenotaphrum glabrum var. americanum, commonly known as Florida grass or St. Augustine grass, is a warm-season perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a dense, sod-forming growth habit with broad, dark green leaves that are slightly rolled under the margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is widely used in lawns and turfgrass applications due to its tolerance of heat and humidity.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively and form a thick, durable turf.</p>
