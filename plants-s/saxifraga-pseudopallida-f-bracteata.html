                    <h1>Saxifraga pseudopallida f. bracteata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pseudopallida f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate saxifrage, is a rare and distinctive variant of the saxifrage genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in a terminal inflorescence, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
