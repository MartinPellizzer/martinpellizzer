<p>Stanhopea graveolens, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with seasonal dry periods.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually borne on long, drooping stems and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts.</p>
