                    <h1>Sarcochilus singularis</h1>
<p>Sarcochilus singularis, commonly known as the singular orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus singularis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
