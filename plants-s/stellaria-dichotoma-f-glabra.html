                    <h1>Stellaria dichotoma f. glabra</h1>
<p>Stellaria dichotoma f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems that are often mistaken for being smooth in some varieties, but this form specifically lacks the typical pubescence. Its leaves are typically oval and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
