<p>Schoenorchis manilaliana, commonly known as the Manila orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Schoenorchis manilaliana is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
