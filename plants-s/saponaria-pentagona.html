                    <h1>Saponaria pentagona</h1>
<p>Saponaria pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is soapy to the touch, which is why it is related to the genus Saponaria. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This perennial herb is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in soap-making.</p>
