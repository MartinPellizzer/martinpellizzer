                    <h1>Stipagrostis hirtigluma var. hirtigluma</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis hirtigluma var. hirtigluma, commonly known as the hairy steppe grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as steppe and grasslands, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, a characteristic feature of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to extreme conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
