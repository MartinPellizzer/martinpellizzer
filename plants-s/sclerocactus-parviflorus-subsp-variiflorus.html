<p>Sclerocactus parviflorus subsp.</p>
<p>variiflorus, commonly known as the variable small-flowered cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a dense, spiny exterior that provides protection against herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are typically green and covered in white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
