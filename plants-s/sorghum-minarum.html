                    <h1>Sorghum minarum</h1>
<p>Sorghum minarum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a lesser-known species within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual plant that typically grows to a height of no more than 1 meter, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often green or purplish in color, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Sorghum minarum is native to parts of Africa and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and potential for use in local agriculture.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
