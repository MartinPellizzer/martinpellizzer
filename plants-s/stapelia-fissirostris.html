                    <h1>Stapelia fissirostris</h1>
<p>Stapelia fissirostris, commonly known as the fissured-stem stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that is often ribbed and covered in a waxy, grayish-green coating. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance. These flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, often in clusters at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Stapelia fissirostris is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and requiring minimal care once established.</p>
