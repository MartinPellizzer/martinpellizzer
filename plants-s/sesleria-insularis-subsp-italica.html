<p>Sesleria insularis subsp.</p>
<p>italica, commonly known as the Italian sesleria, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, with a fine texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean-style landscapes.</p>
