<p>Sibirotrisetum bifidum, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in panicles, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Sibirotrisetum bifidum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in cooler climates.</p>
