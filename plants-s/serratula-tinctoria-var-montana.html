<p>Serratula tinctoria var. montana, commonly known as mountain tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
