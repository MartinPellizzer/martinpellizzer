The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
