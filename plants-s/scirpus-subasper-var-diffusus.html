                    <h1>Scirpus subasper var. diffusus</h1>
<p>Scirpus subasper var. diffusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that develop into brown, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus subasper var. diffusus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity.</p>
