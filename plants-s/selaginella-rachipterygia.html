                    <h1>Selaginella rachipterygia</h1>
<p>Selaginella rachipterygia, commonly known as the climbing spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
