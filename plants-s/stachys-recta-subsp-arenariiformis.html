<p>Stachys recta subsp.</p>
<p>arenariiformis, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikes of tiny, violet or blue flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections.</p>
