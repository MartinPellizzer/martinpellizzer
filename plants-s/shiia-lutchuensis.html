<p>Shiia lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchu Island fern, is a rare vascular plant native to the island of Lutchu in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds that exhibit a unique arrangement of pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas within its limited range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Shiia lutchuensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
