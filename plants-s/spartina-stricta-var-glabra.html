                    <h1>Spartina stricta var. glabra</h1>
<p>Spartina stricta var. glabra, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in saline and tidal environments. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion through its extensive root system. It is often found in brackish and saltwater marshes, where it tolerates periodic flooding and high salinity.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
