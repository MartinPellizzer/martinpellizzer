                    <h1>Schoenus subaphyllus var. barbulatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus subaphyllus var. barbulatus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or muddy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy structures compared to the typical form of Schoenus subaphyllus.</p>
