                    <h1>Sterropetalum pillansii</h1>
<p>Sterropetalum pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
