                    <h1>Solanum cataractae</h1>
<p>Solanum cataractae, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic species native to the fast-flowing streams of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, adapting to the strong currents in its habitat. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its roots are specialized to anchor it in flowing water while absorbing nutrients from the stream bed.</p>
<p>Solanum cataractae plays a role in its ecosystem by providing shelter for aquatic invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
