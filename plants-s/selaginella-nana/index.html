                            <h1>Selaginella Nana</h1>
<p>Selaginella nana is a small, compact moss-like plant that belongs to the spore-bearing group known as liverworts. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, including drought and freezing temperatures. Its tiny size and dense growth pattern make it an important component of many ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Selaginella nana plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
