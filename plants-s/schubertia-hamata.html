<p>Schubertia hamata, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Schubertia hamata is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological stability of its environment.</p>
