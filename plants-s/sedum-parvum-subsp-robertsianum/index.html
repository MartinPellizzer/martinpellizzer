                            <h1>Sedum Parvum Subsp. Robertsianum</h1>
<p>Robertson's stonecrop, scientifically known as Sedum parvum subsp. robertsianum, is a rare and fascinating succulent native to the rocky habitats of western North America. This plant is characterized by its compact growth form, fleshy leaves, and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its hardiness, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, efforts are underway to protect and study this delicate species.</p>
