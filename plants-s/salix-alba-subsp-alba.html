<p>Salix alba subsp.</p>
<p>alba, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside.</p>
<p>The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine make it a notable species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
