                    <h1>Sapium carterianum</h1>
<p>Sapium carterianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruits, contributing to its invasive spread in some regions.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy flowers and rapid growth.</p>
