<p>Specklinia medinae, commonly known as the Medina's staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
