<p>Scirpus pallidus, commonly known as the pale bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges.
