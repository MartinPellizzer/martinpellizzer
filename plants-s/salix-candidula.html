                    <h1>Salix candidula</h1>
<p>Salix candidula, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often silver- or white-haired stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix candidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
