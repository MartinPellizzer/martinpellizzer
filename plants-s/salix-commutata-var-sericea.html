<p>Salix commutata var. sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its graceful form and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
