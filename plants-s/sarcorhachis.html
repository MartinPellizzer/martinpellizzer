<p>Sarcorhachis, commonly known as the "giant water fern," is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salvinioideae and is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's structure includes a segmented stem with floating leaves that provide shade and oxygen to the water. Sarcorhachis thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its reproductive system involves the production of tiny, free-floating spores, which contribute to its widespread distribution.</p>
