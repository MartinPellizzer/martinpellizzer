                    <h1>Saccolabium halophilus</h1>
<p>Saccolabium halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Saccolabium halophilus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in salt-affected areas.</p>
