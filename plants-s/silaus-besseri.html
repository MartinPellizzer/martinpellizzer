<p>Silaus besseri, commonly known as the Mongolian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
