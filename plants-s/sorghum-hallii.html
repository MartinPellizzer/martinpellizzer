                    <h1>Sorghum hallii</h1>
<p>Sorghum hallii, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Sorghum hallii is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of biofuel due to its high biomass yield.</p>
