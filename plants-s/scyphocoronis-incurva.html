<p>Scyphocoronis incurva, commonly known as the curled false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Scyphocoronis incurva is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
