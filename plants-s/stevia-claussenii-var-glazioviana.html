                    <h1>Stevia claussenii var. glazioviana</h1>
<p>Stevia claussenii var. glazioviana, commonly known as Glaziov's sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for containing steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its low water requirements and high sweetness, it has potential as a sustainable alternative to traditional sugar sources.</p>
