                    <h1>Sarcocodon</h1>
<p>Sarcocodon, commonly known as the ghost mushroom, is a genus of fungi within the family Sarcococcaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their unique, gelatinous, and often colorful fruiting bodies that resemble small, translucent sacs. They are typically found growing on decaying wood in forested areas, especially in temperate and subtropical regions. Sarcocodon species are saprophytic, meaning they derive nutrients from dead organic matter.</p>
<p>Their distinctive appearance and ecological role make them an interesting subject for mycological study.</p>
