                    <h1>Sorbus subfusca</h1>
<p>Sorbus subfusca, commonly known as the whiteleaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale yellow leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Sorbus subfusca typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in cooler climates.</p>
