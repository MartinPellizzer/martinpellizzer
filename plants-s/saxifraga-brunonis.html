                    <h1>Saxifraga brunonis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga brunonis, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy purple or pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. Saxifraga brunonis is adapted to harsh environments, with its thick leaves and hairy surface helping to reduce water loss and protect against extreme cold.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores.</p>
