                    <h1>Sphaerostigma tortum var. eastwoodiae</h1>
<p>Sphaerostigma tortum var. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's starburst cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical stem with a star-like pattern of raised tubercles, which are covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly prized by cactus enthusiasts for its distinctive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
