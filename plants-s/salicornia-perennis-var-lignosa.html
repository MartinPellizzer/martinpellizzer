                    <h1>Salicornia perennis var. lignosa</h1>
<p>Salicornia perennis var. lignosa, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, jointed stems that often appear glassy or crystalline due to salt deposits. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a natural indicator of salinity.</p>
