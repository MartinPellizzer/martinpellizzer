<p>Stilpnopappus aquaticus, commonly known as the water ragwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in wet environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Stilpnopappus aquaticus is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
