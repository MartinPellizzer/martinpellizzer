                    <h1>Selenodesmium cellulosum</h1>
<p>Selenodesmium cellulosum, commonly known as the cellulose-secreting green alga, is a unicellular freshwater alga belonging to the Chlorophyta division.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to secrete cellulose, which forms a protective sheath around the cell, contributing to its structural integrity. This alga thrives in nutrient-rich aquatic environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its cellular structure includes chloroplasts for photosynthesis and a nucleus enclosed within a cell membrane.</p>
<p>Selenodesmium cellulosum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for microorganisms.</p>
