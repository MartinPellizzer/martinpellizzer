<p>Stelis zelleri, commonly known as the Zeller's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Stelis zelleri is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
