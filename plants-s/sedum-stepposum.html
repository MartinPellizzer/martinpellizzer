<p>Sedum stepposum, commonly known as the steppe sedum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sedum stepposum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
