                    <h1>Sagittaria guyanensis</h1>
<p>Sagittaria guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that emerge from the water, often in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Sagittaria guyanensis is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for aquatic wildlife.</p>
