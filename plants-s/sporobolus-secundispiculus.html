<p>Sporobolus secundispiculus, commonly known as the slender sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss.</p>
