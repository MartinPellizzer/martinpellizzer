                    <h1>Stapelia laevigata</h1>
<p>Stapelia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are small, reduced, and often modified into spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia laevigata is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
