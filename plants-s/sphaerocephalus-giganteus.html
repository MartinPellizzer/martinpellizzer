                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus giganteus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus giganteus, commonly known as the giant spherical moss, is a unique species of moss characterized by its dense, rounded growth form.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant's structure consists of tightly packed, cushion-like clusters of leaves that form a compact, spherical shape. Its leaves are short and broad, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This moss is often found in rocky or sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the substrate and supporting microbial life.</p>
