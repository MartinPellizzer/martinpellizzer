<p>Steffensia flexuosa, commonly known as the slender leaved steppe grass, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the dry, windy conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Steffensia flexuosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
