<p>Sagittaria graminea subsp.</p>
<p>weatherbiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and has strap-like, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, arrowhead-shaped flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.</p>
