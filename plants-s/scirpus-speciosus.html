<p>Scirpus speciosus, commonly known as the showy bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces large, showy spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus speciosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
