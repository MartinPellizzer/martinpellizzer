                    <h1>Saxifraga rivularis var. debilis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga rivularis var. debilis, commonly known as the slender river saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in stream banks and mountainous terrain. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are densely packed along its stem, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps to retain moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
