<p>Silene parnassica subsp.</p>
<p>serbica, commonly known as the Serbian mountain catchfly, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves, which are adaptations to its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
