<p>Staphidiastrum aphananthum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters, often hidden among dense foliage. The plant has a short, creeping stem and produces tiny, scale-like leaves that are adapted to its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
