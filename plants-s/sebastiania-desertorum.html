                    <h1>Sebastiania desertorum</h1>
<p>Sebastiania desertorum, commonly known as the desert sebastiania, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sebastiania desertorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
