                    <h1>Stipa × albasiensis</h1>
<p>Stipa × albasiensis, commonly known as the hybrid fescue, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa phrygana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. It is native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and is often found in areas where its parent species co-occur.</p>
