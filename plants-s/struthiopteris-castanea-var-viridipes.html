<p>Struthiopteris castanea var. viridipes, commonly known as the green bracken fern, is a variant of the bracken fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
