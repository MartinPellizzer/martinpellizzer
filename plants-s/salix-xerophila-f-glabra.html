                    <h1>Salix xerophila f. glabra</h1>
<p>Salix xerophila f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species, and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in desert ecosystems.</p>
