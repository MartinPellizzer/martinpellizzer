<p>Sonchus cuspidatus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows up to 1 meter tall and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions.</p>
