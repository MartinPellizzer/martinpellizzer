                    <h1>Sarcocornia fruticosa var. deflexa</h1>
<p>Sarcocornia fruticosa var. deflexa, commonly known as the dwarf glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in salt marshes and estuaries, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid or brackish conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or reddish and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize coastal soils through its extensive root system.</p>
