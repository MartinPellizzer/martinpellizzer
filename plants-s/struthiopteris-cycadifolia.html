                    <h1>Struthiopteris cycadifolia</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris cycadifolia, commonly known as the cycad-leaf fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble those of cycads.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, acidic soils. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study.</p>
