                    <h1>Stenandriopsis thompsonii var. subdentata</h1>
<p>Stenandriopsis thompsonii var. subdentata, commonly known as Thompson's stenandriopsis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with finely serrated margins, which distinguish it from other varieties within the genus. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
