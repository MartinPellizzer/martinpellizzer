                    <h1>Scyphopappus frutescens</h1>
<p>Scyphopappus frutescens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scyphopappus frutescens is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny environments with minimal water availability.</p>
