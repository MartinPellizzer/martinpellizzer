                    <h1>Solanum praematurum</h1>
<p>Solanum praematurum, commonly known as the early tomato, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries. The berries are typically harvested when they are still immature, as the fruit ripens rapidly and can become seedy if left too long.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its early maturing habit and is often cultivated in home gardens.</p>
