<p>Silene gynodioica subsp.</p>
<p>peduncularis, commonly known as the peduncled sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has a unique reproductive system, as it is gynodioecious, meaning it has both female and hermaphroditic plants within the same population.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and genetic diversity.</p>
