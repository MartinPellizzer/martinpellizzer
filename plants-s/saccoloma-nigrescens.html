<p>Saccoloma nigrescens, commonly known as the black-staining fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its distinctive darkening of the fronds when dried, which gives it its common name.</p>
