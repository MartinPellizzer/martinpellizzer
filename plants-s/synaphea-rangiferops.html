                    <h1>Synaphea rangiferops</h1>
<p>Synaphea rangiferops, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are adapted for pollination by insects active in the short Arctic growing season. Its roots are extensive, allowing it to anchor in nutrient-poor, permafrost soils.</p>
<p>Synaphea rangiferops plays a vital role in providing food and habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
