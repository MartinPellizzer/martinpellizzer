                    <h1>Schoenus stygius</h1>
<p>Schoenus stygius, commonly known as the swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Schoenus stygius plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
