<p>Sandoricum caudatum, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
