                    <h1>Saxifraga secunda</h1>
<p>Saxifraga secunda, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga secunda is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
