                    <h1>Sagina nivalis var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Sagina nivalis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the snow saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This variety is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
