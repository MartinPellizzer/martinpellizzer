<p>Sisymbrium tomentosum var. pauciovulatum, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other flowering plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and attaching to host roots via haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
