                    <h1>Setaria pilifera</h1>
<p>Setaria pilifera, commonly known as hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Setaria pilifera is also used in some traditional medicinal practices.</p>
