                    <h1>Salix wahlenbergii</h1>
<p>Salix wahlenbergii, commonly known as the Wahlenberg's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental plant.</p>
