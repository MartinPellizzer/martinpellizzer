                            <h1>Salvia Angustiarum</h1>
<p>Salvia angustiarum is a lesser-known member of the mint family known for its striking violet-blue flowers and compact growth habit. Native to the rocky slopes of southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to any garden. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively obscure species among gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
