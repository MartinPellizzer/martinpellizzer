<p>Sclerolepis, commonly known as the rock heath or rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. Sclerolepis species are often shrubs or small trees with a compact growth habit, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Their leaves are usually thick and fleshy, which helps them store water and survive in dry climates.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Sclerolepis spinosa, which is native to southern Africa.</p>
