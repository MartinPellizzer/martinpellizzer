                    <h1>Styphelia intricata</h1>
<p>Styphelia intricata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub.</p>
<p>Styphelia intricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds.</p>
