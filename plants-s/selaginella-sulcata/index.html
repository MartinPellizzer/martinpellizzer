                            <h1>Selaginella Sulcata</h1>
<p>Selaginella sulcata, commonly known as the 'sulcate spikemoss,' is a unique and ancient plant that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is often referred to as a "living fossil" due to its evolutionary significance and resemblance to plants from the Carboniferous period. This low-growing, evergreen plant is prized for its ability to thrive in a variety of environments, including rocky soils and shaded areas. Its intricate, needle-like leaves and spore-bearing structures make it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Despite its delicate appearance, Selaginella sulcata is remarkably resilient, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
