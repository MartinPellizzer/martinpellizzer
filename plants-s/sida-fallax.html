<p>Sida fallax, commonly known as the silverleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Sida fallax is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
