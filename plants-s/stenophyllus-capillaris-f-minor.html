                    <h1>Stenophyllus capillaris f. minor</h1>
<p>Stenophyllus capillaris f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leafed capillary fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are usually slender and exhibit a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance, which sets it apart from other fern species. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often of interest to horticulturists and botanists.</p>
