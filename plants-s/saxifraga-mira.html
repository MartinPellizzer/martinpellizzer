<p>Saxifraga mira, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga mira is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in difficult, well-drained soils.</p>
