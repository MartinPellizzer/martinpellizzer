                    <h1>Saussurea pumilio</h1>
<p>Saussurea pumilio, commonly known as the alpine sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, silvery hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saussurea pumilio is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
