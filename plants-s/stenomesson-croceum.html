                    <h1>Stenomesson croceum</h1>
<p>Stenomesson croceum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of acacia trees in arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Stenomesson croceum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, though its parasitic nature can sometimes impact the health of its host trees.</p>
