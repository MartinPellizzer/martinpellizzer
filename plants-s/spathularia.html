                    <h1>Spathularia</h1>
<p>Spathularia, commonly known as the spike moss, is a type of primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Spathularia typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a sporophyte-dominated life cycle, with spores dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants.</p>
