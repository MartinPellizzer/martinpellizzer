                    <h1>Selaginella varians f. sciaphila</h1>
<p>Selaginella varians f. sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving spikemoss, is a fern ally plant characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves arranged in spiral patterns along its stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize and stabilize soil in shaded habitats.</p>
<p>This fern ally is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
