                    <h1>Sorocea muriculata</h1>
<p>Sorocea muriculata, commonly known as the roughleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of palmately lobed, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Sorocea muriculata is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
