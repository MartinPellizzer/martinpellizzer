<p>Schizaea pacificans, commonly known as the Pacific clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves and has a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spore-producing organs. Schizaea pacificans plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, humid forest ecosystems.</p>
