<p>Sempervivum × comollii, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often in spring or early summer. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sempervivum arachnoideum and Sempervivum montanum.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
