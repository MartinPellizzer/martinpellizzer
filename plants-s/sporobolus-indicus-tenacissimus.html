                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus tenacissimus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus tenacissimus, commonly known as the Indian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous root system and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and covered with fine hairs, aiding in water conservation.</p>
<p>Sporobolus indicus tenacissimus is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control in disturbed soils.</p>
