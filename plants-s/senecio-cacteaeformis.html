                    <h1>Senecio cacteaeformis</h1>
<p>Senecio cacteaeformis, commonly known as the "Cactus-like Senecio," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, spiny stems that resemble those of cacti. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise arid appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
