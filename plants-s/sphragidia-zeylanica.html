<p>Sphragidia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, dark blue-black berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
