<p>Scheuchzeria palustris, commonly known as the water sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to the structure of its habitat.</p>
<p>Scheuchzeria palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
