<p>Scleria polyrrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Scleria polyrrhiza is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
