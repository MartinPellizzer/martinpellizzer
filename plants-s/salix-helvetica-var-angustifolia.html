<p>Salix helvetica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense thickets, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
