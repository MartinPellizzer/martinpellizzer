                    <h1>Spergula arvensis</h1>
<p>Spergula arvensis, commonly known as field mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual or biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of 10â€“30 cm and has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny white or pinkish flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Spergula arvensis is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields, where it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
