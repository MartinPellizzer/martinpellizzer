                    <h1>Smilax havanensis subvar. ovata</h1>
<p>Smilax havanensis subvar. ovata, commonly known as the Cuban arrowroot or smooth smilax, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
