<p>Strophostyles, commonly known as water ferns, are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their small, floating leaves that often resemble the shape of a four-leaf clover. These plants typically grow in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Strophostyles species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and their role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including small flowers and fruits, contribute to their ecological significance in wetland habitats.</p>
