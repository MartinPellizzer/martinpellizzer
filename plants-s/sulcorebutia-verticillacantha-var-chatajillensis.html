<p>Sulcorebutia verticillacantha var. chatajillensis, commonly known as the Chatajillensis Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
