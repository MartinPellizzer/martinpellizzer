                    <h1>Sophora carnosa</h1>
<p>Sophora carnosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarack, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flat, leathery seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Sophora carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
