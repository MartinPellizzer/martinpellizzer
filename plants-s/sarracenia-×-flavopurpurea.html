<p>Sarracenia × flavopurpurea, commonly known as the flame pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-and-yellow-colored pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
