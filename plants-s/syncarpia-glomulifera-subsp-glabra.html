<p>Syncarpia glomulifera subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the smooth-spherical acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and is often found in coastal and inland sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a woody, branching stem.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
