<p>Spiranthes tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's ladies' tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and its tall, flowering spike that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions.</p>
