                    <h1>Salix dacica</h1>
<p>Salix dacica, commonly known as the Danubian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in moist, often swampy environments. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale green underside, while the catkins are a distinctive feature of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits.</p>
<p>Salix dacica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
