<p>Sedum leibergii var. typicum, commonly known as the Blue Sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
