<p>Subularia alpina, commonly known as the alpine subularia, is a small, delicate aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats across the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern composed of narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds, lakes, and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late summer, and are adapted for self-pollination.</p>
