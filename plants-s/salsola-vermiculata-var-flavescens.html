<p>Salsola vermiculata var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow gooseweed, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline soils and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with succulent, fleshy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its ability to accumulate salt makes it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
