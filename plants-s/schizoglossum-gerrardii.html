<p>Schizoglossum gerrardii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among members of its family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Schizoglossum gerrardii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
