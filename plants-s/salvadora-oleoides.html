<p>Salvadora oleoides, commonly known as the Indian toothbrush, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of India and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in yellow or greenish-white hues. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its bark contains compounds that have been traditionally used for oral hygiene, and it is also valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Salvadora oleoides plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitats.</p>
