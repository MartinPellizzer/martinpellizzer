<p>Senecio obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf senecio, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are widest near the base and taper toward the tip.</p>
<p>Senecio obovatus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
