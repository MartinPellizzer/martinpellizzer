                    <h1>Salix aquatica</h1>
<p>Salix aquatica, commonly known as the water willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, making it an important species for stabilizing stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix aquatica is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter polluted water.</p>
