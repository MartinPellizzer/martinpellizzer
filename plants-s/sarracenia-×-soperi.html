                    <h1>Sarracenia × soperi</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × soperi, commonly known as the Soper's Pitcher Plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, tubular pitcher leaves that are often brightly colored with red and green hues. The plant produces nectar at the rim of its pitchers to attract insects, which then fall into the digestive fluid below. Its habitat typically includes wet, acidic soils in bog environments, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × soperi is valued by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique carnivorous behavior.</p>
