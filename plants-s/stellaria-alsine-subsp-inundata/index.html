                            <h1>Stellaria Alsine Subsp. Inundata</h1>
<p>Stellaria alsine subsp. inundata is a lesser-known member of the Caryophyllaceae family that thrives in wetland environments. This subspecies is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its small, star-shaped white flowers are a striking feature that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly resilient to fluctuating water levels and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
