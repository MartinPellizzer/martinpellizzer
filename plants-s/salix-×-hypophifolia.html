                    <h1>Salix × hypophifolia</h1>
<p>Salix × hypophifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green on the upper surface and pale white or silver on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
