                    <h1>Stipa paradoxa</h1>
<p>Stipa paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa paradoxa thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
