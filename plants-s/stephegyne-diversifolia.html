                    <h1>Stephegyne diversifolia</h1>
<p>Stephegyne diversifolia, commonly known as the giant rat-tail cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Stephegyne diversifolia is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
