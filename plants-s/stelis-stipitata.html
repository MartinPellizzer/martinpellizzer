                    <h1>Stelis stipitata</h1>
<p>Stelis stipitata, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, stout stem with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Stelis stipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
