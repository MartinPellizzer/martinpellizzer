                    <h1>Stapelia mixta</h1>
<p>Stapelia mixta, commonly known as the Starry Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a dark central spot. These flowers bloom in late summer and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia mixta is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
