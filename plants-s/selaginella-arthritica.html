                    <h1>Selaginella arthritica</h1>
<p>Selaginella arthritica, commonly known as the basket plant or clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella arthritica reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>This ancient plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
