                            <h1>Schnella Coronata</h1>
<p>Coralbean, scientifically known as Schnella coronata, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to southern Africa. Its name comes from the coral-like appearance of its bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in clusters along its stems. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant display. While it thrives in warm climates, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish. Despite its beauty, coralbean is also known for its toxic properties, making it important to handle with care.</p>
