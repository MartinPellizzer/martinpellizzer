                    <h1>Selaginella rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Selaginella rotundifolia, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often rounded in shape. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella rotundifolia reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
