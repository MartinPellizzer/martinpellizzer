<p>Sporobolus eximius, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous spikelets, each containing a single floret. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Sporobolus eximius is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly soils, and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
