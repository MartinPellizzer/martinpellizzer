                    <h1>Setaria villosa</h1>
<p>Setaria villosa, commonly known as hairy foxtail, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a foxtail, with bristly, hair-like bracts. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist to mesic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Setaria villosa is often considered a weed but has ecological value in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
