                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. erythroceras</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. erythroceras, commonly known as the red-capped potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato characterized by its unique red or purple stem tips and foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than culinary use, though it can produce tubers similar to the common potato. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits typical solanum growth habits, including sprawling vines and hairy leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The red pigmentation in its stems and leaves is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are common in many solanaceous species.</p>
