                    <h1>Sarotheca cystolithosa</h1>
<p>Sarotheca cystolithosa, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a lichen species that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate structure, consisting of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, often appearing as a thin, dark-colored layer. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Sarotheca cystolithosa is an important indicator of environmental conditions in semi-arid regions.</p>
