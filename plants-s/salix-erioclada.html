                    <h1>Salix erioclada</h1>
<p>Salix erioclada, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky white hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
