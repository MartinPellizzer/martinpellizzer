                    <h1>Symplocarpus renifolius</h1>
<p>Symplocarpus renifolius, commonly known as the skunk cabbage, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive mottled purple and green spatulate leaves that resemble a skunk's tail. The plant produces a spadix, a fleshy spike of tiny flowers, enclosed within a showy, hood-like bract. It thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and bogs.</p>
<p>Symplocarpus renifolius is notable for its ability to generate heat through thermogenesis, which helps melt through snow and attract pollinators.</p>
