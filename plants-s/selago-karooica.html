                    <h1>Selago karooica</h1>
<p>Selago karooica, commonly known as the Karoo selago, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Selago karooica is well adapted to low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of the Karoo ecosystem.</p>
