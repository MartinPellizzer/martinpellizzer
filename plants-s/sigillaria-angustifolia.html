                    <h1>Sigillaria angustifolia</h1>
<p>Sigillaria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sigillaria, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and segmented structure, which suggests it was a type of ancient fern-like plant. The plant's leaves were likely arranged in a spiral pattern, and its stems showed a complex system of vascular tissue. Sigillaria angustifolia is often found in coal deposits and is used by paleobotanists to study the evolution of early land plants.</p>
<p>Its morphology provides insights into the ecological conditions of the Carboniferous environment.</p>
