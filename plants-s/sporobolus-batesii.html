                    <h1>Sporobolus batesii</h1>
<p>Sporobolus batesii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its reproductive strategy involves wind-dispersed seeds, which are released when the seed heads are disturbed.</p>
<p>Sporobolus batesii plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil structure.</p>
