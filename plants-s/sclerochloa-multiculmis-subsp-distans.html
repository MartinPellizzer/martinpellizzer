<p>Sclerochloa multiculmis subsp.</p>
<p>distans, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
