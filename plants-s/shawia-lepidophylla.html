                    <h1>Shawia lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Shawia lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of liverwort that can survive extreme desiccation.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its ability to revive when exposed to moisture. The plant's leaves are usually tightly curled and turn a reddish-brown color when dry. When water is available, it rapidly unfurls and regains its green, photosynthetic appearance.</p>
<p>This remarkable adaptation allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
