                    <h1>Salix eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Salix eriocarpa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
