                    <h1>Syzygium gonatanthum</h1>
<p>Syzygium gonatanthum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Syzygium gonatanthum is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
