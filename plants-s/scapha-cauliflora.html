                    <h1>Scapha cauliflora</h1>
<p>Scapha cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. The plant produces its flowers and fruits on the main stem rather than the tips of the branches, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Scapha cauliflora is well adapted to saline and coastal conditions, making it a common sight in mangrove swamps and salt marshes.</p>
