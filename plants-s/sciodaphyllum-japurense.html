                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum japurense</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum japurense, commonly known as the Japanese shade fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in dense forests where it receives limited direct sunlight. The plant has finely divided, arching fronds that contribute to its ornamental appeal, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves. It requires well-drained, acidic soil and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum japurense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
