                    <h1>Salix subcinerea</h1>
<p>Salix subcinerea, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
