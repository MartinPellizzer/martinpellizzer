                    <h1>Sarlina</h1>
<p>Sarlina, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which extend above the water to facilitate gas exchange. Sarlina plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
