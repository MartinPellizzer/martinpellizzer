<p>Silene rosulata var. adenocalyx, commonly known as the rose-rooted bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
