<p>Solanum lyciiforme, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, round fruits that resemble tomatillos. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and has adapted to conserve water through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces edible fruits that are used in traditional cuisine.</p>
<p>Solanum lyciiforme is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
