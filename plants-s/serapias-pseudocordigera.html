                    <h1>Serapias pseudocordigera</h1>
<p>Serapias pseudocordigera, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and exhibits unique floral morphology with brightly colored, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, such as bees and flies, and it has a short flowering period in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Serapias pseudocordigera is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
