                    <h1>Stipa chlorostachya var. dumetorum</h1>
<p>Stipa chlorostachya var. dumetorum, commonly known as the yellow grama, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green sheen, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
