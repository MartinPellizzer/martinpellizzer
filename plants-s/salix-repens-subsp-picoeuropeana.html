<p>Salix repens subsp.</p>
<p>picoeuropeana, commonly known as the European creeping willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are elliptical, with a rough, serrated margin, and they are often covered in a fine silvery down.</p>
<p>The flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they bloom in early spring.</p>
