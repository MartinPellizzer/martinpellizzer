<p>Spartina densiflora f. acuta, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in brackish and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. This variety is often found in tidal marshes along the Pacific coast of North America. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
