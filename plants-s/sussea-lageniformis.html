<p>Sussea lageniformis, commonly known as the bottle-shaped sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite and oval, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sussea lageniformis produces showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
