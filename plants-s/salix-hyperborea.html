                    <h1>Salix hyperborea</h1>
<p>Salix hyperborea, commonly known as the polar willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is one of the few willow species that can survive in extremely cold climates. The plant has slender, often hairless branches and small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Salix hyperborea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, polar environments.</p>
