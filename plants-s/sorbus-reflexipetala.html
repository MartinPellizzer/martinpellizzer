<p>Sorbus reflexipetala, commonly known as the reflexed-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, reflexed leaf margins that curl backward, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called pomes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
