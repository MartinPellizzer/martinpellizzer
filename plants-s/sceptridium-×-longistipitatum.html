                    <h1>Sceptridium × longistipitatum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium × longistipitatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a hybrid fern ally characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its morphology reflects adaptations to moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth form and spore production compared to its parent species.</p>
