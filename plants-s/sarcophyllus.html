                    <h1>Sarcophyllus</h1>
<p>Sarcophyllus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sarcophyllus is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
