                    <h1>Seruneum trilobatum</h1>
<p>Seruneum trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that split into three distinct lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bioluminescent at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
