<p>Saponaria officinalis, commonly known as soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Saponaria officinalis is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers and foliage.</p>
