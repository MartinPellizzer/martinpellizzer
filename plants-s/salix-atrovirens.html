                    <h1>Salix atrovirens</h1>
<p>Salix atrovirens, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>The bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
