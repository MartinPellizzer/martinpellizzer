                    <h1>Selaginella barklyi</h1>
<p>Selaginella barklyi, commonly known as the Cape Verde spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to the island of Santiago in the Cape Verde archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a member of the spikemoss family, Lepidophyta, and is characterized by its creeping, stem-like structures that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a specialized adaptation to its arid environment, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Selaginella barklyi is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
