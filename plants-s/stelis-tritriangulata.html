                    <h1>Stelis tritriangulata</h1>
<p>Stelis tritriangulata, commonly known as the Triangular Stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
