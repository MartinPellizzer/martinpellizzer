                    <h1>Sedum emarginatum</h1>
<p>Sedum emarginatum, commonly known as the Margined Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically green with a white or pinkish margin, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Sedum emarginatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to withstand drought.</p>
