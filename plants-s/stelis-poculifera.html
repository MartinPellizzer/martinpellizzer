                    <h1>Stelis poculifera</h1>
<p>Stelis poculifera, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis poculifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
