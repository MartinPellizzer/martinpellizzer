<p>Scrophularia grayanoides, commonly known as the grayanoxylon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Scrophularia grayanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
