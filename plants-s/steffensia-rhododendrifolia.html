                    <h1>Steffensia rhododendrifolia</h1>
<p>Steffensia rhododendrifolia, commonly known as the rhododendron-like steffensia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are leathery and oval, with a glossy surface that helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
