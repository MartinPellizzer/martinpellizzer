                            <h1>Solanum Nigrum Subsp. Luteum</h1>
<p>Yellow nightshade, scientifically known as Solanum nigrum subsp. luteum, is a lesser-known variant of the nightshade family with distinct yellow berries. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. While similar to its more toxic relatives, it is generally considered edible when ripe. Its unique color and flavor make it a subject of both culinary and botanical interest. Despite its beauty, caution is advised due to its potential to be mistaken for more dangerous species.</p>
