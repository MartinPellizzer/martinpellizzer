                    <h1>Saxifraga pensylvanica var. purpuripetala</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pensylvanica var. purpuripetala, commonly known as the purple petal saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its often rocky or sandy habitat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
