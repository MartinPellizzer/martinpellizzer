<p>Scirpus flaccifolius, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>

Its hollow stems and fibrous roots contribute to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus flaccifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket-making.</p>
