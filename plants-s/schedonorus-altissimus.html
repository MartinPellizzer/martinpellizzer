                    <h1>Schedonorus altissimus</h1>
<p>Schedonorus altissimus, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, some varieties can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of endophytic fungi.</p>
