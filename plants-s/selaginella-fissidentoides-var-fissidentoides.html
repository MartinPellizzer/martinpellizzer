                    <h1>Selaginella fissidentoides var. fissidentoides</h1>
<p>Selaginella fissidentoides var. fissidentoides, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky soils or on limestone outcrops. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system with closely spaced, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions.</p>
