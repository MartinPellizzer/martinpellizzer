                    <h1>Setosa erecta</h1>
<p>Setosa erecta, commonly known as the upright spiny plant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny foliage, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Setosa erecta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
