<p>Saxifraga nana, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Saxifraga nana is well adapted to cold climates and is a common indicator species in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
