<p>Salsola pycnophylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Salsola pycnophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
