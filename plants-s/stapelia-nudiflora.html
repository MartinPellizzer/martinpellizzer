<p>Stapelia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy, star-shaped flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature evolved for attracting pollinators like flies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Stapelia nudiflora is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and ease of care.</p>
