                    <h1>Sciaplea</h1>
<p>Sciaplea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and are characterized by their unique, spiny structures that resemble thorns. Sciaplea species typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent leaves and deep root systems.</p>
<p>The plant's name is derived from the Greek word "skia," meaning shadow, referring to the way its leaves shade the ground.</p>
