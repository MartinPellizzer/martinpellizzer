                    <h1>Salix arctica var. graminifolia</h1>
<p>Salix arctica var. graminifolia, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in harsh, cold environments with poor soil. It is well adapted to permafrost conditions and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions.</p>
