<p>Schinopsis balansae var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping copal tree, is a deciduous tree native to the dry forests of northern Mexico and the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, resinous fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its copal resin, which has various applications.</p>
