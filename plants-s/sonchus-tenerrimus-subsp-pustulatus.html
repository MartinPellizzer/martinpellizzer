<p>Sonchus tenerrimus subsp.</p>
<p>pustulatus, commonly known as the woolly beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the tips of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
