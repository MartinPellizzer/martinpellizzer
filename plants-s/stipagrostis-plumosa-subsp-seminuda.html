<p>Stipagrostis plumosa subsp.</p>
<p>seminuda, commonly known as the silky grass or the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silky, and often silver-tinged foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in low, dense clumps, with slender stems that often curl or twist, especially in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient choice for dryland landscaping.</p>
