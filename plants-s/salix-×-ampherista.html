                    <h1>Salix × ampherista</h1>
<p>Salix × ampherista, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis (common osier) and Salix triandra (yellow willow), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and the plant is often found in wetland or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Salix × ampherista is valued for its fast growth and flexibility, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
