                    <h1>Sambucus mexicana var. bipinnata</h1>
<p>Sambucus mexicana var. bipinnata, commonly known as the Mexican elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are twice pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
