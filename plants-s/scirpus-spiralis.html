<p>Scirpus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spirally twisted stems that rise from rhizomes, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scirpus spiralis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
