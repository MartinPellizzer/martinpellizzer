                    <h1>Stipa × gegarkunii</h1>
<p>Stipa × gegarkunii, commonly known as the hybrid goatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa secundiflora.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in the mountainous areas of Kazakhstan and western China.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is primarily propagated through vegetative means.</p>
