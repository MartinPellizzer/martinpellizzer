<p>Stipa spartea var. curtiseta, commonly known as the curly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, finely curled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
