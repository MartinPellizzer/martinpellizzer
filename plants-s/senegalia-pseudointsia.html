                    <h1>Senegalia pseudointsia</h1>
<p>Senegalia pseudointsia, commonly known as the catclaw acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and bipinnate leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by legume pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock.</p>
<p>Senegalia pseudointsia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
