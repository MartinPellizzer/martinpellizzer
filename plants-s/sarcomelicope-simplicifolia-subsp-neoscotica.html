<p>Sarcomelicope simplicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>neoscotica, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on the branches of other trees, such as the ʻōhiʻa lehua, and derives some of its nutrients from its host. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
