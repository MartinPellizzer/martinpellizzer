                    <h1>Scaevola patens</h1>
<p>Scaevola patens, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to thrive in sandy soils and tolerate salt spray makes it well-suited for coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Scaevola patens is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas.</p>
