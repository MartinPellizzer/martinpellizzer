                    <h1>Serratula pungens</h1>
<p>Serratula pungens, commonly known as the prickly sow-thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its hairy, spiny leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though it is considered toxic in high doses.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it both a weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions.</p>
