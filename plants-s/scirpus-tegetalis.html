<p>Scirpus tegetalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or reddish in color, which develop into dry, brown seeds. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus tegetalis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
