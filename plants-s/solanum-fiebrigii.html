                    <h1>Solanum fiebrigii</h1>
<p>Solanum fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrig's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild or semi-wild settings.</p>
