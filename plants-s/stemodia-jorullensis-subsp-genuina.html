<p>Stemodia jorullensis subsp.</p>
<p>genuina, commonly known as the Jorull√©nian stemodia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its habitat is primarily restricted to nutrient-poor soils in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
