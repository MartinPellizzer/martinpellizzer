                    <h1>Sphaeroma glabratum</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma glabratum, commonly known as the smooth sphaeroma, is a species of crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sphaeromatidae and is characterized by its smooth, rounded carapace. This organism is typically found in marine environments, such as tidal zones and rocky shores. It plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to detritus recycling.</p>
<p>Due to its classification as an animal, it is not relevant to botanical studies.</p>
