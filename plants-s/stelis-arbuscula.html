                    <h1>Stelis arbuscula</h1>
<p>Stelis arbuscula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance features delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
