                    <h1>Scirpus ferrugineus var. debilis</h1>
<p>Scirpus ferrugineus var. debilis, commonly known as the slender marsh clubrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is less robust than the typical Scirpus ferrugineus, making it a more delicate and specialized species within the Cyperaceae family.</p>
