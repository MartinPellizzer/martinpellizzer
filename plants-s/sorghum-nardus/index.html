                            <h1>Sorghum Nardus</h1>
<p>Sorghum nardus is a lesser-known grass species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is native to regions of Africa and parts of Asia where it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions. This plant is known for its drought resistance and ability to grow in poor soils, making it an important resource in some agricultural systems. Its use ranges from forage for livestock to traditional medicinal applications in local communities. Despite its resilience, Sorghum nardus remains under-researched and underutilized in modern agriculture.</p>
