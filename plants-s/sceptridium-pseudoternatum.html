<p>Sceptridium pseudoternatum, commonly known as the false fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central stem and leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the phyllidia.</p>
<p>Sceptridium pseudoternatum is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of moist, shaded ecosystems.</p>
