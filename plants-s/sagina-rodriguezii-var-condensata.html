                    <h1>Sagina rodriguezii var. condensata</h1>
<p>Sagina rodriguezii var. condensata, commonly known as the dense saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, succulent leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more condensed foliage compared to other varieties within the Sagina genus.</p>
