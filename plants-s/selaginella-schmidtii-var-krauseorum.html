                    <h1>Selaginella schmidtii var. krauseorum</h1>
<p>Selaginella schmidtii var. krauseorum, commonly known as the Krause's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
