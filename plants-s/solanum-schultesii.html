<p>Solanum schultesii, commonly known as the Schultes's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, opposite leaves, and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and is primarily found in wild habitats.</p>
