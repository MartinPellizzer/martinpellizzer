                    <h1>Sarcocaulon flavescens</h1>
<p>Sarcocaulon flavescens, commonly known as the yellow flax lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive yellowish-green thallus with a velvety texture and is often found on decaying wood or bark. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
