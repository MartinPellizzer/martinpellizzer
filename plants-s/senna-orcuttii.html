                    <h1>Senna orcuttii</h1>
<p>Senna orcuttii, commonly known as the desert senna, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Senna orcuttii is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
