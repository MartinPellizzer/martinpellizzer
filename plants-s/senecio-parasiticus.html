                    <h1>Senecio parasiticus</h1>
<p>Senecio parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially penetrates the roots of its host plants to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
