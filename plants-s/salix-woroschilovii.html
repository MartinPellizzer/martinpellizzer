                    <h1>Salix woroschilovii</h1>
<p>Salix woroschilovii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in colder climates for its ornamental value.</p>
