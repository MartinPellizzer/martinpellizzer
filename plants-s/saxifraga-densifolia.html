<p>Saxifraga densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in June or July. Its leaves are densely arranged, often forming a rosette, and are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga densifolia is often found growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
