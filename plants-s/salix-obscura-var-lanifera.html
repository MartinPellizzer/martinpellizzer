                    <h1>Salix obscura var. lanifera</h1>
<p>Salix obscura var. lanifera, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray pubescent foliage, which provides a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, and its bark is often fissured and peeling. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert washes and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
