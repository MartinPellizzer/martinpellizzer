<p>Salix exigua var. hindsiana, commonly known as Hinds' willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hinds' willow is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in canyons and along streambanks.</p>
