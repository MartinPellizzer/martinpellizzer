                    <h1>Saxifraga radicans</h1>
<p>Saxifraga radicans, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Saxifraga radicans is often found in open, sunny habitats such as tundra, rocky outcrops, and mountain meadows.</p>
