                    <h1>Semiaquilegia simulatrix</h1>
<p>Semiaquilegia simulatrix, commonly known as the mimic mock-violet, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and streambanks. Its name refers to its resemblance to the common mock-violet, though it is not closely related.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health.</p>
