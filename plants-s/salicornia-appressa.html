<p>Salicornia appressa, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water and salt. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures. Salicornia appressa is also known for its edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients and used in various culinary traditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important species for ecological studies and sustainable agriculture.</p>
