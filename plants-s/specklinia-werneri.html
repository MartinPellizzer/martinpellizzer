<p>Specklinia werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's pigmy orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant features compact, dark green leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
