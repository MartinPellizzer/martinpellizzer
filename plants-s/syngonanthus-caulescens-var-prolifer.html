                    <h1>Syngonanthus caulescens var. prolifer</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus caulescens var. prolifer, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense mats, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant features small, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in panicle-like arrangements. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it an important colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
