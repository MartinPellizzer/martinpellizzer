<p>Silene minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous pink or white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Silene minutiflora plays a role in pollination by attracting small insects such as flies and beetles.</p>
