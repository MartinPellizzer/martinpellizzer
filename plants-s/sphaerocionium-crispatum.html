<p>Sphaerocionium crispatum, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Sphaerocionium crispatum is a carnivorous plant, adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting prey.</p>
