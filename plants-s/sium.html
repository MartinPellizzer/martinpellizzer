                    <h1>Sium</h1>
<p>Sium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and edible roots.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbrella-like umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>The roots, which are similar in appearance to parsnips, are sometimes harvested for culinary use, though they are generally more bitter than their cultivated relatives.</p>
