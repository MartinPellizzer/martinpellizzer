<p>Succisa ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, hairy stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Succisa ciliata is adapted to sandy and rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
