                    <h1>Saxifraga tridactylites var. major</h1>
<p>Saxifraga tridactylites var. major, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
