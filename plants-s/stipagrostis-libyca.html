<p>Stipagrostis libyca, commonly known as the Libyan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend or lie flat along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing narrow, awn-tipped lemma and palea. Its leaves are typically narrow and fibrous, adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis libyca plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
