                    <h1>Stemodiacra trifoliata</h1>
<p>Stemodiacra trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its trifoliate leaves, composed of three leaflets, are opposite and often have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Stemodiacra trifoliata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties.</p>
