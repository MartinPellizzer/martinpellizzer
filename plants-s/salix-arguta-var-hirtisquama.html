                    <h1>Salix arguta var. hirtisquama</h1>
<p>Salix arguta var. hirtisquama, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
