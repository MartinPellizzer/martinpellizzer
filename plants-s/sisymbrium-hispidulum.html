                    <h1>Sisymbrium hispidulum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium hispidulum, commonly known as hoary crowsfoot, is an annual flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
<p>The plant's hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
