                    <h1>Saxifraga nivalis var. racemosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nivalis var. racemosa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to withstand cold temperatures and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
