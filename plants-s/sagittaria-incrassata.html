<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Sagittaria incrassata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
