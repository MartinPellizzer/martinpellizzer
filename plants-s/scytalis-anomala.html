                    <h1>Scytalis anomala</h1>
<p>Scytalis anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its pale, translucent green leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swampy areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Scytalis anomala is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
