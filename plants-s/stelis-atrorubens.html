<p>Stelis atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a reddish tint. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red lip that adds to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Stelis atrorubens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth.</p>
