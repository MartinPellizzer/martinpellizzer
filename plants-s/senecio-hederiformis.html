                    <h1>Senecio hederiformis</h1>
<p>Senecio hederiformis, commonly known as the ivy-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with heart-shaped, lobed leaves that resemble ivy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period.</p>
