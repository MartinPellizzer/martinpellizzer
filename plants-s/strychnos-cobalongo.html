                    <h1>Strychnos cobalongo</h1>
<p>Strychnos cobalongo, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities, though it is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if mishandled.</p>
