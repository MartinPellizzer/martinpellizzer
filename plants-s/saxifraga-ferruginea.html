                    <h1>Saxifraga ferruginea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas where the climate is cool and moist. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves covered in a dense layer of rusty-brown hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga ferruginea is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient member of alpine flora.</p>
