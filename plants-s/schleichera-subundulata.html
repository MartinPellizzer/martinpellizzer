<p>Schleichera subundulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tallowwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its finely serrated, elongated leaves that are often arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it is valued for its hard, durable wood in traditional and contemporary woodworking.</p>
<p>Schleichera subundulata is also notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>
