                    <h1>Salix populoides</h1>
<p>Salix populoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2â€“6 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in flood-prone areas.</p>
