                    <h1>Saccharum elegans</h1>
<p>Saccharum elegans, commonly known as the slender bamboo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow leaves, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in wet or marshy environments, making it a common species in wetlands and riverbanks. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are attractive to pollinators.</p>
<p>While not as economically significant as other sugarcane species, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
