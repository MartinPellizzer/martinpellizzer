<p>Sempervivum percarneum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically forms dense, rosette-shaped clusters, with leaves that are often blue-green in color and may have a waxy coating. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months.</p>
<p>Sempervivum percarneum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
