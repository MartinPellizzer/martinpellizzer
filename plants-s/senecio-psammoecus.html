<p>Senecio psammoecus, commonly known as the sand dune groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Senecio psammoecus plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
