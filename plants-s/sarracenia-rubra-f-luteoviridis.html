<p>Sarracenia rubra f. luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a variant of Sarracenia rubra, characterized by its vivid yellow-green pitchers that are often tinged with red or orange at the base.
