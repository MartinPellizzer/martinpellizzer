<p>Stylidium irriguum, commonly known as the water triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to curl its leaves in response to touch, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Stylidium irriguum is an important species for ecological studies due to its adaptive features and role in local ecosystems.</p>
