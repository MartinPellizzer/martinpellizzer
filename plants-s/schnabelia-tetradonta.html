<p>Schnabelia tetradonta, commonly known as the four-toothed snub-nosed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique floral structure with four prominent teeth on the labellum, which is a distinctive feature in the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnabelia tetradonta is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
