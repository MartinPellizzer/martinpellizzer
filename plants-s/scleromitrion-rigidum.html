                    <h1>Scleromitrion rigidum</h1>
<p>Scleromitrion rigidum, commonly known as the rigid thornsteppe, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, thick, fleshy leaves that help conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its rigid, spiny structure provides protection from herbivores and aids in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Scleromitrion rigidum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting local wildlife and preventing soil erosion.</p>
