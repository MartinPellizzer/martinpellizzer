                    <h1>Stipa webberi</h1>
<p>Stipa webberi, commonly known as the Webber's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with long, silky bristles. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is typically bluish-green, and it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Stipa webberi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
