                    <h1>Salix orotchonorum</h1>
<p>Salix orotchonorum, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a species of willow native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It produces catkins as its reproductive structures, which are typical of the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
