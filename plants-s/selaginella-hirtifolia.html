<p>Selaginella hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiky appearance.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has whorled leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage.</p>
<p>Selaginella hirtifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
