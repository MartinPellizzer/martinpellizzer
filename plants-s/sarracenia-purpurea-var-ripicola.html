                    <h1>Sarracenia purpurea var. ripicola</h1>
<p>Sarracenia purpurea var. ripicola, commonly known as the riparian pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to wetlands and riparian zones in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, tubular pitchers that are typically red or purple in color. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using a sticky fluid inside its pitchers. Its leaves are modified into specialized structures that secrete digestive enzymes and attract prey with a sweet nectar.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor environments, making it an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
