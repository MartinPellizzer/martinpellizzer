                    <h1>Solanum warzcewiczoides</h1>
<p>Solanum warzcewiczoides, commonly known as the Warzcewicz's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Central and South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears yellow or orange berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its stems are woody and branching.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant chemistry.</p>
