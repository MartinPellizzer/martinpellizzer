<p>Santalodes macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large,革质 (leathery) leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>The wood of Santalodes macrophyllum is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in incense and perfumery.</p>
