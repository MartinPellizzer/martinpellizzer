                    <h1>Stellularia graminea var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Stellularia graminea var. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp star-grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent, and it produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Stellularia graminea var. uliginosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity.</p>
