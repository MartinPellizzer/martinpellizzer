<p>Saxifraga coriifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga coriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
