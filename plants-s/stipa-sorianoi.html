                    <h1>Stipa sorianoi</h1>
<p>Stipa sorianoi, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stipa sorianoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
