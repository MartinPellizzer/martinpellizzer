                    <h1>Sorbus foliolosa var. ursina</h1>
<p>Sorbus foliolosa var. ursina, commonly known as the bearberry rowan, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The berries are toxic to humans but are consumed by wildlife, contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
