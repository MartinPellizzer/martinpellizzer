<p>Stipa caucasica subsp.</p>
<p>desertorum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
