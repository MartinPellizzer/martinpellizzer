                    <h1>Sempervivum haworthii</h1>
<p>Sempervivum haworthii, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Sempervivum haworthii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
