<p>Sclerolaena deserticola, commonly known as the desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Sclerolaena deserticola is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
