                    <h1>Sedum bupleuroides var. discolor</h1>
<p>Sedum bupleuroides var. discolor, commonly known as the Variegated Stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with white or yellow markings, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This hardy perennial is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
