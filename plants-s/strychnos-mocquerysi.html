<p>Strychnos mocquerysi, commonly known as the Mexican poisonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans, though it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
