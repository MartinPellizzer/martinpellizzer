                    <h1>Salix skiaphila</h1>
<p>Salix skiaphila, commonly known as the shade willow, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salix skiaphila is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
