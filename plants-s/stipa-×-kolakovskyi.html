                    <h1>Stipa × kolakovskyi</h1>
<p>Stipa × kolakovskyi, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa viridula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-like flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically used for agricultural purposes but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
