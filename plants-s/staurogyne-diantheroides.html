<p>Staurogyne diantheroides, commonly known as the pink water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically pink or reddish in color, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that can help stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>Staurogyne diantheroides is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
