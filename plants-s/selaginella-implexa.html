                    <h1>Selaginella implexa</h1>
<p>Selaginella implexa, commonly known as the twisted spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Selaginella implexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
