                    <h1>Serapias lingua var. hirtula</h1>
<p>Serapias lingua var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy-tongued orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive "tongue" shape, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
