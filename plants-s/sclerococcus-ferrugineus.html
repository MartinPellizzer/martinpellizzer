                    <h1>Sclerococcus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Sclerococcus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty scab or rust fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Pucciniales and is characterized by its rust-colored pustules on the leaves of its host plants. The fungus produces asexual spores called aeciospores, which are dispersed by wind to infect new hosts. S. ferrugineus thrives in moist, temperate climates and can cause significant defoliation in susceptible tree species.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves multiple host plants and stages, making it a complex and persistent plant pathogen.</p>
