                    <h1>Saxifraga × engleri</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × engleri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitude.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
