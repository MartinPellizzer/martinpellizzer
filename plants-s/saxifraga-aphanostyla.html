                    <h1>Saxifraga aphanostyla</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aphanostyla, commonly known as the ghost saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are typically dense, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aphanostyla is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms a carpet-like ground cover.</p>
