<p>Senecio iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, are usually yellow or pale green, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio iljinii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
