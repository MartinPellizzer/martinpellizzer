<p>Scirpus numidianus, commonly known as the African bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus numidianus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water in aquatic habitats.</p>
