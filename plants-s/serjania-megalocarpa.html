<p>Serjania megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited serjania, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Serjaniae, which includes several species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically alternate and have a rough texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat.</p>
