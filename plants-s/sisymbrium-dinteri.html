                    <h1>Sisymbrium dinteri</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure that anchors it to the host. It is typically found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a parasite.</p>
