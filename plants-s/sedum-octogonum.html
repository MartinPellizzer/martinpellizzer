<p>Sedum octogonum, commonly known as the eight-sided stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum octogonum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
