                    <h1>Stipa hassei</h1>
<p>Stipa hassei, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa hassei is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
