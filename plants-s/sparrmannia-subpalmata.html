<p>Sparrmannia subpalmata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sparrmannia, is a member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or acidic environments.</p>
<p>Sparrmannia subpalmata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
