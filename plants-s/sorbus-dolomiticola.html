                    <h1>Sorbus dolomiticola</h1>
<p>Sorbus dolomiticola, commonly known as the Dolomite whitebeams, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Dolomites in northeastern Italy.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus dolomiticola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
