                    <h1>Salix schnelleriana</h1>
<p>Salix schnelleriana, commonly known as the Schneller's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
