                    <h1>Smythea macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Smythea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used by Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as an endangered species.</p>
