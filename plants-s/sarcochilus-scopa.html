<p>Sarcochilus scopa, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its large, tree-like structure with a central stem and a crown of fronds. The plant features a unique, thickened rhizome that supports its upright growth. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Sarcochilus scopa is also noted for its ability to produce spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
