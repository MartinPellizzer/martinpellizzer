                    <h1>Selago abietina</h1>
<p>Selago abietina, commonly known as the pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, greenish-gray crust on tree bark, particularly on coniferous trees like pines. The plant consists of a symbiotic partnership between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal component, which together carry out essential metabolic functions. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
