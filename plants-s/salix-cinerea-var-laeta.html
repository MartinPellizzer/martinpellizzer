<p>Salix cinerea var. laeta, commonly known as the white willow or silver willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale gray bark and slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, willow-like appearance. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive visual appeal. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used historically for its medicinal properties due to the salicin content in its bark.</p>
