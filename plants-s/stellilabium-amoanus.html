                    <h1>Stellilabium amoanus</h1>
<p>Stellilabium amoanus, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped labellum that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with a complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
