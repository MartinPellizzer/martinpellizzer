<p>Stemonurus corrugatus, commonly known as the wrinkled stemonurus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Stemonuraceae.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or brownish in color, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stemonurus corrugatus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
