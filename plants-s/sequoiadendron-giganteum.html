<p>Sequoiadendron giganteum, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet and diameters exceeding 15 feet. The tree has reddish-brown bark that is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Giant sequoias are long-lived, with some individuals estimated to be over 3,000 years old, making them one of the oldest living organisms on Earth.</p>
