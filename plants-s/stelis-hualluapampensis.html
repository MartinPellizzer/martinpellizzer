                    <h1>Stelis hualluapampensis</h1>
<p>Stelis hualluapampensis, commonly known as the Hualluapampa orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
