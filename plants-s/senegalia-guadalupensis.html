                    <h1>Senegalia guadalupensis</h1>
<p>Senegalia guadalupensis, commonly known as Guadalupine acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Senegalia guadalupensis plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in desert landscapes.</p>
