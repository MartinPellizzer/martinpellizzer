<p>Salix forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are narrowly elliptical with a bluish-green upper surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique form.</p>
