                    <h1>Spiranthes amabilis</h1>
<p>Spiranthes amabilis, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form a dense underground network, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its ecological significance.</p>
