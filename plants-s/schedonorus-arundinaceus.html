<p>Schedonorus arundinaceus, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense colonies, making it both ecologically valuable and potentially invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Schedonorus arundinaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
