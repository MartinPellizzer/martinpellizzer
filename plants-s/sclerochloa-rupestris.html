<p>Sclerochloa rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa rupestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
