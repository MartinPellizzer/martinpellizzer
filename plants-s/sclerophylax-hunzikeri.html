                    <h1>Sclerophylax hunzikeri</h1>
<p>Sclerophylax hunzikeri, commonly known as the Hunziker's sclerophyll, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or semi-arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Sclerophylax hunzikeri is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
