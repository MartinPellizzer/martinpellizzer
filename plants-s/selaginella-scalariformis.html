                    <h1>Selaginella scalariformis</h1>
<p>Selaginella scalariformis, commonly known as the scalloped spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive scalloped pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Selaginella scalariformis is notable for its ability to survive in drought conditions due to its thick, water-storing leaves.</p>
