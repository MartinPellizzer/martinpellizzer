                    <h1>Salix lispoclados</h1>
<p>Salix lispoclados, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix lispoclados is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
