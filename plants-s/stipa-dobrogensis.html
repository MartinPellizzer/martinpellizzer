<p>Stipa dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogoria grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a wiry texture, and it produces seeds in late summer.</p>
<p>Stipa dobrogensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
