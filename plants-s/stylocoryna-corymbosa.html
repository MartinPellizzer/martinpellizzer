                    <h1>Stylocoryna corymbosa</h1>
<p>Stylocoryna corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which provide essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and habitat, it is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests.</p>
