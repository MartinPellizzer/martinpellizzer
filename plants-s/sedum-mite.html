                    <h1>Sedum mite</h1>
<p>Sedum mite, commonly known as the rosemary mite, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae.</p>
<p>It primarily feeds on the sap of sedum plants, which are succulents known for their fleshy leaves and ability to store water. These mites are often found on the undersides of leaves, where they cause stippling and discoloration. They thrive in warm, dry conditions and can rapidly multiply, leading to significant damage if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The presence of sedum mites can be a sign of poor air circulation or overwatering in the plant's environment.</p>
