                    <h1>Stachys palustris var. arenicola</h1>
<p>Stachys palustris var. arenicola, commonly known as sand betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and gravelly habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
