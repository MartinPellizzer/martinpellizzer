                    <h1>Senegalia lobana</h1>
<p>Senegalia lobana, commonly known as the burro bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a thick, whitish coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legume-like pods containing edible seeds. Senegalia lobana is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>It also serves as a food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
