                    <h1>Sedum mucizonia</h1>
<p>Sedum mucizonia, commonly known as the sticky sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are thick and store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Sedum mucizonia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
