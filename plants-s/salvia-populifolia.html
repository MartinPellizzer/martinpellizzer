                    <h1>Salvia populifolia</h1>
<p>Salvia populifolia, commonly known as the Poplar-leaved Sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble the foliage of poplar trees, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is matched by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
