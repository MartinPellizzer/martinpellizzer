                    <h1>Strobilanthes bheriensis</h1>
<p>Strobilanthes bheriensis, commonly known as the Bheri's flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its unique floral structure includes two distinct types of flowers—showy, sterile ones and smaller, fertile ones—facilitating pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
