                    <h1>Seddera suffruticosa var. hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Seddera suffruticosa var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy seddera, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that provides moisture retention and protection against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
