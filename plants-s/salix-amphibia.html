                    <h1>Salix amphibia</h1>
<p>Salix amphibia, commonly known as the amphibious willow, is a shrub that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its roots help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Salix amphibia is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can survive in both submerged and exposed conditions.</p>
