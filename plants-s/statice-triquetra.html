                    <h1>Statice triquetra</h1>
<p>Statice triquetra, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Statice triquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in dried flower arrangements.</p>
