                    <h1>Silene maritima</h1>
<p>Silene maritima, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Silene maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
