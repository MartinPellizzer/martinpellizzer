                    <h1>Stellaria arenarioides</h1>
<p>Stellaria arenarioides, commonly known as sandstarweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Stellaria arenarioides is often found in rocky outcrops, gravel plains, and along coastal dunes.</p>
