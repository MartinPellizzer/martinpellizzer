<p>Strophanthus dichotomus var. marckii, commonly known as the red-stemmed African milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often red or purple in color, and its compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance, though caution is advised due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its tissues.</p>
