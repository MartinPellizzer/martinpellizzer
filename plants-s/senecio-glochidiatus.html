                    <h1>Senecio glochidiatus</h1>
<p>Senecio glochidiatus, commonly known as the glochidiate groundsel, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called glochidia, which provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
