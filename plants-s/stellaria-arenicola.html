                    <h1>Stellaria arenicola</h1>
<p>Stellaria arenicola, commonly known as sand starwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and disturbed areas. The plant has small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Stellaria arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
