<p>Solanum himatacanthum, commonly known as the red-stemmed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that mature to a deep purple color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and humans alike.</p>
