                    <h1>Sclerocactus uncinatus var. wrightii</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus uncinatus var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's hooked cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
