<p>Statice macphersonii, commonly known as MacPherson's sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Statice macphersonii is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
