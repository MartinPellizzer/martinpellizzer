<p>Sphaerostigma nitidum, commonly known as the glossy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Sphaerostigma nitidum is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on its specialized trapping mechanism for nutrient acquisition.</p>
