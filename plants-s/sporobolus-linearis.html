<p>Sporobolus linearis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its ability to spread via rhizomes allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Sporobolus linearis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
