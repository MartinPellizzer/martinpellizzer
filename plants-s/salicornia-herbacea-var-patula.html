                    <h1>Salicornia herbacea var. patula</h1>
<p>Salicornia herbacea var. patula, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries. The plant has jointed, fleshy stems that store water and salt, enabling it to survive in high-salinity conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
