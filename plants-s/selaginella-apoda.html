<p>Selaginella apoda, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, stoloniferous growth habit. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of bryophytes and some primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
