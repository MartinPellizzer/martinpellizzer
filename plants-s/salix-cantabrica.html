                    <h1>Salix cantabrica</h1>
<p>Salix cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that release minute seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal dunes, often tolerating salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
