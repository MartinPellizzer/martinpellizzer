                    <h1>Schismus minutus</h1>
<p>Schismus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf schismus, is a small annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, narrow leaves and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and rapid growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
