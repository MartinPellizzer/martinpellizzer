<p>Suaeda bacciformis, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, fleshy, red or orange fruits that are adapted to disperse seeds in harsh conditions. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling it to survive in drought-prone areas.</p>
<p>Suaeda bacciformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
