                    <h1>Sedum villosum var. arcticum</h1>
<p>Sedum villosum var. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic sedum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with extreme climate conditions.</p>
