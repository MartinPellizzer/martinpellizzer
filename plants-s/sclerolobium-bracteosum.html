<p>Sclerolobium bracteosum, commonly known as the silky bract acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Sclerolobium bracteosum is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
