                    <h1>Sambucus nigra f. albomarmorata</h1>
<p>Sambucus nigra f. albomarmorata, commonly known as the white-marbled elderberry, is a cultivar of the elderberry plant characterized by its distinctive white and cream-colored mottling on the foliage.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant features compound leaves with a serrated margin, often displaying a striking contrast between the marbled patterns and the dark green veins. The flowers, which appear in clustered umbels, are small and white, adding to the plant's visual appeal in late spring. It produces small, dark berries in the fall, though these are typically not edible due to their toxicity.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
