                    <h1>Sphaerostigma pallidum</h1>
<p>Sphaerostigma pallidum, commonly known as the pale sunburst fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with finely divided, light green fronds that give it a sunlit appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphaerostigma pallidum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
