                    <h1>Synurus diabolicus</h1>
<p>Synurus diabolicus, commonly known as the Devil's Spine, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, spiky leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, almost invisible hairs. The plant produces small, luminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark, a trait that has led to its mysterious reputation. Its roots are deeply embedded in the rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Botanists are still studying its unique adaptations, as it exhibits unusual resistance to both drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
