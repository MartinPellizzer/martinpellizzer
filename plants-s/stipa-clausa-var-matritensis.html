                    <h1>Stipa clausa var. matritensis</h1>
<p>Stipa clausa var. matritensis, commonly known as the Madrid needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential use in restoration projects.</p>
