<p>Salicornia, commonly known as glasswort or sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems that store water and salt. The plant produces small, green or red flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Salicornia is often used in culinary applications for its salty, crunchy texture.</p>
<p>It also plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
