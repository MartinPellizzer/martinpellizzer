<p>Salix polaris var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-barked willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silky hair, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and thrives in moist, often boggy environments.</p>
<p>This resilient plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
