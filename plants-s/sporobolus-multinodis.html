<p>Sporobolus multinodis, commonly known as the nodular spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often highly branched and form dense underground networks, contributing to its resilience in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus multinodis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
