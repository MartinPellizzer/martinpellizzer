                    <h1>Styloma insignis</h1>
<p>Styloma insignis, commonly known as the golden star lily, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable conditions. Styloma insignis thrives in well-drained, moist soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture.</p>
