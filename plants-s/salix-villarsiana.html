                    <h1>Salix villarsiana</h1>
<p>Salix villarsiana, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Salix villarsiana is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
