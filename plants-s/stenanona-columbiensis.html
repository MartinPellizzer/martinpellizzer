<p>Stenanona columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia stenanona, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight pubescence, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenanona columbiensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
