<p>Salsola tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>bungeana, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is used in some regions for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
