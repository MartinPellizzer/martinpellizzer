                    <h1>Stenopadus chimantensis</h1>
<p>Stenopadus chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant√© mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
