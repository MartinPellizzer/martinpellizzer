                    <h1>Sagittaria ovifolia</h1>
<p>Sagittaria ovifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or grow submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally through the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sagittaria ovifolia is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity.</p>
