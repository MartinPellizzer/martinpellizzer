                    <h1>Salix pratensis</h1>
<p>Salix pratensis, commonly known as the meadow willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant features slender, flexible stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Salix pratensis plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds.</p>
