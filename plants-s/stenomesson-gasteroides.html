                    <h1>Stenomesson gasteroides</h1>
<p>Stenomesson gasteroides, commonly known as the globular milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Stenomesson gasteroides plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>
