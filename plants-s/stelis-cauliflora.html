                    <h1>Stelis cauliflora</h1>
<p>Stelis cauliflora, commonly known as the orchid with clustered flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the tips of branches, a phenomenon known as cauliflory. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often small and fragrant, with a variety of colors including white, pink, and purple.</p>
<p>Stelis cauliflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural conditions.</p>
