                    <h1>Suaeda tomentosa</h1>
<p>Suaeda tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sea-blite, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are usually clustered in racemes, and it is often found in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Suaeda tomentosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
