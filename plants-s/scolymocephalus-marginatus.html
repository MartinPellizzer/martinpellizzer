                    <h1>Scolymocephalus marginatus</h1>
<p>Scolymocephalus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in shallow, often saline waters along coasts and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in fluctuating salinity and oxygen levels.</p>
