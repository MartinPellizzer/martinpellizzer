                    <h1>Stachyurus calcareus</h1>
<p>Stachyurus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone stachyurus, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in alkaline soils, which is reflected in its common name, as it is often found in limestone areas. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Stachyurus calcareus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban conditions.</p>
