                    <h1>Sipanea coppenamensis</h1>
<p>Sipanea coppenamensis, commonly known as the Coppenamens Island lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its growth is closely associated with particular substrates, such as bark or rock surfaces, and it plays a role in ecological succession in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments.</p>
