<p>Selaginella leoneensis, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Selaginella leoneensis is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
