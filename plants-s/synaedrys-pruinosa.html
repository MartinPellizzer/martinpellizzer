<p>Synaedrys pruinosa, commonly known as the waxy leaf shrub, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its unique leaf structure helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
