                    <h1>Sedum rodanthum</h1>
<p>Sedum rodanthum, commonly known as the desert rose or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late summer, which are borne on long, branching stems. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to drought conditions, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sedum rodanthum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
