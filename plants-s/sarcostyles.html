                    <h1>Sarcostyles</h1>
<p>Sarcostyles, commonly known as ghost flowers, are unique flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. These plants are native to parts of Asia and are often found in wet or marshy habitats. Sarcostyles have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Their botanical interest lies in their unusual appearance and ecological role in their native environments.</p>
