<p>Sorbus gracilis, commonly known as the slender whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Sorbus gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural landscapes.</p>
