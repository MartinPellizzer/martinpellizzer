<p>Sempervivum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, alkaline soils and is characterized by its compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces pink or red flowers in the summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid conditions.</p>
