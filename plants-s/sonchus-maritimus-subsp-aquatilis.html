<p>Sonchus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>aquatilis, commonly known as water sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and wet environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in brackish or freshwater habitats, often found in marshes, estuaries, and along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural settings.</p>
