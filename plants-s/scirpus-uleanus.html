                    <h1>Scirpus uleanus</h1>
<p>Scirpus uleanus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-chambered spikelets that contain the seeds. The plant typically grows in moist to water-saturated soils, often forming dense tussocks that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Scirpus uleanus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
