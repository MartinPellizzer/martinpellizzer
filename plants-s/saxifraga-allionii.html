                    <h1>Saxifraga allionii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga allionii, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, windy environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga allionii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, mountainous conditions.</p>
