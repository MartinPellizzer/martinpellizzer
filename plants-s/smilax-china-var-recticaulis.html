<p>Smilax china var. recticaulis, commonly known as the Chinese smilacina, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>

Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
