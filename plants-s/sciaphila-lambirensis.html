                    <h1>Sciaphila lambirensis</h1>
<p>Sciaphila lambirensis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat loss, Sciaphila lambirensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
