<p>Salix desertorum var. wolfii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that helps reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
