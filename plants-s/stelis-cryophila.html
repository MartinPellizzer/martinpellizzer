                    <h1>Stelis cryophila</h1>
<p>Stelis cryophila, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adapted to attract pollinators in its alpine habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, which is crucial for survival in its harsh climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Stelis cryophila is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
