                    <h1>Salix pseudoaurita</h1>
<p>Salix pseudoaurita, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-white down on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female, facilitating wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>The silver willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
