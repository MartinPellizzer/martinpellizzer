<p>Sclerotiaria pentaceros, commonly known as the five-pointed coral fungus, is a rare and distinctive member of the family Coriolaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, branched, coral-like structure and a pale yellow to orange coloration. The fruiting body typically develops in clusters, with a sponge-like texture and a slightly sticky surface. It grows on decaying wood in temperate forests, often in association with coniferous trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species to identify and study.</p>
