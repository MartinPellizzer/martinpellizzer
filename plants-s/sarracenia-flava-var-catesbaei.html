                    <h1>Sarracenia flava var. catesbaei</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava var. catesbaei, commonly known as the yellow swamp pitcher plant, is a variant of the yellow pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are typically shorter and wider than those of the typical S. flava, and they often have a distinctive red or orange rim. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its striking coloration and is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
