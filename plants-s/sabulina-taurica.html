                    <h1>Sabulina taurica</h1>
<p>Sabulina taurica, commonly known as the Crimean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapting to the arid and sandy soils of its habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is well-suited to dry, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Sabulina taurica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
