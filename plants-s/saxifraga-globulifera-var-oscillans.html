                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera var. oscillans</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera var. oscillans, commonly known as the rockfoil or mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its oscillating growth pattern, where the stems bend and sway in the wind, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
