                    <h1>Spiranthes spiralis</h1>
<p>Spiranthes spiralis, commonly known as the spiral spike orchid, is a native North American orchid species characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers along a single, slender stem.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Spiranthes spiralis is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
