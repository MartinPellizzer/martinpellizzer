                    <h1>Stelis bicarinata</h1>
<p>Stelis bicarinata, commonly known as the two-ribbed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating water retention.</p>
<p>Stelis bicarinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
