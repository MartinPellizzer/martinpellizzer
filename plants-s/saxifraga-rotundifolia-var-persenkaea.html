                    <h1>Saxifraga rotundifolia var. persenkaea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga rotundifolia var. persenkaea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers emerging from rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
