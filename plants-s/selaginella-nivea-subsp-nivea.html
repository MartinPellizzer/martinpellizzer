<p>Selaginella nivea subsp.</p>
<p>nivea, commonly known as the white spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern ally native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
