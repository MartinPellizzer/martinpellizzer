                    <h1>Swainsona procumbens var. minor</h1>
<p>Swainsona procumbens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swainsona, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine, soft hairs, adapting to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions.</p>
