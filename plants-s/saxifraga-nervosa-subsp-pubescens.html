<p>Saxifraga nervosa subsp.</p>
<p>pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage helps to reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather conditions.</p>
