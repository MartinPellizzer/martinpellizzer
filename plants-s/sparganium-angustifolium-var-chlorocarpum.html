                    <h1>Sparganium angustifolium var. chlorocarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium angustifolium var. chlorocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into bur-like fruits, which are adapted for dispersal by water or animals. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish hue, and the stems are usually erect and somewhat flexible.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Sparganium species but is distinguished by its unique fruit color and morphology.</p>
