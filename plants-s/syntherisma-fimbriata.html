<p>Syntherisma fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fimbriated (fringed) petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Syntherisma fimbriata is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
