                    <h1>Schizorhiza</h1>
<p>Schizorhiza, commonly known as the split-root plant, is a unique genus within the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive root system, which splits into two separate structures, allowing for efficient nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its specialized morphology. Schizorhiza species often have small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and survival strategies.</p>
