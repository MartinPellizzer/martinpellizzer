                    <h1>Sciaphila flosculosa</h1>
<p>Sciaphila flosculosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures called flosculi, which are not true flowers but specialized growths that aid in photosynthesis. Sciaphila flosculosa thrives in shaded, humid environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
