                    <h1>Selaginella hyalogramma</h1>
<p>Selaginella hyalogramma, commonly known as the glassy spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate stem with erect, spiky leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a glassy appearance. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>Selaginella hyalogramma is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique morphological adaptations for water conservation.</p>
