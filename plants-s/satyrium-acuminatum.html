<p>Satyrium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a single, small, greenish-white flower. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grassy slopes. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
