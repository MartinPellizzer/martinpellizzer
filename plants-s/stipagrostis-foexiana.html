                    <h1>Stipagrostis foexiana</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis foexiana, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis foexiana is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
