<p>Sarcanthus ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan starling orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vivid combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests, often on the bark of trees or in rocky crevices. Its small, delicate leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single inflorescence with several blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus ridleyi is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
