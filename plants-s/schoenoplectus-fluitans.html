                    <h1>Schoenoplectus fluitans</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus fluitans, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often float on the water's surface, supported by air-filled tissues that provide buoyancy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus fluitans plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
