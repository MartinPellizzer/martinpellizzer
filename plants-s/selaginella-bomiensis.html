                    <h1>Selaginella bomiensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella bomiensis, commonly known as the Bomi sprout moss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, fern-like leaves and a short, upright stem. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
