                    <h1>Senecio cydoniifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio cydoniifolius, commonly known as the pineapple lily, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
