<p>Scirpus californicus var. chamissoi, commonly known as the Chamisso's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in wetland environments such as marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
