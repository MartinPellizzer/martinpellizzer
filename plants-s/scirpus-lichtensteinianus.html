<p>Scirpus lichtensteinianus, commonly known as the Lichtenstein's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in wetland environments, making it a common sight in marshes and along water bodies.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall aquatic appearance.</p>
