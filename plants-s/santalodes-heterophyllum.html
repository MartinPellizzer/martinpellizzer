                    <h1>Santalodes heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Santalodes heterophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemi-epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants but derives most of its nutrients from the air, water, and rain. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ability to adapt to various substrates and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
