<p>Semiliquidambar coriacea, commonly known as the roughshank maple, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its wood is dense and hard, making it valuable for furniture and tool-making.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
