<p>Selaginella involvens f. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form.</p>
<p>It features delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
