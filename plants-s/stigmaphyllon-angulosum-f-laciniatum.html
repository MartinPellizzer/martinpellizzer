                    <h1>Stigmaphyllon angulosum f. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Stigmaphyllon angulosum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the jagged stigmaphyllon, is a unique bromeliad species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often jagged leaf blades that can reach several meters in length. The plant forms a rosette structure, with the leaves curving inward to create a central water-holding cavity, typical of bromeliads. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
