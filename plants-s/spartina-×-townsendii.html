                    <h1>Spartina × townsendii</h1>
<p>Spartina × townsendii, commonly known as the hybrid cordgrass, is a wetland plant native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Spartina alterniflora and Spartina foliosa, resulting in a plant that is often found in brackish tidal marshes. The plant has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Spartina × townsendii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
