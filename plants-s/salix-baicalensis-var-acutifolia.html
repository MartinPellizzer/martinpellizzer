                    <h1>Salix baicalensis var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Salix baicalensis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
