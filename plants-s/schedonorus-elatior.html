                    <h1>Schedonorus elatior</h1>
<p>Schedonorus elatior, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, some cultivars may contain toxic endophytic fungi, which can affect livestock grazing.</p>
