                    <h1>Sphaerospora</h1>
<p>Sphaerospora, commonly known as the "ball moss," is a genus of epiphytic plants belonging to the family Dendroceratops.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, spherical or globular appearance, which gives them their common name. They typically grow on tree trunks and branches, forming dense, moss-like clusters. Sphaerospora species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical structure consists of simple, leafless stems with small, scale-like leaves that help in water retention.</p>
