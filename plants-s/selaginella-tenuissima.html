                    <h1>Selaginella tenuissima</h1>
<p>Selaginella tenuissima, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spiky, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters, giving it a compact and moss-like appearance. The plant is known for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions due to its specialized adaptations, such as a thick cuticle and reduced leaf surface area. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Selaginella tenuissima is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
