<p>Sporobolus longibrachiatus, commonly known as the long-bracted spikerush, is a grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils with low nutrient content. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus longibrachiatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
