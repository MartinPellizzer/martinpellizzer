                    <h1>Solidago serotina var. dumertorum</h1>
<p>Solidago serotina var. dumertorum, commonly known as late goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow, composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, downy hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other goldenrod species but is distinguished by its specific habitat and floral structure.</p>
