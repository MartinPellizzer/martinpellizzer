                    <h1>Scleropogon</h1>
<p>Scleropogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Scleropogon species are typically found in moist or wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. They have rhizomatous growth, which allows them to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, contributing to their ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
