                    <h1>Salvadora persica</h1>
<p>Salvadora persica, commonly known as the toothbrush tree, is a small deciduous tree native to the arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties and as a natural toothbrush due to its antibacterial qualities.</p>
