<p>Synaedrys cuspidata, commonly known as the needleleaf sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Synaedrys cuspidata is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as dunes, gravel bars, and dry slopes.</p>
