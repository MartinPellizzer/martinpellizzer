<p>Sopropis palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's sotol, is a species of flowering plant in the family Xanthophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Sopropis palmeri produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
