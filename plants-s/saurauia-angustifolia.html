<p>Saurauia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saurauia, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>The small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
