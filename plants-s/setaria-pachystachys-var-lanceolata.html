                    <h1>Setaria pachystachys var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Setaria pachystachys var. lanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bulrush, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with lanceolate, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are its small, flowering structures, typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, contributing to its role as both a wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in some regions.</p>
