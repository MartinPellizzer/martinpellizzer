                    <h1>Sagina arctica f. laxa</h1>
<p>Sagina arctica f. laxa, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variant of Sagina arctica is notable for its resilience and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
