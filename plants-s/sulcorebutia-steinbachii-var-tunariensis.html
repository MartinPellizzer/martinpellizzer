                    <h1>Sulcorebutia steinbachii var. tunariensis</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia steinbachii var. tunariensis, commonly known as the Tunariensis Cactoblast, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Andes of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles, from which soft, woolly spines emerge. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
