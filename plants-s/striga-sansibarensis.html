                    <h1>Striga sansibarensis</h1>
<p>Striga sansibarensis, commonly known as the Tanzanian witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seeds that can remain dormant in soil for years. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting cereal crops like maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>Its ability to germinate in response to root exudates from host plants makes it a challenging weed to control.</p>
