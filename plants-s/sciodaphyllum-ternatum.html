                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum ternatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum ternatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, showy white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
