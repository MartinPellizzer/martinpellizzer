                    <h1>Sphacele codon</h1>
<p>Sphacele codon, commonly known as the spherical codon, is a hypothetical concept in molecular biology rather than a real plant.</p>
<p>It refers to a theoretical arrangement of nucleotides in the genetic code. While not a plant species, the term is sometimes misused in botanical discussions. The idea has no direct botanical counterpart in plant biology.</p>
<p>Therefore, it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
