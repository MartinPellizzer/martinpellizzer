                    <h1>Salix pentandra var. laxifolia</h1>
<p>Salix pentandra var. laxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and is often found in moist, riparian habitats. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaved willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
