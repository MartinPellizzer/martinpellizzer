                    <h1>Salix vulpina var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Salix vulpina var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
