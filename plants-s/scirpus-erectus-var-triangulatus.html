                    <h1>Scirpus erectus var. triangulatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus erectus var. triangulatus, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its triangular, hollow stems and dense, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The triangular cross-section of its stems is a distinctive feature that aids in its identification.</p>
