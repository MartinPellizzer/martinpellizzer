<p>Salix eriostroma, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>The silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
