                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. longirostra</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. longirostra, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the mud. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
