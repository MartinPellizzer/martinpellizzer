                    <h1>Stenomesson glareosum</h1>
<p>Stenomesson glareosum, commonly known as the golden tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stenomesson glareosum is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
