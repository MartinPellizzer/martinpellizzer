                    <h1>Salix kamtschatica</h1>
<p>Salix kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatskan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks, wet meadows, and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
