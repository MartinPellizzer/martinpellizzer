                    <h1>Salix depressa var. incubacea</h1>
<p>Salix depressa var. incubacea, commonly known as the dwarf willow or creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with slender, often red-tinged stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals.</p>
