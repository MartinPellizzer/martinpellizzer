                    <h1>Sideroxylon cuneatum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon cuneatum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon cuneatum is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making.</p>
