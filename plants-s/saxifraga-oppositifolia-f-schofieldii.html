                    <h1>Saxifraga oppositifolia f. schofieldii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia f. schofieldii, commonly known as the Schofield's rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, such as rocky slopes and tundra, where it forms dense mats to retain moisture and withstand strong winds. The plant's small, white or pink flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged habitat. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific adaptations to extreme cold and limited soil conditions.</p>
