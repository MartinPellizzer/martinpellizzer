                    <h1>Selaginella finitima</h1>
<p>Selaginella finitima, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, spiky foliage and its ability to survive in extreme drought conditions due to its specialized water-retention structures. Selaginella finitima is a resurrection plant, capable of surviving desiccation and reviving when moisture becomes available.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important subject in the study of plant resilience and evolutionary biology.</p>
