                    <h1>Sphaeritis typica</h1>
<p>Sphaeritis typica, commonly known as the typical spherical leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces unique plant galls on the leaves of certain shrubs.</p>
<p>The galls formed by this species are typically spherical or elongated and are composed of abnormal plant tissue, primarily from the leaves of plants in the genus *Chamaedorea*. These galls provide shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae of *Sphaeritis typica*. The plant's response to the insect's feeding triggers the formation of these galls, which are characteristic of the plant's defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>This interaction is a classic example of an insect-plant mutualism, where the plant's growth is altered in a specific and localized manner.</p>
