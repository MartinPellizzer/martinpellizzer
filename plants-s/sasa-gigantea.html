<p>Sasa gigantea, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant forms dense clumps through its rhizomatous growth system, creating thickets that are difficult to penetrate. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its culms are strong and fibrous.</p>
<p>Sasa gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional construction and crafts in its native habitats.</p>
