<p>Synaphea petiolaris subsp.</p>
<p>simplex, commonly known as the slender synaphea, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species.</p>
