                    <h1>Stelis signifera</h1>
<p>Stelis signifera, commonly known as the showy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Stelis signifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
