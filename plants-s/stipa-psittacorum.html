                    <h1>Stipa psittacorum</h1>
<p>Stipa psittacorum, commonly known as the gold feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear feathery, golden-yellow inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Stipa psittacorum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
