<p>Silene tenuis subsp.</p>
<p>iche-bogdo, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils typical of bogs and fens. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the moist, often waterlogged conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland environment.</p>
