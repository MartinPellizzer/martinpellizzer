                    <h1>Scabiosa maritima var. albida</h1>
<p>Scabiosa maritima var. albida, commonly known as the white coastal scabious, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs.</p>
