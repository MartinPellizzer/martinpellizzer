                    <h1>Salix repens var. argentea</h1>
<p>Salix repens var. argentea, commonly known as silver willow, is a variant of the creeping willow that features distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a soft, feathery texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are typical of willow species and serve as the primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
