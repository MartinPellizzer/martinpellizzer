<p>Saxifraga umbrosa var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh, alpine environment. This variety is closely related to the parent species, Saxifraga umbrosa, and shares similar ecological preferences.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in rocky or scree slopes where it forms a ground cover.</p>
