                    <h1>Spiranthes esmeraldae</h1>
<p>Spiranthes esmeraldae, commonly known as the emerald ladies' tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its flowering stem rises above the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
