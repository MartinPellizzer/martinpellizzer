                    <h1>Sedum dentatum</h1>
<p>Sedum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
<p>Sedum dentatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
