                    <h1>Syngonanthus lanatus var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus lanatus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
