                    <h1>Salix daltoniana</h1>
<p>Salix daltoniana, commonly known as Dalton's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
