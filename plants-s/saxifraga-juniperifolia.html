<p>Saxifraga juniperifolia, commonly known as the juniper-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often blue or greenish-gray leaves that resemble those of juniper. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga juniperifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
