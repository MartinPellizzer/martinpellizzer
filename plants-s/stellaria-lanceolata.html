                    <h1>Stellaria lanceolata</h1>
<p>Stellaria lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Stellaria lanceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate partial shade.</p>
