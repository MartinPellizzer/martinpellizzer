                    <h1>Serianthes robinsonii</h1>
<p>Serianthes robinsonii, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and filter out excess salt. Its small, white flowers are followed by dark, round fruits that contain a single seed, facilitating its limited dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this unique species.</p>
