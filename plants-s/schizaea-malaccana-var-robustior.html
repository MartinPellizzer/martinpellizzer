                    <h1>Schizaea malaccana var. robustior</h1>
<p>Schizaea malaccana var. robustior, commonly known as the robust forkmoss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a simple, non-vascular structure with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are not present, as it is a non-flowering plant.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various humid habitats.</p>
