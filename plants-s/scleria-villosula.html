<p>Scleria villosula, commonly known as the hairy spearplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom during the warmer months. Scleria villosula is often found in damp or marshy habitats, where it thrives in wet, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and dense foliage make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
