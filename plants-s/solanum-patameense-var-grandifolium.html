                    <h1>Solanum patameense var. grandifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum patameense var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf nightshade, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers.</p>
