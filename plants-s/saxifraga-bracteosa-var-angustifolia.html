                    <h1>Saxifraga bracteosa var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bracteosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open, sunny environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments.</p>
