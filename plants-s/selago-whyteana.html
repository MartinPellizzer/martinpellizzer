                    <h1>Selago whyteana</h1>
<p>Selago whyteana, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal star, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. Selago whyteana is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, contributing to stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators in coastal ecosystems.</p>
