<p>Stylogyne fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salvinioideae and is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a complex root system that helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>Stylogyne fluminensis is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals and pollutants from the water.</p>
