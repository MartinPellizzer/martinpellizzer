                    <h1>Sedopsis carrissoana</h1>
<p>Sedopsis carrissoana, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding visual interest to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sedopsis carrissoana is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal care once established.</p>
