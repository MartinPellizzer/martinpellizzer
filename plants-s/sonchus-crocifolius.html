                    <h1>Sonchus crocifolius</h1>
<p>Sonchus crocifolius, commonly known as the hairy leaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble those of a dandelion. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and North America. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
