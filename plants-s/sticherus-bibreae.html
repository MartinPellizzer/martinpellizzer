                    <h1>Sticherus bibreae</h1>
<p>Sticherus bibreae, commonly known as the Bornean sticherus, is a rare moss species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat fleshy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sticherus bibreae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
