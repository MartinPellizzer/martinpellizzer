<p>Sagittaria macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Sagittaria macrophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
