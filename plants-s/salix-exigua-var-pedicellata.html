<p>Salix exigua var. pedicellata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow or weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that give it a weeping appearance, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist soils along streams, wetlands, and other water-adjacent habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental form make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control.</p>
