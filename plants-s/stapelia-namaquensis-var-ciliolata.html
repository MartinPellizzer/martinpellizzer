<p>Stapelia namaquensis var. ciliolata, commonly known as the Namaqua star, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia, which give it its specific variety name.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
