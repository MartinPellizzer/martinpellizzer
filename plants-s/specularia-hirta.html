                    <h1>Specularia hirta</h1>
<p>Specularia hirta, commonly known as the hairy speculum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, orb-shaped seed pods that split open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
