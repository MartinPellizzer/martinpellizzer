                    <h1>Senecio subulatus var. prostratus</h1>
<p>Senecio subulatus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>
