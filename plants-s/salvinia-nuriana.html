                    <h1>Salvinia nuriana</h1>
<p>Salvinia nuriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
