                    <h1>Stromatocactus</h1>
<p>Stromatocactus, commonly known as the "cork cactus," is a genus of cacti native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, segmented stems that are often covered in a waxy, cork-like layer, which helps reduce water loss. Stromatocactus species typically have spiny or bristly structures for protection against herbivores. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in their fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in the evening and are pollinated by moths and bats.</p>
