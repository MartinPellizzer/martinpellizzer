<p>Sium erectum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, muddy soils. Its hollow stems and finely divided leaves help distinguish it from similar species.</p>
<p>Sium erectum is also noted for its edible roots, though they are often less palatable than those of its relatives.</p>
