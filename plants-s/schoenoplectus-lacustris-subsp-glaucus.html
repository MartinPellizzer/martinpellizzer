<p>Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp.</p>
<p>glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or bluish in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
