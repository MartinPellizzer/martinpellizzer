<p>Salix × heteromera, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix schwerinii (a species from Central Asia). The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside.
