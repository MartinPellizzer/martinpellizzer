                    <h1>Sceptridium negeri</h1>
<p>Sceptridium negeri, commonly known as the Malay cliff fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky cliffs or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sceptridium negeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
