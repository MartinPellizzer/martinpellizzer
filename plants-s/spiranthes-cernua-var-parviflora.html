<p>Spiranthes cernua var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiraling arrangement of small, greenish-white flowers along its flowering stem. The plant produces a single, slender stem that rises from a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more clustered flowers compared to other Spiranthes species.</p>
