                            <h1>Sulla Flexuosa</h1>
<p>Sulla, scientifically known as Sulla flexuosa, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiky stalks and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Sulla flexuosa has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
