<p>Sedum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in calcium-rich soils, such as those found in limestone regions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or white, blooming in summer.</p>
<p>Sedum calcicola is often found in rocky crevices and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
