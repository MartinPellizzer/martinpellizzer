                    <h1>Solidago alpicola</h1>
<p>Solidago alpicola, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Solidago alpicola is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in extreme alpine conditions.</p>
