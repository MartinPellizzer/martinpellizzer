                    <h1>Spatalla nubicola</h1>
<p>Spatalla nubicola, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Spatalla nubicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
