<p>Salacia juradoi, commonly known as the Jurado's salacia, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and small, clustered leaves with a glossy green surface. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Salacia juradoi is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
