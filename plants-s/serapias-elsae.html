<p>Serapias elsae, commonly known as the Elsae's sandwort, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rockcress (Capparaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with distinctive red veins. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serapias elsae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
