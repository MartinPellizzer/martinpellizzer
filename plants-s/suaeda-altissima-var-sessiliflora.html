                    <h1>Suaeda altissima var. sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Suaeda altissima var. sessiliflora, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, saline conditions.</p>
