<p>Senegalia malacophylla, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by legume pods containing small, hard seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and forage in dry environments.</p>
<p>Senegalia malacophylla is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood.</p>
