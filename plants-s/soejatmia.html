<p>Soejatmia, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers that resemble flames. The plant has long, slender stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Soejatmia thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
