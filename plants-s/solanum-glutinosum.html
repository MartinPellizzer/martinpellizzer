<p>Solanum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which often emit a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and peppers.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is more often found in wild or cultivated settings as an ornamental or weed.</p>
