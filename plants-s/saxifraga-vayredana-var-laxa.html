<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range.</p>
