                    <h1>Saxifraga oligantha</h1>
<p>Saxifraga oligantha, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense cushions or mats to withstand harsh conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in early summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Saxifraga oligantha is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
