                    <h1>Sterculia nobilis var. subspontanea</h1>
<p>Sterculia nobilis var. subspontanea, commonly known as the coastal sterculia, is a tropical tree native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy soils along the coastline, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions.</p>
