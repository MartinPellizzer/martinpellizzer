                    <h1>Sempervivum undulatum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum undulatum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sempervivum undulatum is also known for its ability to survive harsh winter conditions, earning it the common name "perennial" or "everlasting.".</p>
