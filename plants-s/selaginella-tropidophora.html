                    <h1>Selaginella tropidophora</h1>
<p>Selaginella tropidophora, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure.</p>
<p>It features a distinct stem with spirally arranged leaves that are typically linear and pointed. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages.</p>
