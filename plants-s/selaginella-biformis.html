<p>Selaginella biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial, evergreen, and spore-bearing plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a creeping stem with upright, spirally arranged leaves that are often divided into two lobes. It produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of its stems, which are used for reproduction.</p>
<p>Selaginella biformis is adapted to survive in harsh environments due to its ability to retain water and resist desiccation.</p>
