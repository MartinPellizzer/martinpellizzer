<p>Schiedea hookeri var. acrisepala, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming once in its lifetime. It thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of the Haleakalā Crater, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival due to habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
