                    <h1>Saxifraga protensa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga protensa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga protensa is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in crevices where other plants struggle to survive.</p>
