                <h1>Selaginella myosuroides</h1>
<p>Selaginella myosuroides, commonly known as the horse-tail spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation and fire. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are released during the reproductive cycle. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important species in the study of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
