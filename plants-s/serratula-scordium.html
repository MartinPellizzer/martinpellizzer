<p>Serratula scordium, commonly known as the garlic weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the garlic-like scent of its leaves, which can be both a distinguishing feature and a potential allergen.</p>
