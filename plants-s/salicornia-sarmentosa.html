                    <h1>Salicornia sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Salicornia sarmentosa, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and estuaries.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that are often red or pink in color, which help it store water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it reproduces through seeds or vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Salicornia sarmentosa plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
