                    <h1>Seriola commutata</h1>
<p>Seriola commutata, commonly known as the blackfin tuna, is a marine fish rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It is a fast-growing, pelagic species found in tropical and temperate waters. The fish is characterized by its elongated body and dark dorsal coloring. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey.</p>
<p>Due to its economic value, it is widely targeted by commercial fisheries.</p>
