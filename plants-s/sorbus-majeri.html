                    <h1>Sorbus majeri</h1>
<p>Sorbus majeri, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sorbus majeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
