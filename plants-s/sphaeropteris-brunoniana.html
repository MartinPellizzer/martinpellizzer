                    <h1>Sphaeropteris brunoniana</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris brunoniana, commonly known as the Bornean cycads, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Sphaeropteris brunoniana is adapted to humid, warm climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
