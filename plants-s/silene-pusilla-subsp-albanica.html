<p>Silene pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>albanica, commonly known as the Albanian dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>
