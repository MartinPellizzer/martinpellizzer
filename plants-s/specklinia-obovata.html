<p>Specklinia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate pigmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are obovate in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections.</p>
