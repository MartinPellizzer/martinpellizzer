                    <h1>Sporobolus rigens</h1>
<p>Sporobolus rigens, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, stiff blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Wiregrass thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense stands makes it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species.</p>
