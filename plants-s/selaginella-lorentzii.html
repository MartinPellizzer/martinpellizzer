<p>Selaginella lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with upright, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the plant, and it produces microspores and megaspores for sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Selaginella lorentzii is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought due to its ability to enter a state of dormancy.</p>
