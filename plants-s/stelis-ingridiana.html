                    <h1>Stelis ingridiana</h1>
<p>Stelis ingridiana, commonly known as the Ingrid's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis ingridiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
