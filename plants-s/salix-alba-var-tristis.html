<p>Salix alba var. tristis, commonly known as white willow weeping, is a variant of the white willow tree characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and paler underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of moist soils.</p>
