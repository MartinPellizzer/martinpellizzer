                    <h1>Stipa rigidiseta</h1>
<p>Stipa rigidiseta, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming clumps or colonies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Stipa rigidiseta is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils.</p>
