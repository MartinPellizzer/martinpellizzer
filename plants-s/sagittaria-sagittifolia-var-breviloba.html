                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. breviloba</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety, with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that emerge above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
