                    <h1>Senecio sisymbriifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio sisymbriifolius, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
