<p>[WRONG START] Spatalllopsis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a striking example of adaptation to its humid, shaded environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Spatallopsis confusa is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
