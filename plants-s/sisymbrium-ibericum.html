<p>Sisymbrium ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has small, oval leaves that are often reduced or scale-like.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium ibericum is adapted to grow in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
