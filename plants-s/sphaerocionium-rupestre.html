                    <h1>Sphaerocionium rupestre</h1>
<p>Sphaerocionium rupestre, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to absorb moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Sphaerocionium rupestre is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
