<p>Sanicula chinensis f. paupera, commonly known as the Chinese sanicle, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Sanicula genus.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a delicate, fern-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species.</p>
