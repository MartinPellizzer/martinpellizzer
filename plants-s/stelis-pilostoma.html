                    <h1>Stelis pilostoma</h1>
<p>Stelis pilostoma, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the labellum.</p>
<p>Stelis pilostoma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth.</p>
