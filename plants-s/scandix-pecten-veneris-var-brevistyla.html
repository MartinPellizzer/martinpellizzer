<p>Scandix pecten-veneris var. brevistyla, commonly known as the "sea holly," is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble the shell of the Venus' flower basket. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Scandix pecten-veneris var. brevistyla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal climates.</p>
