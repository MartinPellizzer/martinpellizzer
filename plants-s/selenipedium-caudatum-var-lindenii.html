                    <h1>Selenipedium caudatum var. lindenii</h1>
<p>Selenipedium caudatum var. lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or roots. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
