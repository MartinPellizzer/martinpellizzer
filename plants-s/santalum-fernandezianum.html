                    <h1>Santalum fernandezianum</h1>
<p>Santalum fernandezianum, commonly known as the Fern√°ndez sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Andes of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is characterized by its woody, aromatic heartwood, which is highly valued for its fragrance. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces severe conservation challenges.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
