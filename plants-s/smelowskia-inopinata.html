<p>Smelowskia inopinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
