                    <h1>Stauropsis luchuensis</h1>
<p>Stauropsis luchuensis, commonly known as the Luchuan fern, is a rare species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stauropsis luchuensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
