<p>Struthiopteris binervis, commonly known as the two-veined wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive two-veined structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>Struthiopteris binervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
