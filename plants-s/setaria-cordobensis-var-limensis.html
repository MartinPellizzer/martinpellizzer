<p>Setaria cordobensis var. limensis, commonly known as the Limense Panicgrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bracted florets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland ecosystems.</p>
