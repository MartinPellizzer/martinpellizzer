                    <h1>Salix longiramea</h1>
<p>Salix longiramea, commonly known as the long-stemmed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture.</p>
