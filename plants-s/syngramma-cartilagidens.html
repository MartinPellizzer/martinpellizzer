                    <h1>Syngramma cartilagidens</h1>
<p>Syngramma cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilage-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are often clustered closely together.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
