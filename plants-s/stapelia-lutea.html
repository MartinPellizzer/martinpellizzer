<p>Stapelia lutea, commonly known as the yellow star of Africa, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia lutea is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
