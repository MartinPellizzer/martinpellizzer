                    <h1>Scirpus × osoreyamensis</h1>
<p>Scirpus × osoreyamensis, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that belongs to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Scirpus californicus and Scirpus acutus, characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus × osoreyamensis is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
