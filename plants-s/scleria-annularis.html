                    <h1>Scleria annularis</h1>
<p>Scleria annularis, commonly known as the ring sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Scleria annularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
