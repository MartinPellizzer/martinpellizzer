                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. puberulum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its tubers are generally smaller than those of the standard potato, with a slightly different texture and flavor profile. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares many genetic traits with other Solanum species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptation and genetic diversity.</p>
