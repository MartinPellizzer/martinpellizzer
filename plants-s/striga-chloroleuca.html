                    <h1>Striga chloroleuca</h1>
<p>Striga chloroleuca, commonly known as the white witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically targeting crops like sorghum and millet. Its life cycle involves producing small, white, egg-like structures called pseudogynidia, which are dispersed by wind or water. The plant's root system forms haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system, causing significant yield loss.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a major agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
