                    <h1>Stahlia maritima</h1>
<p>Stahlia maritima, commonly known as the sea stahlia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid coastal environments.</p>
<p>Stahlia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms.</p>
