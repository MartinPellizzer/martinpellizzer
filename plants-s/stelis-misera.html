<p>Stelis misera, commonly known as the mourning orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a faintly colored lip. Stelis misera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
