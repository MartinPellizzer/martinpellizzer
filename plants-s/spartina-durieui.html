<p>Spartina durieui, commonly known as Durieu's cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in brackish or saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Spartina durieui plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance and adaptability make it a key component of intertidal and estuarine ecosystems.</p>
