<p>Suaeda divaricata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf seepweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in coastal areas where other plants struggle.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive and hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>
