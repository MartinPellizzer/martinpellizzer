<p>Schedonorus deciduus, commonly known as the red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
