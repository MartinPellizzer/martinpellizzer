<p>Stylisma humistrata, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its root system helps stabilize the soil in marshy environments, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands.</p>
<p>Stylisma humistrata is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants, forming part of the diverse flora in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
