                    <h1>Siphoneranthemum tenellum</h1>
<p>Siphoneranthemum tenellum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
