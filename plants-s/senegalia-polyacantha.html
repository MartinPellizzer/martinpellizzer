                    <h1>Senegalia polyacantha</h1>
<p>Senegalia polyacantha, commonly known as the screwbean tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control and as a source of forage for wildlife.</p>
