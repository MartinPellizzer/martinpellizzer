                    <h1>Saussurea depsangensis var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Saussurea depsangensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the Tibetan sandarac, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, fibrous root system adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle, which bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological significance in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
