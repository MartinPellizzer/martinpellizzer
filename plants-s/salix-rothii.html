                    <h1>Salix rothii</h1>
<p>Salix rothii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. Salix rothii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
