<p>Stigmatopteris alloeoptera, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow fronds, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of black and green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in stigmas, a unique feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
