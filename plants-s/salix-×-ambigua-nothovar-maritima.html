                    <h1>Salix × ambigua nothovar. maritima</h1>
<p>Salix × ambigua nothovar. maritima, commonly known as the coastal willow, is a hybrid shrub native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along tidal flats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to coastal environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
