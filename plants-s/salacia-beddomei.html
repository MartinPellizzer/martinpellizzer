                    <h1>Salacia beddomei</h1>
<p>Salacia beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's salacia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other members of the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with a rough texture, and small yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salacia beddomei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
