<p>Salvia tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Salvia tuberifera is well-suited for rock gardens and dry climates due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
