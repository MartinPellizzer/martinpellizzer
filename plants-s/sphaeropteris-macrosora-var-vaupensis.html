                    <h1>Sphaeropteris macrosora var. vaupensis</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris macrosora var. vaupensis, commonly known as the Vaupene cycad, is a variant of the broad-leafed cycad native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This cycad is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and its role in the biodiversity of New Caledonia's flora.</p>
