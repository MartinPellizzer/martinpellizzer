                <h1>Salix caprea</h1>
<p>Salix caprea, commonly known as goat willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, slender branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Salix caprea is notable for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
