                    <h1>Sagittaria natans var. gracillima</h1>
<p>Sagittaria natans var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often found in marshes and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
