                    <h1>Stellaria villosa</h1>
<p>Stellaria villosa, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Stellaria villosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
