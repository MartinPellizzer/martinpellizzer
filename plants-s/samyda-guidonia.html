                    <h1>Samyda guidonia</h1>
<p>Samyda guidonia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
