<p>Senecio vernicosus, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Senecio vernicosus is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
