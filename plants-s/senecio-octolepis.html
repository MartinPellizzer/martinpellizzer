<p>Senecio octolepis, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a compact, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are usually blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by spherical, fluffy seed heads that give the plant its "snowflake" appearance.</p>
