                    <h1>Somera</h1>
<p>Somera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Somera is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
