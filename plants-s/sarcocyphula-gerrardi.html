                    <h1>Sarcocyphula gerrardi</h1>
<p>Sarcocyphula gerrardi, commonly known as the yellow cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive yellow, cup-shaped fruiting body.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on decaying wood or soil. The fungus is notable for its spore-producing structure, which is embedded within the cup-like receptacle. It plays a role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sarcocyphula gerrardi is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions with suitable microhabitats.</p>
