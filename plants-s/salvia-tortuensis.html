                    <h1>Salvia tortuensis</h1>
<p>Salvia tortuensis, commonly known as the twisted sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Salvia tortuensis is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
