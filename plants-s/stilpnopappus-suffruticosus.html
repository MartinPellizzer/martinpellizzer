                    <h1>Stilpnopappus suffruticosus</h1>
<p>Stilpnopappus suffruticosus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like species that typically grows in rocky soils and is well-adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments.</p>
