<p>Sphaeropuntia sphaerica subsp.</p>
<p>crassicylindrica, commonly known as the thick-stemmed barrel cactus, is a perennial cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that are thick and ribbed, which help it store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
