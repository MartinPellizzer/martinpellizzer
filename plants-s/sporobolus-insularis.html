                    <h1>Sporobolus insularis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus insularis, commonly known as the island spikerush, is a perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and pond margins. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Sporobolus insularis is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions.</p>
