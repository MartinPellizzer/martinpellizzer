<p>Scirpus jardinei, commonly known as the Jardine's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale brown flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Scirpus jardinei is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
