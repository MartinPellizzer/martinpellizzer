<p>Senecio maximowiczii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
