                    <h1>Spergula pallida</h1>
<p>Spergula pallida, commonly known as pale sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize open, sunny areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native range.</p>
