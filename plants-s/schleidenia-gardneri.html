                    <h1>Schleidenia gardneri</h1>
<p>Schleidenia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Schleidenia gardneri plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
