<p>Suaeda cavanillesiana, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Suaeda cavanillesiana plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
