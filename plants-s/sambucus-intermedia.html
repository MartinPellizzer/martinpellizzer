<p>Sambucus intermedia, commonly known as common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate with 5 to 9 leaflets, and its clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.
