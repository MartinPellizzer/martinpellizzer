<p>Salix anglorum var. antiplasta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, or damp woodlands.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting insect life.</p>
