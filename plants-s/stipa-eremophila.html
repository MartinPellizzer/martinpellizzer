                    <h1>Stipa eremophila</h1>
<p>Stipa eremophila, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and shrubsteppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
