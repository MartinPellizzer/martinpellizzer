<p>Stelis hygrophila, commonly known as the water-loving orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant typically features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to retain moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a delicate appearance that enhances its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Stelis hygrophila thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
