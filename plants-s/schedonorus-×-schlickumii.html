<p>Schedonorus × schlickumii, commonly known as the fine leaf fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in turfgrass applications due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The plant forms dense, sod-forming growth that is well-suited for lawns and erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Schedonorus × schlickumii is also valued for its ability to withstand foot traffic and its minimal need for fertilization.</p>
