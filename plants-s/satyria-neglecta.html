                    <h1>Satyria neglecta</h1>
<p>Satyria neglecta, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Satyria neglecta is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go through periods of dormancy during extreme drought conditions.</p>
