                    <h1>Silene saxifraga var. pseudosaxifraga</h1>
<p>Silene saxifraga var. pseudosaxifraga, commonly known as the false saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Native to rocky or alpine environments in Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
