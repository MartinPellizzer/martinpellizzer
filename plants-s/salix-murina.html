                    <h1>Salix murina</h1>
<p>Salix murina, commonly known as the common black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats, such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, willow-like branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Salix murina is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
