                    <h1>Suaeda fruticosa var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Suaeda fruticosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It features small, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, showcasing remarkable tolerance to high salinity and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and physiological adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
