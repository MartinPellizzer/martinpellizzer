<p>Salix kirilowiana, commonly known as the Kirilow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental qualities, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
