<p>Stellularia media var. terrestris, commonly known as the common starworts, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Stellularia media var. terrestris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
