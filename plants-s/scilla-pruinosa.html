<p>Scilla pruinosa, commonly known as the powdered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its powdery, waxy coating on the leaves and flower stems, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Scilla pruinosa is relatively low maintenance and adds a delicate, early blooming touch to gardens.</p>
