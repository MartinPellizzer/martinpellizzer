<p>Salix interior var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is often found in moist, open habitats such as streambanks and meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and narrower leaves compared to other willow species.</p>
