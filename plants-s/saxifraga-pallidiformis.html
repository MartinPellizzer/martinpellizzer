<p>Saxifraga pallidiformis, commonly known as the paleform saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga pallidiformis is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
