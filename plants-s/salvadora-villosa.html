                    <h1>Salvadora villosa</h1>
<p>Salvadora villosa, commonly known as the silky salvadora, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing small, hard seeds. Salvadora villosa is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
