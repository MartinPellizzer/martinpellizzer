                    <h1>Seruneum scaberrimum</h1>
<p>Seruneum scaberrimum, commonly known as the roughleaf seruneum, is a unique plant species characterized by its rugged, textured leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adding a subtle contrast to its rough foliage. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
