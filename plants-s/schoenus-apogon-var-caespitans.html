                    <h1>Schoenus apogon var. caespitans</h1>
<p>Schoenus apogon var. caespitans, commonly known as the tufted marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the base, creating a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in marshy or seasonally flooded environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
