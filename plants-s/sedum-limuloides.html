<p>Sedum limuloides, commonly known as the stonecrop or liveforever plant, is a succulent species native to arid and rocky regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum limuloides is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to prevent soil erosion in dry environments.</p>
