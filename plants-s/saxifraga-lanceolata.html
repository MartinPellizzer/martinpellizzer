<p>Saxifraga lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats.</p>
