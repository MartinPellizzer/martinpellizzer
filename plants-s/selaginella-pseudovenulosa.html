                    <h1>Selaginella pseudovenulosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella pseudovenulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features closely arranged, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Selaginella pseudovenulosa is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems.</p>
