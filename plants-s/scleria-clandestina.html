                    <h1>Scleria clandestina</h1>
<p>Scleria clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria clandestina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, though it remains relatively obscure in botanical literature.</p>
