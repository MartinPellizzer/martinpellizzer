                            <h1>Scaphyglottis Corallorrhiza</h1>
<p>Scaphyglottis corallorrhiza is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This unique species is known for its striking coral-like appearance and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family, which includes over 25,000 species worldwide. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly studied due to its limited distribution and elusive nature. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this fragile plant from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
