                            <h1>Salvia Cuspidata Subsp. Gilliesii</h1>
<p>Salvia cuspidata subsp. gilliesii is a lesser-known yet striking member of the mint family native to the mountainous regions of south-central Chile. This perennial herb is distinguished by its vibrant violet-blue flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated in the horticultural world. Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects.</p>
