                    <h1>Specklinia lepanthoides</h1>
<p>Specklinia lepanthoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
