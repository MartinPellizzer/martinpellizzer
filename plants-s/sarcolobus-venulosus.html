<p>Sarcolobus venulosus, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it uses its specialized organs to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Sarcolobus venulosus is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to thrive in moist, temperate environments.</p>
