<p>Sabinea dubia, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
