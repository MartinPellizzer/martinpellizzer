                    <h1>Selaginella rubicundipes</h1>
<p>Selaginella rubicundipes, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive reddish hue in its stems, which becomes more pronounced under certain environmental conditions. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is well adapted to survive in dry climates with minimal water availability. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among many ancient plant species.</p>
<p>Selaginella rubicundipes plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
