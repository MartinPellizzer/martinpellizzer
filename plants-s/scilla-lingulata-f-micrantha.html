                    <h1>Scilla lingulata f. micrantha</h1>
<p>Scilla lingulata f. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf squill, is a botanical variant of the genus Scilla, characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its foliage is often more dense and shorter than that of the standard Scilla lingulata.</p>
<p>This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>
