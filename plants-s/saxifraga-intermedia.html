<p>Saxifraga intermedia, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and have a distinctive waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga intermedia is well adapted to low-nutrient conditions and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats.</p>
