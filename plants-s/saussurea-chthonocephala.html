                    <h1>Saussurea chthonocephala</h1>
<p>Saussurea chthonocephala, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and a unique, tubular structure that resembles a ghostly head, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments with low oxygen levels, adapting to extreme altitudes and limited nutrients. Its limited distribution and fragile habitat make it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a symbol of resilience in some cultural contexts.</p>
