<p>Schlechterorchis, commonly known as the yellow adder's mouth, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, hood-like lip that resembles an adder's mouth. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Schlechterorchis has a short flowering period, usually in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
