                    <h1>Siphocampylus westinianus var. brevipedicellatus</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus westinianus var. brevipedicellatus, commonly known as the Westinian short-stemmed siphocampylus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status.</p>
