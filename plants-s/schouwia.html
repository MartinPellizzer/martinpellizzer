                    <h1>Schouwia</h1>
<p>Schouwia, commonly known as the "blue orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, often blue or violet-colored flowers. The plants typically grow as epiphytes, meaning they attach themselves to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Schouwia species have intricate floral structures with showy petals and sepals, and they are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species are threatened with extinction, making conservation efforts essential.</p>
