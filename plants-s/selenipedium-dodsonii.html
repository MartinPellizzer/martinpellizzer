<p>Selenipedium dodsonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, typically appearing in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, water, and light. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its slow growth, Selenipedium dodsonii is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
