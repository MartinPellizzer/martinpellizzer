                    <h1>Syntherisma gracillima</h1>
<p>Syntherisma gracillima, commonly known as the delicate feather fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing clusters, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Syntherisma gracillima is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
