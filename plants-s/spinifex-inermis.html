<p>Spinifex inermis, commonly known as the sandhill spinifex, is a species of grass found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and poor soil quality. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
<p>Spinifex inermis is also valued for its aesthetic appeal in native landscaping.</p>
