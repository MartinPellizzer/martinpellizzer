                    <h1>Salix × bifax</h1>
<p>Salix × bifax, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix viminalis (osier dogwood), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
