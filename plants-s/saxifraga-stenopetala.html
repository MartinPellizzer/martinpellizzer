<p>Saxifraga stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
