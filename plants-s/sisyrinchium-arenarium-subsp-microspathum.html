<p>Sisyrinchium arenarium subsp.</p>
<p>microspathum, commonly known as the sandflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies microspathum is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Sisyrinchium arenarium.</p>
