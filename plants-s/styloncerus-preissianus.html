                    <h1>Styloncerus preissianus</h1>
<p>Styloncerus preissianus, commonly known as the African forest styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the tropical regions of Africa, where it inhabits dense forest ecosystems. The beetle's body is typically elongated and cylindrical, with a hard exoskeleton that provides protection against predators. Its diet mainly consists of plant material, though specific host plants are not well documented.</p>
<p>This species plays a minor role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the decomposition process and nutrient cycling.</p>
