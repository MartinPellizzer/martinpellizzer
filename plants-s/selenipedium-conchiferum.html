                <h1>Selenipedium conchiferum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium conchiferum, commonly known as the giant spiny lily, is a striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiky leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a thick, fleshy rhizome and a tall, slender stem. Selenipedium conchiferum is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study.</p>
