<p>Saxifraga bryomorpha, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, moist environments and is often found in alpine tundras. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, which help it retain moisture. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are typically pink or white in color.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bryomorpha plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for cold climates.</p>
