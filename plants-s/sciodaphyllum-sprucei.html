                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum sprucei</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum sprucei, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen foliage and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, particularly in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Sciodaphyllum sprucei plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
