                    <h1>Spiraea menziesii f. eriophylla</h1>
<p>Spiraea menziesii f. eriophylla, commonly known as the pink spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant spring foliage and delicate floral display.</p>
