                    <h1>Stephanococcus</h1>
<p>Stephanococcus, commonly known as the scale insect, is a genus of small, sap-sucking insects that belong to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>These pests are notorious for infesting a wide variety of plants, including ornamentals, fruit trees, and shrubs. They feed on plant sap, often causing deformation, discoloration, and reduced growth in their host plants. Stephanococcus species are typically found in clusters on the stems, leaves, or branches of their host plants.</p>
<p>Their presence can also lead to the secretion of honeydew, which may promote the growth of sooty mold.</p>
