<p>Stisseria mastodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies solely on its roots for absorption of moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are white and bell-shaped, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
