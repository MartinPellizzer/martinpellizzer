                    <h1>Santalodes concolor</h1>
<p>Santalodes concolor, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the western Pacific region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many parts of its natural habitat.</p>
