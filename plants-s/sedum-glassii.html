<p>Sedum glassii, commonly known as the glassy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
