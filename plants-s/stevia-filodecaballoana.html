                    <h1>Stevia filodecaballoana</h1>
<p>Stevia filodecaballoana, commonly known as the "horseman's stevia," is a rare and lesser-known species within the Stevia genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Unlike its more commercially recognized relative, Stevia rebaudiana, Stevia filodecaballoana has not been widely cultivated for its sweet leaves, but it holds potential for future botanical research and use.</p>
