                    <h1>Stenandrium neesianum</h1>
<p>Stenandrium neesianum, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, red berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and rimu, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. It derives some of its nutrients from the host but can also perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
