<p>Sarcocaulon patersonii subsp.</p>
<p>curvatum, commonly known as the Curved Sarcocaulon, is a unique and rare subshrub native to South Australia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dense, woody stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
