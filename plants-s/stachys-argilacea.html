                    <h1>Stachys argilacea</h1>
<p>Stachys argilacea, commonly known as clayplant or stickyweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Stachys argilacea is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
