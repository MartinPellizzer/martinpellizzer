                    <h1>Salix glabrescens</h1>
<p>Salix glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in riparian habitats.</p>
