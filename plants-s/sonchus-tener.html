<p>Sonchus tener, commonly known as slender sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Sonchus tener is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
