<p>Sporobolus indicus subsp.</p>
<p>purpureosuffusus, commonly known as purple-stemmed sandbur, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear purple or reddish hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spiny seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a feature typical of the genus Sporobolus. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-gray appearance that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
