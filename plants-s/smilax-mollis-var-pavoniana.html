                    <h1>Smilax mollis var. pavoniana</h1>
<p>Smilax mollis var. pavoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
