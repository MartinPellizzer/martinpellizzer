                    <h1>Santalodes glabrum</h1>
<p>Santalodes glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its valuable wood and ecological role, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
