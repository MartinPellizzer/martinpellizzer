                    <h1>Salix caespitosa</h1>
<p>Salix caespitosa, commonly known as the cottongrass willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Salix caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
