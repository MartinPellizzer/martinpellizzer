<p>Sarcochilus wightii, commonly known as the Wight's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, translucent leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus wightii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
