                    <h1>Stelis condorensis</h1>
<p>Stelis condorensis, commonly known as the Andean stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis condorensis is often found in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>
