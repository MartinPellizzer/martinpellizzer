                    <h1>Salix wilhelmsiana var. wilhelmsiana</h1>
<p>Salix wilhelmsiana var. wilhelmsiana, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in colder climates.</p>
