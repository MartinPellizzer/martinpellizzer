<p>Salix commutata subsp.</p>
<p>mixta, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its flexible, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist or wet environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, greenish fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically elongated, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
