                    <h1>Spergula marginata var. pycnorrhiza</h1>
<p>Spergula marginata var. pycnorrhiza, commonly known as narrowleaf sandfat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, and its small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in clusters during the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and limited water conditions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly areas, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in dryland habitats.</p>
