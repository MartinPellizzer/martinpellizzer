                    <h1>Sedum thartii</h1>
<p>Sedum thartii, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rocky surfaces, where it can access minimal soil and moisture. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or white, blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Sedum thartii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
