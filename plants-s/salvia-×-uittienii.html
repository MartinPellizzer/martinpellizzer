<p>Salvia × uittienii, commonly known as the hybrid sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Salvia nemorosa and Salvia rosmarinus, resulting in a plant with striking violet-blue flower spikes. The foliage is aromatic, with lance-shaped leaves that have a minty scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from early summer to late autumn.</p>
