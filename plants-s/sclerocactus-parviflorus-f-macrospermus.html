                    <h1>Sclerocactus parviflorus f. macrospermus</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus parviflorus f. macrospermus, commonly known as the large-seeded small-flowered cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique characteristic is the large, fleshy seeds it produces, which are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal care.</p>
