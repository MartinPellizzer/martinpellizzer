                    <h1>Selenipedium × stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × stenophyllum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a snake, giving it its genus name "Selenipedium," which means "moon snake.". The hybrid is a cross between Selenipedium album and Selenipedium stenophyllum, resulting in a plant with distinctive floral morphology and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
