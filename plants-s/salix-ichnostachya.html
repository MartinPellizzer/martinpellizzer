                    <h1>Salix ichnostachya</h1>
<p>Salix ichnostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
