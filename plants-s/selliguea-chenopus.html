<p>Selliguea chenopus, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort found in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rock surfaces, adapting to harsh conditions with its thick, waxy cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Selliguea chenopus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
