<p>Setaria imberbis f. uberior, commonly known as the thick-leaved millet, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often thick and fleshy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
