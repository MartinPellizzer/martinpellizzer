<p>Sedum albescens, commonly known as the silver sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
