<p>Stelis costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican stelis, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, including Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Colombia.</p>
<p>Stelis costaricensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
