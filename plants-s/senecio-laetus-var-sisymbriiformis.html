<p>Senecio laetus var. sisymbriiformis, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features silver-white, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
