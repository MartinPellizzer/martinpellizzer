<p>Salsola kali subsp.</p>
<p>rosacea, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish-gray flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is highly drought-tolerant, thriving in poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
