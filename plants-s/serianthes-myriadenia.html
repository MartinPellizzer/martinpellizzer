                    <h1>Serianthes myriadenia</h1>
<p>Serianthes myriadenia, commonly known as the "ghost tree," is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a distinctive, umbrella-like canopy that gives it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a sweet scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Serianthes myriadenia is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
