<p>Sarracenia purpurea f. plena, commonly known as the plena pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, vibrant red to purple pitcher-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using its modified leaves, which secrete digestive enzymes. The plena form is distinguished by its more intense coloration and denser venation compared to the typical S. purpurea.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
