<p>Salix aquilonia, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its distinctive silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, often peeling in thin layers, and it is adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Salix aquilonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
