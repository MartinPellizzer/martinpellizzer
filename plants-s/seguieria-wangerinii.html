                    <h1>Seguieria wangerinii</h1>
<p>Seguieria wangerinii, commonly known as the Wangerin's seguieria, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Seguieria wangerinii is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
