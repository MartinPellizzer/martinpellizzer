<p>Stenotheca tristis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. It is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecological interactions.</p>
