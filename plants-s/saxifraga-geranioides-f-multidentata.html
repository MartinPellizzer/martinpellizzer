<p>Saxifraga geranioides f. multidentata, commonly known as the multi-toothed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
