                    <h1>Senegalia lujae</h1>
<p>Senegalia lujae, commonly known as the Lujan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia lujae is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
