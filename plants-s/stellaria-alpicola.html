                    <h1>Stellaria alpicola</h1>
<p>Stellaria alpicola, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Stellaria alpicola is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
