                    <h1>Selaginella apothecium</h1>
<p>Selaginella apothecium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy stems and spore-producing structures called strobila, which are often clustered in dense, cone-like formations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its life cycle involves both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage, with the sporophyte producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Selaginella apothecium is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies.</p>
