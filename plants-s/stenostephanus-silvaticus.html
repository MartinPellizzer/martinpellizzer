                    <h1>Stenostephanus silvaticus</h1>
<p>Stenostephanus silvaticus, commonly known as the forest stephanus, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, highlighting its role in maintaining biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Stenostephanus silvaticus is now considered critically endangered.</p>
