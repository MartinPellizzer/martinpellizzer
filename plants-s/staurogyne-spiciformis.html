<p>Staurogyne spiciformis, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Halocarpyceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters along the stems. Staurogyne spiciformis is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality and is sometimes used as an indicator species in ecological assessments.</p>
