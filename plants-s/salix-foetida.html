<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color.

Salix foetida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
