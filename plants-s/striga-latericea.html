                    <h1>Striga latericea</h1>
<p>Striga latericea, commonly known as the desert witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that primarily infests grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments, it poses a challenge for sustainable farming in affected areas.</p>
