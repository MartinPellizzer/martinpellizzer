                    <h1>Selaginella vonroemeri</h1>
<p>Selaginella vonroemeri, commonly known as the von Roemeri spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that produce spores. Native to the arid regions of Namibia, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a unique ability to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its harsh environment, including a compact growth form and reduced water loss mechanisms.</p>
<p>Selaginella vonroemeri is of significant interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and ecological resilience.</p>
