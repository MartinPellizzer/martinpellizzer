<p>Salix shihtsuanensis var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile willow, is a variant of the Shihtsuan willow native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
