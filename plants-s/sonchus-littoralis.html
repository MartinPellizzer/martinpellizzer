<p>Sonchus littoralis, commonly known as coastal sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along coastlines.</p>
<p>Sonchus littoralis is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
