                    <h1>Sphenostigma</h1>
<p>Sphenostigma, commonly known as the "spleenwort," is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant's spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Sphenostigma species are often found in temperate regions and are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
