<p>Stelis asperilinguis, commonly known as the warty-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, wiry stem covered with rough, warty protuberances, which give it its common name. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, typically arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often clustered in a raceme.</p>
