                    <h1>Strobilanthes glabrata</h1>
<p>Strobilanthes glabrata, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale or white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Strobilanthes glabrata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
