                    <h1>Salsola glauca</h1>
<p>Salsola glauca, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, fleshy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Salsola glauca is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
