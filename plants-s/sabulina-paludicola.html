                    <h1>Sabulina paludicola</h1>
<p>Sabulina paludicola, commonly known as the marsh saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Sabulina paludicola plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>
