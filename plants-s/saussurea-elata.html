<p>Saussurea elata, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saussurea elata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine.</p>
