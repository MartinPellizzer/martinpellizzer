<p>Sporobolus micranthus subsp.</p>
<p>bernieri, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bristly spikelets that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind due to the presence of awns. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in low-nutrient, drought-prone environments.</p>
