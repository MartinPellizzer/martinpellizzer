<p>Sedum vermiculifolium, commonly known as the worm-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in both gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
