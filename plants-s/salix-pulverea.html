                    <h1>Salix pulverea</h1>
<p>Salix pulverea, commonly known as the powdered willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain salicin, a compound similar to aspirin, which has been used traditionally for its analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Salix pulverea is well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats.</p>
