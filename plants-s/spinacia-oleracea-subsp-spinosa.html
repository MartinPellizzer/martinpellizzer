<p>Spinacia oleracea subsp.</p>
<p>spinosa, commonly known as the spinous spinach, is a lesser-known subspecies of spinach native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves, which give it its common name and set it apart from the more familiar smooth-leafed spinach varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with upright stems and a rosette of leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Despite its unique appearance, it is less commonly cultivated than other spinach subspecies but is valued for its hardiness and nutritional content.</p>
