<p>Segetella vulgaris, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green, floating leaves that are divided into three narrow lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant typically grows in dense mats on the water surface, often in still or slow-moving water bodies. Segetella vulgaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
<p>It is a perennial species that spreads through vegetative reproduction, forming extensive colonies in suitable conditions.</p>
