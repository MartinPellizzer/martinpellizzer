                    <h1>Straussia glomerata</h1>
<p>Straussia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is found in various regions, typically in open, disturbed habitats where its host plants thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions, though it is not widely cultivated or studied.</p>
