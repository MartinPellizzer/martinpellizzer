<p>Stipa parviflora subsp.</p>
<p>sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai dwarf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the Sinai Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens and landscapes.</p>
