<p>Sedum telephium, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum telephium is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
