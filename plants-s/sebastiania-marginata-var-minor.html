<p>Sebastiania marginata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sebastiania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded foliage with thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish or bronze tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for container gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant.</p>
