<p>Sporobolus rigens var. atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama spikerush, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
