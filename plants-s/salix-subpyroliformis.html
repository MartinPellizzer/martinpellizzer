<p>Salix subpyroliformis, commonly known as the subpyroliform willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Salix subpyroliformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
