                    <h1>Salix glaucops</h1>
<p>Salix glaucops, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and can become fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Salix glaucops is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
