<p>Sporobolus densiflorus, commonly known as denseflower sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray sheen that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus densiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
