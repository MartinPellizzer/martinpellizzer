<p>Salix lucida f. lasiandra, commonly known as the white willow, is a variant of the common willow species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, preferring well-drained to wet soils.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has historical medicinal uses.</p>
