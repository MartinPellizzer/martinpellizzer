The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
