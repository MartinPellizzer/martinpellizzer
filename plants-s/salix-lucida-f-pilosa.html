<p>Salix lucida f. pilosa, commonly known as the downy willow, is a variant of the silky willow native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, downy appearance. The plant typically grows along streambanks and wetlands, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its catkins are an important food source for pollinators, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The foliage provides habitat for various insects and contributes to the ecological diversity of riparian zones.</p>
