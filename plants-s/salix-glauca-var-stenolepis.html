                    <h1>Salix glauca var. stenolepis</h1>
<p>Salix glauca var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
