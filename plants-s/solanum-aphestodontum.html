                    <h1>Solanum aphestodontum</h1>
<p>Solanum aphestodontum, commonly known as the ghost pepper plant, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green fruits that mature to a bright red color. The plant produces a variety of alkaloids, some of which are responsible for its intense heat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its high capsaicin content, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for consumption by most people.</p>
