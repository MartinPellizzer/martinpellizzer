<p>Sabatia maritima, commonly known as sea bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, salty soils along the Atlantic coast, often found in dunes and beach habitats. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Sabatia maritima plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
