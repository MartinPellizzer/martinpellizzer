                    <h1>Scolosanthus howardii</h1>
<p>Scolosanthus howardii, commonly known as the Howard's scolosanthus, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scolosanthus howardii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
