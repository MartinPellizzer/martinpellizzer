                    <h1>Stenocereus fimbriatus</h1>
<p>Stenocereus fimbriatus, commonly known as the Mexican bird of paradise, is a cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and showy, spadix-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has sharp, spiny leaves that are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple center, attracting pollinators like bats and birds.</p>
<p>Stenocereus fimbriatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
