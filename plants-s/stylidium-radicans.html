<p>Stylidium radicans, commonly known as the wandering carpet plant, is a unique member of the Commelinaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adapted for pollination by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense carpets, especially in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Stylidium radicans is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
