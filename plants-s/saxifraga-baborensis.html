                    <h1>Saxifraga baborensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga baborensis, commonly known as the Baborensis saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, typically between June and August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
