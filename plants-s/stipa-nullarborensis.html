<p>Stipa nullarborensis, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Stipa nullarborensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
