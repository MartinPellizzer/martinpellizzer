                    <h1>Scleria catalinae</h1>
<p>Scleria catalinae, commonly known as Catalina marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and tidal flats, where it thrives in brackish or freshwater conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-chambered spikelets that contain its characteristic three seeds. Scleria catalinae is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates the health of wetland environments and its conservation status is a focus of ecological studies in the region.</p>
