                    <h1>Syntherisma leiantha</h1>
<p>Syntherisma leiantha, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are small, thick, and covered in a silvery, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
