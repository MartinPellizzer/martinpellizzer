<p>Stipa sanluisensis var. longispicula, commonly known as the long-spined needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
