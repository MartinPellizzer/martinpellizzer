<p>Sclerophylax spinescens, commonly known as the spiny sclerophyll, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and prominent spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive, often fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>Sclerophylax spinescens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
