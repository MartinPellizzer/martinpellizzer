                    <h1>Sphinctanthus rupestris</h1>
<p>Sphinctanthus rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sphinctanthus rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
