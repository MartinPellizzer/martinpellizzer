                    <h1>Stanhopea cephalopoda</h1>
<p>Stanhopea cephalopoda, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically a vibrant combination of purple and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Stanhopea cephalopoda is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
