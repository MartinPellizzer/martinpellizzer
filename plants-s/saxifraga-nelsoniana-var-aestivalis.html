                    <h1>Saxifraga nelsoniana var. aestivalis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nelsoniana var. aestivalis, commonly known as the summer saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
