                    <h1>Salix attenuata</h1>
<p>Salix attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams and wetlands. Salix attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
