<p>Syzygium kinabaluense subsp.</p>
<p>kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu apple, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
