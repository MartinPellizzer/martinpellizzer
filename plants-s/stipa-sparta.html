                    <h1>Stipa sparta</h1>
<p>Stipa sparta, commonly known as Spanish needle or goat's beard, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of bristly, spike-like flowers that resemble small needles. The plant produces a distinctive inflorescence composed of several spikelets, each with a single floret covered in fine, barbed hairs. Stipa sparta thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
