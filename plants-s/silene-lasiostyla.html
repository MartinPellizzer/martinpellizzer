                    <h1>Silene lasiostyla</h1>
<p>Silene lasiostyla, commonly known as the woolly catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, a common adaptation in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Silene lasiostyla is often found in rocky soils and is a component of alpine vegetation communities.</p>
