                    <h1>Solanum lechnoviczii var. xerophyllum</h1>
<p>Solanum lechnoviczii var. xerophyllum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming at night. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe, contain toxic alkaloids and are not edible for humans or animals.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in xeric conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh, semi-desert habitats.</p>
