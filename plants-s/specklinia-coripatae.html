                    <h1>Specklinia coripatae</h1>
<p>Specklinia coripatae, commonly known as the coral spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. It features compact, pseudobulbous stems with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are small, fragrant, and usually pink or purple, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
