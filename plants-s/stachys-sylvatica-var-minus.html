                    <h1>Stachys sylvatica var. minus</h1>
<p>Stachys sylvatica var. minus, commonly known as narrow-leaved wood betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is less showy than the typical form of Stachys sylvatica but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
