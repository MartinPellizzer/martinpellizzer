                    <h1>Salvia chionophylla</h1>
<p>Salvia chionophylla, commonly known as the snowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a frosty appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>
