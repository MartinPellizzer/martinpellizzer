                    <h1>Schiedea globosa var. graminifolia</h1>
<p>Schiedea globosa var. graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like Schiedea, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or volcanic soils. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
