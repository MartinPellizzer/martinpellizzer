                    <h1>Solidago vulgaris var. saulei</h1>
<p>Solidago vulgaris var. saulei, commonly known as the lesser goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other goldenrod species but is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit.</p>
