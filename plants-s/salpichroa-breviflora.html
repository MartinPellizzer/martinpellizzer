                    <h1>Salpichroa breviflora</h1>
<p>Salpichroa breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with grayish-green, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Salpichroa breviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
