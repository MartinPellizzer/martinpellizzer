<p>Salicornia obscura, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, depending on the species. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Salicornia obscura plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
