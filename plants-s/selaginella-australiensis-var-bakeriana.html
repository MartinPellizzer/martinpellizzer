                    <h1>Selaginella australiensis var. bakeriana</h1>
<p>Selaginella australiensis var. bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's spikemoss, is a rare and delicate vascular plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is also considered a conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
