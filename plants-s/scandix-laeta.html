                    <h1>Scandix laeta</h1>
<p>Scandix laeta, commonly known as the golden scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Scandix laeta is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, northern environments.</p>
