The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
