The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
