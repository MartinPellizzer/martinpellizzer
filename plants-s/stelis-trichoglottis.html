<p>Stelis trichoglottis, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with distinctive hairy structures on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis trichoglottis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral characteristics.</p>
