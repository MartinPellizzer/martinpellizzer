                    <h1>Smallanthus maculatus</h1>
<p>Smallanthus maculatus, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces legume pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a traditional food source by indigenous communities. Smallanthus maculatus is adapted to high-altitude environments and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a food source and a component of the local ecosystem.</p>
