<p>Strychnos xerophila, commonly known as the desert strychnos, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often grayish bark. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments through features such as thick leaves and deep root systems. It produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky coating.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but is of interest in ecological studies.</p>
