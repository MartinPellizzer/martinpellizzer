                    <h1>Schizopetalon</h1>
<p>Schizopetalon, commonly known as the "buttercup" or "buttercup plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five to ten petals. The leaves are typically palmately divided, giving the plant a delicate and fern-like appearance. Schizopetalon species are often found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>These plants are known for their attractive blooms but can be toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of protoanemonin.</p>
