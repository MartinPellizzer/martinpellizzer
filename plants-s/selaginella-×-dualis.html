                    <h1>Selaginella × dualis</h1>
<p>Selaginella × dualis, commonly known as the hybrid spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is a naturally occurring hybrid between Selaginella lepidophylla and Selaginella distorta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and the ability to produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions. Selaginella × dualis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying plant adaptation to stressful environments.</p>
