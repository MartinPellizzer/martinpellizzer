                    <h1>Stelis petiolaris</h1>
<p>Stelis petiolaris, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, wiry stem with clustered, small, white to pale green flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Stelis petiolaris thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
