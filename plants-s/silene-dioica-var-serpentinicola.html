                    <h1>Silene dioica var. serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Silene dioica var. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine lady's mantle, is a rare flowering plant adapted to grow in serpentine soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers on separate plants, making it monoecious. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcium-rich environments and is often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for serpentine ecosystems.</p>
