                    <h1>Stoebe disticha</h1>
<p>Stoebe disticha, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Stoebe disticha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats make it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
