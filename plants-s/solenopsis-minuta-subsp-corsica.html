<p>Solenopsis minuta subsp.</p>
<p>corsica, commonly known as the Corsican fire ant, is a small, reddish-brown ant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender body and long, slender legs, typical of many ant species.</p>
<p>The plant it inhabits, though not a plant itself, is often found in grassy or shrubby habitats, where it forages for food. Its colonies are known for their aggressive behavior and ability to form large, complex nests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a pest in some regions outside its native range.</p>
