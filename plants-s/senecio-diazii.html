                    <h1>Senecio diazii</h1>
<p>Senecio diazii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor, sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio diazii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
