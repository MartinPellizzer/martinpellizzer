<p>Stenocephalum megapotamicum, commonly known as the Argentine ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>
