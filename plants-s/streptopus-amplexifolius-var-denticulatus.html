                    <h1>Streptopus amplexifolius var. denticulatus</h1>
<p>Streptopus amplexifolius var. denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its species name *amplexifolius*. The flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Streptopus.</p>
