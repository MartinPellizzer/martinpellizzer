                    <h1>Suaeda aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Suaeda aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or barren areas.</p>
<p>Suaeda aegyptiaca plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
