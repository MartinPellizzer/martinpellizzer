                    <h1>Senecio scopulinus</h1>
<p>Senecio scopulinus, commonly known as the mountain groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in open grasslands or among shrubs. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Senecio scopulinus is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
