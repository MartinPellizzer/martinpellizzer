<p>Salix myrsinites subsp.</p>
<p>serrata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, serrated, and typically have a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.</p>
