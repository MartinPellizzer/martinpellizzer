<p>Solanum horridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Its leaves are covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture.</p>
<p>Solanum horridum contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
