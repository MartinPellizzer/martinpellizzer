<p>Saxifraga tabularis, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga tabularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
