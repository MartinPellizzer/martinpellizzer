<p>Sapium cupuliferum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by orange-yellow fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
