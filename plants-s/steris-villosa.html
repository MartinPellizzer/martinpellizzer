<p>Steris villosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Steris villosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
