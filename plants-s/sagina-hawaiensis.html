<p>Sagina hawaiensis, commonly known as Hawaiian sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas, particularly on sandy or gravelly soils, and thrives in well-drained environments. The plant has tiny, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Sagina hawaiensis is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, making it an important component of its native flora.</p>
