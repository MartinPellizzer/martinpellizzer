                    <h1>Sambucus coriacea</h1>
<p>Sambucus coriacea, commonly known as common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared properly before consumption.</p>
<p>Sambucus coriacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
