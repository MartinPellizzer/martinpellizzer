<p>Sparganium ramosum subvar. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, typically growing in dense clusters at the water's edge. The plant produces yellowish-green flower spikes that appear in late summer, followed by spiky, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
