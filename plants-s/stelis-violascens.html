                    <h1>Stelis violascens</h1>
<p>Stelis violascens, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pleasant fragrance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis violascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
