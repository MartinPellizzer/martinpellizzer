                    <h1>Sutera flexuosa</h1>
<p>Sutera flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
