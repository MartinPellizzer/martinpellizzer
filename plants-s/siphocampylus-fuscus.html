<p>Siphocampylus fuscus, commonly known as the dark siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates.</p>
