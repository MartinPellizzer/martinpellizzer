                <h1>Schizaea boninensis</h1>
<p>Schizaea boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin spleenwort, is a rare epiphytic fern belonging to the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Schizaea boninensis is native to the Bonin Islands and is adapted to grow on trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
