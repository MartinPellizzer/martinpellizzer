                    <h1>Scleria aquatica</h1>
<p>Scleria aquatica, commonly known as water spikerush, is a wetland plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often submerged or nearly so.</p>
<p>Scleria aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
