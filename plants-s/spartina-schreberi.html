                    <h1>Spartina schreberi</h1>
<p>Spartina schreberi, commonly known as the smooth cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as tidal marshes and saltwater wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Spartina schreberi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
