                    <h1>Sorghum roxburghii var. hirsutum</h1>
<p>Sorghum roxburghii var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy sorghum, is a robust, drought-tolerant grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, coarse leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, whitish to purplish flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important forage crop in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stalks are used for livestock feed, while the seeds can be processed into flour or used as a food source in some cultures.</p>
