<p>Sartidia isaloensis, commonly known as the Isalo fern, is a unique plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps it attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sartidia isaloensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
