                    <h1>Sciaphila hermaphrodita</h1>
<p>Sciaphila hermaphrodita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance, with small, white flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. Sciaphila hermaphrodita is a hermaphroditic species, possessing both male and female reproductive organs in its flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
