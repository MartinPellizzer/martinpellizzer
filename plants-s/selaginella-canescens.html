<p>Selaginella canescens, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a vascular fern that thrives in arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Selaginella canescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
