                    <h1>Stipa pappiformis</h1>
<p>Stipa pappiformis, commonly known as the silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear feathery, pappus-equipped seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments.</p>
<p>Stipa pappiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
