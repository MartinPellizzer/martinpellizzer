<p>Sedum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
