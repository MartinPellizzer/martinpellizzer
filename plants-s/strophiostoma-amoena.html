<p>Strophiostoma amoena, commonly known as the beautiful spiraled sea snail, is a species of gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Trochidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell, which is typically smooth and glossy with a distinct, elongated aperture. The shell coloration can vary, often displaying shades of brown, pink, or yellow, depending on the individual and its environment. This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, where it inhabits rocky substrates and algae-covered surfaces.</p>
<p>Its anatomy includes a well-developed radula for scraping food from surfaces, and it plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a predator and prey.</p>
