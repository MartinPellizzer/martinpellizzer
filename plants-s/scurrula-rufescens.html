                    <h1>Scurrula rufescens</h1>
<p>Scurrula rufescens, commonly known as the red-bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on its upper surface.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is often covered with a powdery layer of spores. This lichen typically grows on tree bark, especially on coniferous trees, in humid and shaded environments. Its structure consists of a fungal component that hosts various algae or cyanobacteria, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Scurrula rufescens is widely distributed in temperate regions and is an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
