                    <h1>Sapindus vitiensis</h1>
<p>Sapindus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis soapnut, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical fruits that split open to reveal a single seed.</p>
<p>Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of a saponin-rich outer layer on its fruit, which is used in traditional soap-making and as a natural detergent.</p>
