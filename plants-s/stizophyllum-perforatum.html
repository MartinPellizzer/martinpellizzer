<p>Stizophyllum perforatum, commonly known as the perforate stizophyllum, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy shoots and the presence of perforations in its thallus, which are small holes that aid in gas exchange. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its structure consists of a central stem with closely packed, spirally arranged leaves.</p>
<p>Stizophyllum perforatum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
