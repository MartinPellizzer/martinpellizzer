<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a white, fleshy aril. It is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, and its growth habit makes it a valuable component of local ecosystems.</p>
