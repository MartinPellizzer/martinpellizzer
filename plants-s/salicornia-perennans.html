                    <h1>Salicornia perennans</h1>
<p>Salicornia perennans, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in coastal environments with high salinity.</p>
<p>It is a succulent perennial that forms dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically inconspicuous and arranged in clusters. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are rich in moisture, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Salicornia perennans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
