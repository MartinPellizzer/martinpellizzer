                    <h1>Salsola australis var. strobilifera</h1>
<p>Salsola australis var. strobilifera, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny leaves that reduce water loss and aid in deterring herbivores. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its ability to flourish in extreme conditions, supporting local wildlife and maintaining habitat diversity.</p>
