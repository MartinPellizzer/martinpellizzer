                    <h1>Selaginella eurystachya</h1>
<p>Selaginella eurystachya, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of true ferns, though it is not a fern but a spikemoss. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella eurystachya exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized structures.</p>
<p>Its reproductive system involves the production of microspores and megaspores, which are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
