                    <h1>Sophora gypsophila</h1>
<p>Sophora gypsophila, commonly known as the desert false indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sophora gypsophila is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed landscapes.</p>
