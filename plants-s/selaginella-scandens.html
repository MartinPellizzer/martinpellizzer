                    <h1>Selaginella scandens</h1>
<p>Selaginella scandens, commonly known as stair-step moss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form tight, compact clusters. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis, where it enters a dormant state. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices and forest floors.</p>
<p>Selaginella scandens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
