<p>Sesbania hamata, commonly known as the bristly sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
