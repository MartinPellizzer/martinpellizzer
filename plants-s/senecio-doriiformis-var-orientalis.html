                    <h1>Senecio doriiformis var. orientalis</h1>
<p>Senecio doriiformis var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
