                    <h1>Selaginella crinita</h1>
<p>Selaginella crinita, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant features whorled, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Selaginella crinita produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in arid conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
