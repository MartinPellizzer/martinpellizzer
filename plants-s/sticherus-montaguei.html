<p>Sticherus montaguei, commonly known as the Montague's sticherus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a leafy, flattened body that is often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surface of the thallus and produce spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Sticherus montaguei is primarily found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats.</p>
