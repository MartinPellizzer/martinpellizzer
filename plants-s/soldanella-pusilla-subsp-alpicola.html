<p>Soldanella pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>alpicola, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>The plant features tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora.</p>
