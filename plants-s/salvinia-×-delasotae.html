                    <h1>Salvinia × delasotae</h1>
<p>Salvinia × delasotae, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salvinia molesta and Salvinia minima.</p>
<p>It is a free-floating aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate can lead to ecological imbalances by outcompeting native species for light and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic aquatic weed in many regions.</p>
