                    <h1>Sciadophila</h1>
<p>Sciadophila, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds. The plants typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Sciadophila species have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help in spreading vegetatively.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
