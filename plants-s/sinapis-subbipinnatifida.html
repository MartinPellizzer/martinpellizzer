<p>Sinapis subbipinnatifida, commonly known as the double-pinnate mustard, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its bi- or tri-pinnate leaves, which are deeply divided and give it a feathery appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in siliques, which are elongated pods that split open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
