                    <h1>Sida occidentalis</h1>
<p>Sida occidentalis, commonly known as seaside mallow, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fibrous root system is adapted to stabilize itself in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
<p>Sida occidentalis is often found in dunes, marshes, and other coastal habitats where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions.</p>
