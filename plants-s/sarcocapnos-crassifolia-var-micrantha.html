                    <h1>Sarcocapnos crassifolia var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Sarcocapnos crassifolia var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sarcocapnos, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
