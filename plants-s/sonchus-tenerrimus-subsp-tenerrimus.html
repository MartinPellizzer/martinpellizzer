<p>Sonchus tenerrimus subsp.</p>
<p>tenerrimus, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and desert margins.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid ecosystems.</p>
