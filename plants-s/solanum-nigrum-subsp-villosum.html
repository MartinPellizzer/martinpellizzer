<p>Solanum nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>villosum, commonly known as the hairy black nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name "villosum.".</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark purple or black berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
