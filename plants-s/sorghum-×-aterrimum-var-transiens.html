                    <h1>Sorghum × aterrimum var. transiens</h1>
<p>Sorghum × aterrimum var. transiens, commonly known as hybrid sorghum, is a cross between sorghum and millet, exhibiting traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>It is a tall, annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles that produce small, clustered flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it suitable for marginal agricultural lands. Its seeds are used for grain, fodder, and sometimes as a source of biofuel.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity and adaptability, which contribute to its agricultural significance.</p>
