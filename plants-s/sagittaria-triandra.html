                    <h1>Sagittaria triandra</h1>
<p>Sagittaria triandra, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with narrow, ribbon-like leaves submerged beneath the water. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Sagittaria triandra is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
