<p>Solanum fastigiatum var. acicularium, commonly known as the needleleaf nightshade, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important species such as tomatoes and potatoes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
