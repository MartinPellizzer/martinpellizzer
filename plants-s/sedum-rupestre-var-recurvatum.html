                    <h1>Sedum rupestre var. recurvatum</h1>
<p>Sedum rupestre var. recurvatum, commonly known as the Rock Sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 9.</p>
