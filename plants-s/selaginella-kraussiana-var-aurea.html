<p>Selaginella kraussiana var. aurea, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a rare and striking variant of the maidenhair fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright golden-green leaves, which contrast beautifully with the typical darker green of the standard species. This plant is native to South Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its delicate, lace-like fronds make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings.</p>
