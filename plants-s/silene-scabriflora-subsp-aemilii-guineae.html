<p>Silene scabriflora subsp.</p>
<p>aemilii-guineae, commonly known as the Guinean sandstem, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
