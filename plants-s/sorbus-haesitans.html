<p>Sorbus haesitans, commonly known as the hesitating whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions.</p>
