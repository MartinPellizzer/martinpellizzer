<p>Salix retusa subsp.</p>
<p>serpillifolia, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, lance-shaped, and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in streambanks and desert washes.</p>
