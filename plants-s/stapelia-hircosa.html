                    <h1>Stapelia hircosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia hircosa, commonly known as the goat's foot plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble the shape of a goat's foot, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Stapelia hircosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
