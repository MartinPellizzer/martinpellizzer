                    <h1>Strobila</h1>
<p>Strobila, commonly known as the sorus, is a specialized structure found in certain ferns and mosses that houses the sporangia, which produce spores.</p>
<p>It is typically located on the underside of the fronds in ferns and plays a crucial role in the plant's reproductive cycle. The strobila is often clustered in groups, forming a visible and distinctive feature of the plant. Its structure varies among species, but it generally consists of a protective covering over the sporangia.</p>
<p>This botanical feature is essential for the dispersal of spores and the propagation of the plant.</p>
