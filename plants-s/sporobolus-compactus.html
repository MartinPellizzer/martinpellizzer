                    <h1>Sporobolus compactus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus compactus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus compactus is well adapted to grazing and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
