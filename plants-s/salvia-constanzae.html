                    <h1>Salvia constanzae</h1>
<p>Salvia constanzae, commonly known as Constanza's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
