<p>Stelis connata, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis connata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at higher elevations.</p>
