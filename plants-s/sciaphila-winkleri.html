<p>Sciaphila winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or among dense foliage. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it highly susceptible to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Sciaphila winkleri is considered a conservation concern.</p>
