<p>Stellera altaica var. minor, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
