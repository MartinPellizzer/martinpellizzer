                    <h1>Striga flava</h1>
<p>Striga flava, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds are highly resilient and can remain viable in soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crop yields, Striga flava is a significant concern in regions where it infests staple food crops.</p>
