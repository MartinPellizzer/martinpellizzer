                    <h1>Striga humilis</h1>
<p>Striga humilis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the roots of the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, annual life cycle. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent challenge for farmers.</p>
