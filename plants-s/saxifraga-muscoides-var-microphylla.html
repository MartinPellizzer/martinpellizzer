                    <h1>Saxifraga muscoides var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Saxifraga muscoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are often borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its significantly smaller leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
