                    <h1>Spirochaeta funckii</h1>
<p>Spirochaeta funckii, commonly known as the spiral-shaped bacterium, is a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium that derives energy from inorganic compounds.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive helical shape and is often found in anaerobic environments such as freshwater sediments and soils. This bacterium plays a role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing ammonia. It is a Gram-negative organism with a complex cell wall structure.</p>
<p>Spirochaeta funckii is of interest in biotechnology due to its unique metabolic capabilities.</p>
