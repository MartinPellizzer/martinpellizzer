                    <h1>Stapelia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia verrucosa, commonly known as the疣茎肉质植物, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Stapelia verrucosa is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
