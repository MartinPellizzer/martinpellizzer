<p>Stipagrostis gonatostachys, commonly known as the African lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in compact clusters, with lemmas that are typically hairy and lanceolate in shape. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis gonatostachys is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in grazing systems.</p>
