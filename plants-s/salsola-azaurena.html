                    <h1>Salsola azaurena</h1>
<p>Salsola azaurena, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, blue-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Salsola azaurena is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>It is often found in steppe, grassland, and coastal dunes, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
