                    <h1>Steireya</h1>
<p>Steireya, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Steireya contains toxic compounds, including thujone, which makes it harmful to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a repellent for pests.</p>
