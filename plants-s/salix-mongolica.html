                    <h1>Salix mongolica</h1>
<p>Salix mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>Salix mongolica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
