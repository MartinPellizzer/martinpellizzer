<p>Salicornia europaea var. pachystachya, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
