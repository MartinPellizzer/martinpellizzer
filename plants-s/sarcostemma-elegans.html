<p>Sarcostemma elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is a common feature among plants in the milkweed family.</p>
<p>Sarcostemma elegans is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
