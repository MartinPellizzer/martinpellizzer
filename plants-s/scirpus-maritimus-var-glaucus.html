                    <h1>Scirpus maritimus var. glaucus</h1>
<p>Scirpus maritimus var. glaucus, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in marshes and estuaries along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in filtering water and preventing erosion in tidal zones.</p>
