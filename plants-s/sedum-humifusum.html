                    <h1>Sedum humifusum</h1>
<p>Sedum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Sedum humifusum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
