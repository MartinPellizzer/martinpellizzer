                    <h1>Sedum argutum</h1>
<p>Sedum argutum, commonly known as the sharpleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
