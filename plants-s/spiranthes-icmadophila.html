                    <h1>Spiranthes icmadophila</h1>
<p>Spiranthes icmadophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific ecological niches, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
