                    <h1>Sonchus glandulifera</h1>
<p>Sonchus glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it both ecologically significant and agriculturally problematic.</p>
