                    <h1>Sonchus hydrophilus</h1>
<p>Sonchus hydrophilus, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has dark green, waxy leaves that are broadly ovate and covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom during the warmer months. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
