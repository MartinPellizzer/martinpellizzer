                    <h1>Stomatium duthieae</h1>
<p>Stomatium duthieae, commonly known as the Duthie's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of northern Scotland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, facilitating photosynthesis. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Stomatium duthieae is a rare and specialized species, showcasing adaptations typical of aquatic carnivorous plants.</p>
