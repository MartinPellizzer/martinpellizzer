<p>Sempervivum glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and alpine gardens.</p>
