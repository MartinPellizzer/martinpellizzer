<p>Sorbus dualis, commonly known as the twin-fruit rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in a unique two-tiered pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock.</p>
<p>Sorbus dualis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
