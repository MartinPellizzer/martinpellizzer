                    <h1>Selaginella roraimensis var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella roraimensis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the Roraima spikemoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded environments of high-altitude rock formations, where it forms dense mats on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its role in the unique ecosystems of the tepuis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
