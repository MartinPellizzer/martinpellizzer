<p>Stemmadenia litoralis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, thick, and often hairy stems that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
