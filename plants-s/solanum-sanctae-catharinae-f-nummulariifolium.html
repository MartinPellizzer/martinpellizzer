<p>Solanum sanctae-catharinae f. nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the Solanum genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves, which are small, rounded, and densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue-black color. Native to the island of Socotra, it thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
