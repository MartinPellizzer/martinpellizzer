                <h1>Senegalia ciliolata</h1>
<p>Senegalia ciliolata, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Senegalia ciliolata is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
