<p>Stylidium curtum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sun-orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, brightly colored flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Stylidium curtum is known for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
