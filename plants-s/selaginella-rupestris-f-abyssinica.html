                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. abyssinica</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of protective cuticle, aiding in water retention. It reproduces through spores, typical of its order, and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native region.</p>
