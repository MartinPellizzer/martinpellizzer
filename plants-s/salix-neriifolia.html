<p>Salix neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and dark, glossy leaves that turn a striking red or orange in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Salix neriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
