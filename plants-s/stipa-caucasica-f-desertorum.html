<p>Stipa caucasica f. desertorum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant forms dense clumps and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet that bears small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
