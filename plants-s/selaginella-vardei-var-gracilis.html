                    <h1>Selaginella vardei var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Selaginella vardei var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
