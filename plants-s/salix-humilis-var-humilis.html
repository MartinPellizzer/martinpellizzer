                    <h1>Salix humilis var. humilis</h1>
<p>Salix humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
