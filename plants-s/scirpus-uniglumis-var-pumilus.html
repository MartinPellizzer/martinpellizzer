<p>Scirpus uniglumis var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. This variety is shorter and more compact than the typical Scirpus uniglumis, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
