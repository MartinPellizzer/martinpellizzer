                    <h1>Scyphogyne rigidula</h1>
<p>Scyphogyne rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats or anchors itself to substrates. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Scyphogyne rigidula plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
