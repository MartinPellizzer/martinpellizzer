                    <h1>Sphalmanthus micans</h1>
<p>Sphalmanthus micans, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its specialized haustoria attached to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are scale-like and often covered in fine hairs. Sphalmanthus micans typically grows along the ground, forming dense mats that can smother host vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
