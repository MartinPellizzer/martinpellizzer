<p>Specklinia dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
