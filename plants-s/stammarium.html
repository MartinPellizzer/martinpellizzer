                    <h1>Stammarium</h1>
<p>Stammarium, commonly known as the "flower of the desert," is a rare and unique plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. Stammarium is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat.</p>
