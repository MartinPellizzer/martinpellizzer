<p>Setcreasea brevifolia var. buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's shortleaf setcreasea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring season, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
