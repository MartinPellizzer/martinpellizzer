<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a dry, ribbed fruit, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
