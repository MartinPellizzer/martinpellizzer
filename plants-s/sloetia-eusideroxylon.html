<p>Sloetia eusideroxylon, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
