                    <h1>Sedum dolomiticum</h1>
<p>Sedum dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomite Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky, arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry, sunny climates.</p>
