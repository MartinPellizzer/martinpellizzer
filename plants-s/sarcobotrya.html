                    <h1>Sarcobotrya</h1>
<p>Sarcobotrya, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey, which are typically found in freshwater environments. Sarcobotrya species are often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches, where they can anchor themselves with their root systems. The leaves are usually submerged, while the flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in their ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
