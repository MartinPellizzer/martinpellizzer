                    <h1>Spergula salina var. australis</h1>
<p>Spergula salina var. australis, commonly known as the Australian saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of southern Australia and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils with high salt content. The plant typically forms low, sprawling mats with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
