                    <h1>Senegalia propinqua</h1>
<p>Senegalia propinqua, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisting branches and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that remain on the plant for an extended period.</p>
<p>Senegalia propinqua is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in desert environments.</p>
