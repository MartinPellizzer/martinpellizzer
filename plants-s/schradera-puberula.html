The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Schradera puberula is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
