                    <h1>Selinum repens</h1>
<p>Selinum repens, commonly known as creeping parsley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring and are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Selinum repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
