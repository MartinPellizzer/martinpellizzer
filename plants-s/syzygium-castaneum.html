<p>Syzygium castaneum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange to red berries containing a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
