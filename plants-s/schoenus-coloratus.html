                    <h1>Schoenus coloratus</h1>
<p>Schoenus coloratus, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Schoenus coloratus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
