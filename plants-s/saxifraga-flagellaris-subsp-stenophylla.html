<p>Saxifraga flagellaris subsp.</p>
<p>stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lanceolate leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and specialized adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
