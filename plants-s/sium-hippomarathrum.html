<p>Sium hippomarathrum, commonly known as the marsh hogweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, clay-rich soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
