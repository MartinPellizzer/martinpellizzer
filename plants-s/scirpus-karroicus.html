<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with purple, especially at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
