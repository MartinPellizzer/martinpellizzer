                    <h1>Sclerophylax caducifructus</h1>
<p>Sclerophylax caducifructus, commonly known as the brittle-fruited sclerophyll, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, brittle fruits that split open to release seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Sclerophylax caducifructus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert flora and fauna.</p>
