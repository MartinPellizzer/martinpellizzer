                    <h1>Sandwithia heterocalyx</h1>
<p>Sandwithia heterocalyx, commonly known as the desert sandthistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Sandwithia heterocalyx plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
