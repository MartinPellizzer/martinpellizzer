<p>Sarcathria strobilacea, commonly known as the clustered spike moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks called strobila, which give it its species name.</p>
<p>Sarcathria strobilacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
