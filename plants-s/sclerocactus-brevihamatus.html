                    <h1>Sclerocactus brevihamatus</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus brevihamatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sclerocactus brevihamatus is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
