                    <h1>Salsola rigida</h1>
<p>Salsola rigida, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Salsola rigida is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
