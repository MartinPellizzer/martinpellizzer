                    <h1>Sorindeia obtusifoliolata var. parvifoliolata</h1>
<p>Sorindeia obtusifoliolata var. parvifoliolata, commonly known as the small-leaved sorindeia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
