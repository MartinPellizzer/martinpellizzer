<p>Salvia cuspidata subsp.</p>
<p>bangii, commonly known as Bang's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of oppositely arranged leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer and more pointed calyces compared to the typical form of S. cuspidata.</p>
