<p>Silene rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in regions like Turkey and Cyprus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene rechingeri is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat destruction and limited distribution.</p>
