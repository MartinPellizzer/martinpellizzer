<p>Scleria setigera, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Scleria setigera thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the ecological stability of wetland habitats.</p>
