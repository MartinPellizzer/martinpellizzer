                    <h1>Stelanthes</h1>
<p>Stelanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Stelanthes is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
