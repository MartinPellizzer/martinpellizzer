                    <h1>Sulcorebutia mariana var. prantneri</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia mariana var. prantneri, commonly known as the Prantner's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, rounded stem that often displays a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple, due to its high concentration of pigments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its vibrant stem. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
