<p>Smilax nervomarginata, commonly known as the veined smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem covered in sharp, recurved spines, which help it to climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive veining pattern along the margins.</p>
<p>Smilax nervomarginata is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
