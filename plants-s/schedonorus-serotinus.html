<p>Schedonorus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, dark green blades.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Schedonorus serotinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, uniform appearance.</p>
