                    <h1>Spergula salina var. leiosperma</h1>
<p>Spergula salina var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation communities.</p>
