<p>Salsola grandis, commonly known as desert spinach, is a halophytic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, spinach-like flavor.</p>
<p>Salsola grandis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
