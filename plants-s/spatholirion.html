<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in shades of pink or white. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Spatholirion species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
