<p>Java sida, scientifically known as Sida javensis subsp. expilosa, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad leaves. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Java sida is not only ecologically significant but also has traditional uses in local medicine and as a forage plant. Its unique features make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
