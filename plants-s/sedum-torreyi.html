<p>Sedum torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates.</p>
