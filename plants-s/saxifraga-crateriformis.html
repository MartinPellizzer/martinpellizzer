<p>Saxifraga crateriformis, commonly known as the crater-form saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
