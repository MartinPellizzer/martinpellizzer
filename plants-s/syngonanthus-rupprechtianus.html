<p>Syngonanthus rupprechtianus, commonly known as the Rupprecht's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as both a parasite and a food source for various wildlife species.</p>
