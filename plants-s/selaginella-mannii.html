<p>Selaginella mannii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving a free-living gametophyte stage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around a central axis, with sporangia borne on short stalks.</p>
<p>Selaginella mannii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its desiccation tolerance, a trait linked to its production of protective compounds.</p>
