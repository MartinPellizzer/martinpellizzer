<p>Saxifraga stricta, commonly known as the upright saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pinkish, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Saxifraga stricta is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, contributing to the unique flora of these ecosystems.</p>
