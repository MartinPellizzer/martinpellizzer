                    <h1>Spergula subulata</h1>
<p>Spergula subulata, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on dry, rocky soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh conditions, and it is often found in alpine or arctic regions.</p>
<p>Spergula subulata is an important component of certain ecological communities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
