                    <h1>Stuckenia</h1>
<p>Stuckenia, commonly known as water plantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>These aquatic or semi-aquatic plants are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves that often float on the water surface or grow submerged. They typically produce small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Stuckenia species are found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions.</p>
<p>Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and form dense vegetation, which can play a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
