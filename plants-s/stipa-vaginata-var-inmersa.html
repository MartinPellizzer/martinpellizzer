<p>Stipa vaginata var. inmersa, commonly known as the submerged false oat, is a grass species characterized by its unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it forms dense, herbaceous clumps. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small florets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
