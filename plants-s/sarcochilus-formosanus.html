<p>Sarcochilus formosanus, commonly known as the Formosa orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with bright yellow petals and a distinctive red lip. It is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
