                            <h1>Satureja Nummulariifolia</h1>
<p>Roundleaf sage, scientifically known as Satureja nummulariifolia, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. This aromatic herb is characterized by its small, round leaves and compact growth habit, making it a unique addition to any garden or natural landscape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Despite its modest size, Roundleaf sage has been valued for its culinary and medicinal properties throughout history. Its conservation status highlights the importance of protecting this endangered species from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
