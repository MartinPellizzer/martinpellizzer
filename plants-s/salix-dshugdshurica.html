<p>Salix dshugdshurica, commonly known as the Dshugdshur willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
