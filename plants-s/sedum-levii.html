<p>Sedum levii, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Sedum levii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
