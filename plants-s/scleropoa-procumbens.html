<p>Scleropoa procumbens, commonly known as the creeping glassworts, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its adaptations to drought stress include deep root systems and the ability to enter dormancy during extended dry periods.</p>
<p>Scleropoa procumbens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert ecosystems.</p>
