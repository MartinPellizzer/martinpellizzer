                    <h1>Serpocaulon vacillans</h1>
<p>Serpocaulon vacillans, commonly known as the wavering serpentine, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble the movement of a serpent, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky crevices or on the edges of waterfalls. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are small and clustered at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serpocaulon vacillans is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
