                    <h1>Strophanthus gerrardii</h1>
<p>Strophanthus gerrardii, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves contain cardioactive alkaloids, making it historically significant in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation without proper expertise.</p>
