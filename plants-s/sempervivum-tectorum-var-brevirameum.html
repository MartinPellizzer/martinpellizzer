                    <h1>Sempervivum tectorum var. brevirameum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum tectorum var. brevirameum, commonly known as the "Hens and Chicks," is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light exposure. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>This variety is also known for its ability to bloom with pink or purple flowers in the summer months.</p>
