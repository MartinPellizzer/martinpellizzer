                    <h1>Senecio pseudaspericaulis</h1>
<p>Senecio pseudaspericaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
