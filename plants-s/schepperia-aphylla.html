                    <h1>Schepperia aphylla</h1>
<p>Schepperia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. It produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to its leafless form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unusual morphology makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a prized addition to specialized orchid collections.</p>
