                    <h1>Sabouraea</h1>
<p>Sabouraea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Sabouraea species are typically drought-tolerant and have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Their leaves are often small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
