                    <h1>Selaginella compta</h1>
<p>Selaginella compta, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dichotomous branching pattern, with leaves arranged in two opposite rows along its stems. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Selaginella compta is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues.</p>
