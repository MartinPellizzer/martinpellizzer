                    <h1>Stipa atacamensis</h1>
<p>Stipa atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
