<p>Seidelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf seidelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats to protect itself from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Seidelia pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems.</p>
