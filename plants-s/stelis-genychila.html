<p>Stelis genychila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Stelis genychila is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
