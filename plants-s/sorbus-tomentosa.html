                    <h1>Sorbus tomentosa</h1>
<p>Sorbus tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly-gray pubescence on young stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Sorbus tomentosa is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and scrublands, and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
