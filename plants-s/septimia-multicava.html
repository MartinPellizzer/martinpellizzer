                    <h1>Septimia multicava</h1>
<p>Septimia multicava, commonly known as the hollow stem plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, hollow stems that are often segmented and ribbed.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Septimia multicava is notable for its ability to store water in its stem, making it resilient to periods of drought.</p>
