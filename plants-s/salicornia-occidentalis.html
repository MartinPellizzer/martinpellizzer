                    <h1>Salicornia occidentalis</h1>
<p>Salicornia occidentalis, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often red or pink in color, which help it store water and tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by tiny, bead-like seeds. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, minimizing water loss in arid or salty conditions.</p>
<p>Salicornia occidentalis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
