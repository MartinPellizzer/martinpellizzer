                <h1>Selliguea moulmeinensis</h1>
<p>Selliguea moulmeinensis, commonly known as the Moulmein liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, leaf-like body that is covered in microscopic pores, which aid in gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including antheridia and archegonia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Selliguea moulmeinensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of humid microhabitats.</p>
