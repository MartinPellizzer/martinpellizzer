<p>Smilax nana, commonly known as dwarf greenbriar, is a low-growing perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are covered in sharp, recurved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Smilax nana is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets.</p>
