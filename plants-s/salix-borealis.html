                    <h1>Salix borealis</h1>
<p>Salix borealis, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is one of the few willow species that grows in permanently frozen ground, adapting to extreme cold and short growing seasons. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its root system helps stabilize permafrost and prevent erosion in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Salix borealis plays a vital role in the ecology of polar ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
