                    <h1>Selaginella paradoxa</h1>
<p>Selaginella paradoxa, commonly known as the "Reverse Spike Moss," is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when conditions become unfavorable. The plant features a creeping, branched stem system with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves, making it a fascinating example of spore-producing plant adaptation.</p>
