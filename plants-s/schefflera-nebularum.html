<p>Schefflera nebularum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
