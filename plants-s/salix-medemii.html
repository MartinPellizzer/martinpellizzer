<p>Salix medemii, commonly known as the Medem willow, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme conditions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Salix medemii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
