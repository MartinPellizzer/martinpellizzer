                    <h1>Staurogyne carvalhoi</h1>
<p>Staurogyne carvalhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian waterweed, is a aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often borne in clusters near the water's surface. Staurogyne carvalhoi thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic habitat provider and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
