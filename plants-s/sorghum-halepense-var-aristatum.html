                    <h1>Sorghum halepense var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Sorghum halepense var. aristatum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-green plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and the inflorescence consists of a tall, branched cluster of flowering spikes.</p>
