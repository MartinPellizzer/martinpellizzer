<p>Serrafalcus patulus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multi-flowered cliff fern, is a striking plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique varietal trait, multiflorus, refers to the presence of multiple flower-like structures along its fronds, which are actually modified leaves.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
