<p>Stichorkis araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and often pale in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stichorkis araneola is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
