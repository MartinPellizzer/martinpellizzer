<p>Sedum palmeri subsp.</p>
<p>emarginatum, commonly known as the Palmer's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal irrigation.</p>
