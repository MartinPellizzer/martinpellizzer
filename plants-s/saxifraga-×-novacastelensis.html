                    <h1>Saxifraga × novacastelensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × novacastelensis, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a compact cyme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural wild environment.</p>
