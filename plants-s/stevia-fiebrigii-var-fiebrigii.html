                    <h1>Stevia fiebrigii var. fiebrigii</h1>
<p>Stevia fiebrigii var. fiebrigii, commonly known as the "sweetleaf" or "stevia," is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Stevia fiebrigii var. fiebrigii is widely cultivated for its sweetening properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.</p>
