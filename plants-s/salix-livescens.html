                    <h1>Salix livescens</h1>
<p>Salix livescens, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix livescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat.</p>
