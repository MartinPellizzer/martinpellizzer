<p>Spiesia pagobia, commonly known as the Pacific sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and tidal flats, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Spiesia pagobia plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
