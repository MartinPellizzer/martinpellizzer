<p>Statice paui, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Statice paui is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements and as a cut flower.</p>
