                    <h1>Schoenorchis densiflora var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Schoenorchis densiflora var. abbreviata, commonly known as the compact orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
