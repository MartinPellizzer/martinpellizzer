                    <h1>Sanicula tienmuensis var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Sanicula tienmuensis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sanicula, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, contributing to its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
