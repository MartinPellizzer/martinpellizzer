<p>Scirpus alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>oliganthus, commonly known as the alpine club-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous tundra environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
