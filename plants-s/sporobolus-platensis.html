<p>Sporobolus platensis, commonly known as the flatleaf spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Sporobolus platensis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
