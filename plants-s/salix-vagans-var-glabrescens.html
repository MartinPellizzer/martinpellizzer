                    <h1>Salix vagans var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Salix vagans var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, pendulous branches that give it a weeping appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glossy surface, which distinguishes it from other willow species. It produces catkins in early spring, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
