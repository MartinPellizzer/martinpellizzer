<p>Saxifraga angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous environments where the climate is cold and the growing season is short. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, producing white or pinkish petals that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga angustata is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.</p>
