<p>Stryphnodendron racemiferum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
