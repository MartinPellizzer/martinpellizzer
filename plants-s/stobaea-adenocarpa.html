                    <h1>Stobaea adenocarpa</h1>
<p>Stobaea adenocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Stobaea adenocarpa is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
