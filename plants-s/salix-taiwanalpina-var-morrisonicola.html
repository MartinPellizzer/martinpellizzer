                    <h1>Salix taiwanalpina var. morrisonicola</h1>
<p>Salix taiwanalpina var. morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
