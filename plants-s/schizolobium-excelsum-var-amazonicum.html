                    <h1>Schizolobium excelsum var. amazonicum</h1>
<p>Schizolobium excelsum var. amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and strength, making it an important resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
