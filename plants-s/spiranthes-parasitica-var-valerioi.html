                    <h1>Spiranthes parasitica var. valerioi</h1>
<p>Spiranthes parasitica var. valerioi, commonly known as the Valerio's Ladies' Tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. This variety is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
