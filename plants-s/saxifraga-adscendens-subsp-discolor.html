<p>Saxifraga adscendens subsp.</p>
<p>discolor, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats of foliage.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its white-variegated leaves, which feature a striking contrast of green and white markings. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and often display a pale pink to white color.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other species can survive.</p>
