<p>Sagina fontinalis, commonly known as water pearlwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features tiny, rounded leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky crevices, stream banks, and wet meadows across temperate regions.</p>
<p>Sagina fontinalis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
