<p>Stelis nigriflora, commonly known as the black-flowered stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for nutrients and moisture. Its most distinctive feature is its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant produces small, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Stelis nigriflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
