                    <h1>Selaginella volkensii</h1>
<p>Selaginella volkensii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of linear, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores, a characteristic feature of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
