                    <h1>Stelis triplaris</h1>
<p>Stelis triplaris, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Stelis triplaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
