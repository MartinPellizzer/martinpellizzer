<p>Saxifraga mutata subsp.</p>
<p>demissa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
