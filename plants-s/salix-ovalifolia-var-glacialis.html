                    <h1>Salix ovalifolia var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Salix ovalifolia var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before its leaves emerge, which is an adaptation to take advantage of early-season pollinators. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
