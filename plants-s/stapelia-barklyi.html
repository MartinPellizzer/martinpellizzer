                    <h1>Stapelia barklyi</h1>
<p>Stapelia barklyi, commonly known as the Barkley's Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia barklyi is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
