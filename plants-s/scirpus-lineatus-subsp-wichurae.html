<p>Scirpus lineatus subsp.</p>
<p>wichurae, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, covered with fine, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color, which develop into dry, winged seeds. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of marsh and pond ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health.</p>
