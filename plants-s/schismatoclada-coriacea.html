<p>Schismatoclada coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a rough, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Schismatoclada coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
