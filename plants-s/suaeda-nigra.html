<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in saline soils and is adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or barren areas.</p>
