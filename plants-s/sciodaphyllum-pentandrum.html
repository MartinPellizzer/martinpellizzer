                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum pentandrum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum pentandrum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Doryopteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spore-producing organs arranged in a specific pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum pentandrum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
