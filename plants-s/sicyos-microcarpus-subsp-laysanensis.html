<p>Sicyos microcarpus subsp.</p>
<p>laysanensis, commonly known as the Laysan bottle-gourd, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Hawaiian island of Laysan. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its slender stems and small, pale green, heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are followed by distinctive bottle-shaped fruits. It thrives in coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its isolated island home.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
