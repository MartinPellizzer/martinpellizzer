<p>Sedum malacophyllum, commonly known as the silver sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
