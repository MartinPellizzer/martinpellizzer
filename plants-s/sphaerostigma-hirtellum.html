<p>Sphaerostigma hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy ball moss, is a type of epiphytic liverwort that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dense, cushion-like growth form with small, overlapping leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces capsules for spore dispersal, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
