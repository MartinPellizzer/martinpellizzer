                    <h1>Sagina maritima var. debilis</h1>
<p>Sagina maritima var. debilis, commonly known as the slender beachweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh coastal environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
