                    <h1>Schlegelia parasitica</h1>
<p>Schlegelia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often causing stress or even death to the host tree if the infestation is severe.</p>
<p>Schlegelia parasitica is native to Australia and is considered an ecological indicator of certain forest ecosystems.</p>
