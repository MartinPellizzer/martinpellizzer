                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. schmidtii</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized member of the spikemoss family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It is characterized by its ability to retain moisture in dry conditions, which is an adaptation to its often harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
