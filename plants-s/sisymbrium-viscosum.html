                    <h1>Sisymbrium viscosum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium viscosum, commonly known as sticky shepherd's purse, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular seed pods that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium viscosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
