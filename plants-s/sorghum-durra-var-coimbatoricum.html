                    <h1>Sorghum durra var. coimbatoricum</h1>
<p>Sorghum durra var. coimbatoricum, commonly known as Coimbatoric sorghum, is a lesser-known variant of the sorghum genus native to specific regions of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust stalks and small, clustered inflorescences, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds are used for both human consumption and animal feed, though it is less commonly cultivated than other sorghum varieties.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential role in sustainable agriculture.</p>
