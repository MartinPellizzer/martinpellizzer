<p>Sciaphila trichopoda, commonly known as the hairy sunshade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Sciaphila trichopoda thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is listed as endangered in several regions.</p>
