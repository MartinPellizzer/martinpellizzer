                    <h1>Streblosa deliensis</h1>
<p>Streblosa deliensis, commonly known as the Delinean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Streblosa deliensis is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, forested environments.</p>
