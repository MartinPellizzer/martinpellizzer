<p>Sambucus arborescens, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and has palmately lobed leaves with a serrated edge. Its berries are toxic when unripe but become edible once fully mature, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Sambucus arborescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
