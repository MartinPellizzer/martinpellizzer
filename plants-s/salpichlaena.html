                    <h1>Salpichlaena</h1>
<p>Salpichlaena, commonly known as the walking fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique ability to "walk" by growing new shoots from the tips of their rhizomes, allowing them to spread across surfaces. Salpichlaena species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. They have trifoliate leaves with three leaflets, and their flowers are small and clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
