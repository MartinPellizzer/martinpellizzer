                    <h1>Stigmatopteris ecuadorensis</h1>
<p>Stigmatopteris ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian stigmatopteris, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread in moist, shaded environments. Its sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in a unique linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution.</p>
