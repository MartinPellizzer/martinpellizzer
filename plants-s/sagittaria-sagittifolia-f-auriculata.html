<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia f. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often broader and more rounded than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>It is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to improve water quality.</p>
