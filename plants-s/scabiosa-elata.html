<p>Scabiosa elata, commonly known as the skyrocket scabiosa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Scabiosa elata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
