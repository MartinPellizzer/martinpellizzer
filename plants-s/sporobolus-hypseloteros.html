<p>Sporobolus hypseloteros, commonly known as the tall sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the Great Plains and western regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus hypseloteros is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
