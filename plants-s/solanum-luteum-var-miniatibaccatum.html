<p>Solanum luteum var. miniatibaccatum, commonly known as the miniature yellow nightshade, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow-orange berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, which are characteristic of the Solanaceae family. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowering stems are often branched. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, like other members of the nightshade family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
