<p>Stelis vulcani, commonly known as the Vulcan's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis vulcani is often found in humid, shaded environments such as mountain forests.</p>
