                    <h1>Salvia hispanica var. chionocalyx</h1>
<p>Salvia hispanica var. chionocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered chia plant, is a variant of the chia species native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and fiber. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and culinary use.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical black-seeded chia but is valued for its unique floral display and nutritional benefits.</p>
