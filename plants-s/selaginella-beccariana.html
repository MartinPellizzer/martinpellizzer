                    <h1>Selaginella beccariana</h1>
<p>Selaginella beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. The plant features closely packed, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Selaginella beccariana is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
