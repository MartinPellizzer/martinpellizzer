                <h1>Saxifraga aquatica</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aquatica, commonly known as water saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
