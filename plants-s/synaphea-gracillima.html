                    <h1>Synaphea gracillima</h1>
<p>Synaphea gracillima, commonly known as the slender synaphea, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, epiphytic ferns that typically grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Synaphea gracillima is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
