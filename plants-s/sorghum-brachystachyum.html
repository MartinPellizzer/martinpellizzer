                    <h1>Sorghum brachystachyum</h1>
<p>Sorghum brachystachyum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stiff stalks, which make it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sorghum brachystachyum is also valued for its use in traditional crafts and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
