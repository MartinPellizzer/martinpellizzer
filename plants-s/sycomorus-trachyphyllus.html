<p>Sycomorus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a nut-like seed. The fruit's outer husk is fibrous and separates from the hard, oily kernel inside.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its economic importance, particularly for the production of shea butter from its seeds.</p>
