<p>Stenophyllus capillaris var. longinux, commonly known as the long-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, elongated inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, panicle-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted for wind pollination, with lightweight seeds that disperse easily.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
