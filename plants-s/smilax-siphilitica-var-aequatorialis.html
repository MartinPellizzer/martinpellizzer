                    <h1>Smilax siphilitica var. aequatorialis</h1>
<p>Smilax siphilitica var. aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian smilax, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a robust, woody stem with thorn-covered stems and leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its berries are dark red to black when mature and are an important food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of S. siphilitica.</p>
