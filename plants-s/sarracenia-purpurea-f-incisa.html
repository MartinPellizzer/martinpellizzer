                    <h1>Sarracenia purpurea f. incisa</h1>
<p>Sarracenia purpurea f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form tubular traps with a distinctive red coloration and a darker central stripe. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its pitcher-shaped leaves, where they are digested by digestive enzymes. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and requires high humidity and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which differs from the more common S. purpurea var. purpurea.</p>
