                    <h1>Stratiotes aculeatus</h1>
<p>Stratiotes aculeatus, commonly known as spiny water frog or water spurge, is a floating aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in small, sharp spines, which help deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its spiny structure and buoyant leaves make it well adapted to life on the water's surface.</p>
