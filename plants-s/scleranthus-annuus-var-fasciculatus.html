                    <h1>Scleranthus annuus var. fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Scleranthus annuus var. fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered common cocklebur, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, giving it its varietal name "fasciculatus.". It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiky capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing.</p>
