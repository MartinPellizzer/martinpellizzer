<p>Stigmarota jangomas, commonly known as the Jangoma fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often recurved and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Stigmarota jangomas is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
