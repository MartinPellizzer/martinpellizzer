                    <h1>Shorea collaris</h1>
<p>Shorea collaris, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dark, heavy timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense forests in brackish or saline water environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Shorea collaris plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
