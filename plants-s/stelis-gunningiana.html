<p>Stelis gunningiana, commonly known as the Gunning's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis gunningiana is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest canopies.</p>
