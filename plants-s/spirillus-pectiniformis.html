                    <h1>Spirillus pectiniformis</h1>
<p>Spirillus pectiniformis, commonly known as the spiral alga, is a unique freshwater algae characterized by its spiral-shaped thallus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Cyanobacteria, which are photosynthetic prokaryotes capable of performing nitrogen fixation. The plant's structure consists of a single, coiled filament that can reach lengths of several centimeters. Spirillus pectiniformis thrives in nutrient-rich, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its spiral morphology is an adaptation that may aid in light absorption and nutrient uptake.</p>
