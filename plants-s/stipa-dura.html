<p>Stipa dura, commonly known as hardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and坚韧的 (resilient) culms that can withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Stipa dura is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous structure and hardiness make it valuable for erosion control and as a forage plant in certain regions.</p>
