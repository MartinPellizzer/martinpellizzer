<p>Salix opsimantha var. opsimantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, silvery or whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones.</p>
