<p>Scleria leptocladia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. Native to parts of Africa, this plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated.</p>
