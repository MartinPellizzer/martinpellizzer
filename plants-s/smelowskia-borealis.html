                    <h1>Smelowskia borealis</h1>
<p>Smelowskia borealis, commonly known as the northern smelowskia, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and features small, silver-gray leaves that reflect the harsh sunlight. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom during the brief summer season. Its root system is adapted to survive in permafrost conditions, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Smelowskia borealis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
