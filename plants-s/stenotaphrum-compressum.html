<p>Stenotaphrum compressum, commonly known as common devil's grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Stenotaphrum compressum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
