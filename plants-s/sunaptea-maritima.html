                    <h1>Sunaptea maritima</h1>
<p>Sunaptea maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is well adapted to maritime conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Sunaptea maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
