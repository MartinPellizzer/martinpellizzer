                    <h1>Sporobolus ghikae</h1>
<p>Sporobolus ghikae, commonly known as desert dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Sporobolus ghikae is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
