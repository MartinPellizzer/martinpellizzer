                    <h1>Selinum tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Selinum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to the dry, rocky soils of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels, a characteristic common among plants in the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly consumed than its relative, parsley.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
