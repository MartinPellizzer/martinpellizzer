                <h1>Struthiopteris sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris sessilifolia, commonly known as the barren woodsorrel, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are directly attached to the stem.</p>
