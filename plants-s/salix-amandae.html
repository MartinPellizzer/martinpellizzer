                    <h1>Salix amandae</h1>
<p>Salix amandae, commonly known as the Andean willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salix amandae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
