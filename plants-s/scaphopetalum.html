<p>Scaphopetalum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects.
