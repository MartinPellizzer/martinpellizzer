                    <h1>Simocheilus subrigidus</h1>
<p>Simocheilus subrigidus, commonly known as the rigid swamp orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinct, spurred lip. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
