                    <h1>Sphaeromorphaea littoralis</h1>
<p>Sphaeromorphaea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts. These bladders help the plant float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant is often found in shallow, still waters near the coast.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
