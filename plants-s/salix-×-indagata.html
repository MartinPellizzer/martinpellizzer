<p>Salix × indagata, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Salix × indagata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, often disturbed soils.</p>
