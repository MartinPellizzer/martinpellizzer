<p>Smilax discotis subsp.</p>
<p>concolor, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed arrowhead, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both a valuable ecological component and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
