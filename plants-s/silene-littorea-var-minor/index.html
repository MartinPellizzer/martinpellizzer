                            <h1>Silene Littorea Var. Minor</h1>
<p>Silene littorea var. minor is a lesser-known variant of the coastal bladder campion, thriving in the damp, rocky environments of coastal regions. This plant is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand harsh maritime conditions. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the coastal ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique plant from the threats of coastal erosion and human disturbance.</p>
