<p>Sisymbrium vernale, commonly known as yellow rocket, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are small, dry, and contain a hard coat, which aids in their dispersal.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium vernale is often considered a weed but can also serve as a source of nectar for pollinators.</p>
