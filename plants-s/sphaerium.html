                    <h1>Sphaerium</h1>
<p>Sphaerium, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. Sphaerium species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant's morphology includes delicate, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both predators and prey.</p>
