<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
