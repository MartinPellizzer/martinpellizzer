                    <h1>Stictocardia macalusoi</h1>
<p>Stictocardia macalusoi, commonly known as the Macaluso's lichen, is a unique and rare lichen species belonging to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It is primarily found in regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research on lichen ecology and conservation.</p>
