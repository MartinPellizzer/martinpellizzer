                    <h1>Stenotaphrum micranthum</h1>
<p>Stenotaphrum micranthum, commonly known as common carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of Florida.</p>
<p>It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, three-angled seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.</p>
