                    <h1>Stemonurus evenius</h1>
<p>Stemonurus evenius, commonly known as the silverleaf stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
