                    <h1>Saxifraga × finnisae</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × finnisae, commonly known as the Finn's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant species native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in peat bogs and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
