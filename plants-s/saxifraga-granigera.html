                    <h1>Saxifraga granigera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga granigera, commonly known as the granulate saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Saxifraga granigera is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to add color to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
