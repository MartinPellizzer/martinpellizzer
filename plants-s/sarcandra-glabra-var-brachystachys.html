                    <h1>Sarcandra glabra var. brachystachys</h1>
<p>Sarcandra glabra var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked sarcandra, is a rare variant of the sarcandra plant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
