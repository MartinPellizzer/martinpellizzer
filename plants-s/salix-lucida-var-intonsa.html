<p>Salix lucida var. intonsa, commonly known as the white willow.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common white willow (Salix alba) but is distinguished by its unique growth habit and foliage.</p>
