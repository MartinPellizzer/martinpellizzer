<p>Selaginella expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces spores in specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella expansa is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
