<p>Sabal etonia, commonly known as the Etonia sago palm, is a species native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Its trunk is segmented and covered with a fibrous, sago-like material, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Sabal etonia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
