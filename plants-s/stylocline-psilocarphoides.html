                    <h1>Stylocline psilocarphoides</h1>
<p>Stylocline psilocarphoides, commonly known as the slender psilocarphoid, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species.</p>
