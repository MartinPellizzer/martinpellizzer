<p>Solanum boliviense subsp.</p>
<p>astleyi, commonly known as the Bolivian nightshade, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, pubescent leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in wild, undisturbed habitats rather than in cultivation.</p>
