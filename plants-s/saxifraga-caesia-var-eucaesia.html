                    <h1>Saxifraga caesia var. eucaesia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga caesia var. eucaesia, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy purple or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in poor, rocky soils and is well adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>This species is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
