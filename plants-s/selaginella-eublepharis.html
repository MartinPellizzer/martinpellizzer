<p>Selaginella eublepharis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, forming a dense, moss-like appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella eublepharis reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
