<p>Stelis decurrens, commonly known as the cascading orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that often hang in cascading clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Stelis decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
