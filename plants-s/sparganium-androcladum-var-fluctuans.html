                    <h1>Sparganium androcladum var. fluctuans</h1>
<p>Sparganium androcladum var. fluctuans, commonly known as the floating bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed genus native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to float on the water surface, with its inflated, bladder-like stems that aid in buoyancy. The plant produces spiky, cone-like structures called burrs, which are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental features. Its growth is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels, which is reflected in its common name.</p>
