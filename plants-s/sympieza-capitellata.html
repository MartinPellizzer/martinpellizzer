<p>Sympieza capitellata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host trees, primarily species of the genus *Acacia*, through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sympieza capitellata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also competing with its host for nutrients.</p>
