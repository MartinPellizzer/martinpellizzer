                    <h1>Sorbus persica var. acutilobata</h1>
<p>Sorbus persica var. acutilobata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
