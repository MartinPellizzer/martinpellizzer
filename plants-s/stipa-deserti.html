                    <h1>Stipa deserti</h1>
<p>Stipa deserti, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. Stipa deserti typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone areas makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
