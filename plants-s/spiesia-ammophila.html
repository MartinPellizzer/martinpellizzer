<p>Spiesia ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Spiesia ammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
