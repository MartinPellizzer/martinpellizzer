                    <h1>Saxifraga vayredana var. major</h1>
<p>Saxifraga vayredana var. major, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold and arid climates.</p>
