                    <h1>Swartzia arumateuana</h1>
<p>Swartzia arumateuana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat.</p>
