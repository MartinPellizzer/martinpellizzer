<p>Selaginella willdenowii, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce upright, spore-bearing cones at the tips. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Selaginella willdenowii is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells.</p>
