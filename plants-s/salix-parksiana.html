<p>Salix parksiana, commonly known as the Park's willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones along streams and rivers.</p>
<p>Salix parksiana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
