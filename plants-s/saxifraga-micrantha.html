                    <h1>Saxifraga micrantha</h1>
<p>Saxifraga micrantha, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, aiding in survival at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Saxifraga micrantha is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
