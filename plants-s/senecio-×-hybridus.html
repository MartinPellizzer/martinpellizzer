                    <h1>Senecio × hybridus</h1>
<p>Senecio × hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Senecio auricula and Senecio cineraria.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is popular among gardeners in regions with mild winters.</p>
