<p>Schmidiella maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, translucent petals and sepals that resemble a spectral figure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between June and August. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, moist environments, often among leaf litter or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Schmidiella maxwellii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
