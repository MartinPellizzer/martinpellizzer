<p>Specklinia fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Specklinia fractiflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
