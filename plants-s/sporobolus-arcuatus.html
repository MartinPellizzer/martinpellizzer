<p>Sporobolus arcuatus, commonly known as the bentgrass or silky grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, blue-green foliage that often forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Sporobolus arcuatus is valued for its erosion control capabilities and its use in restoration ecology.</p>
