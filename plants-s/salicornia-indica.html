                    <h1>Salicornia indica</h1>
<p>Salicornia indica, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it is an annual species that completes its life cycle within a single growing season. Salicornia indica is adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
