                    <h1>Selaginella pumila var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella pumila var. ramosa, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, low-growing fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, thread-like stems that branch out into clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more branched growth pattern compared to the typical form of S. pumila.</p>
