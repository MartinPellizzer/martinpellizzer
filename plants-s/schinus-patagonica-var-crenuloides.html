                    <h1>Schinus patagonica var. crenuloides</h1>
<p>Schinus patagonica var. crenuloides, commonly known as the Patagonian pepper or crenulate poisonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution.</p>
