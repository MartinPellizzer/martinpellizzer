<p>Salix caprina, commonly known as the goat willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as riverbanks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Salix caprina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
