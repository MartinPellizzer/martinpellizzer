                    <h1>Sphedamnocarpus</h1>
<p>Sphedamnocarpus, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dark, almost black, upper surface that is covered in a layer of tiny, raised bumps called pseudocortex. The lower surface is usually lighter in color and features a network of fine, leaf-like structures called rhizines. This lichen is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
