                    <h1>Sporobolus scabridus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus scabridus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in dry, sandy soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained environments, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Its ability to spread through rhizomes allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Sporobolus scabridus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
