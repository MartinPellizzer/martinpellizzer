<p>Salix brachycarpa subsp.</p>
<p>niphoclada, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing mountainous soils and its potential for use in reforestation projects in harsh climates.</p>
