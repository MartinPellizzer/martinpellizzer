                    <h1>Salix coerulangrenica</h1>
<p>Salix coerulangrenica, commonly known as the Azure-veined Willow, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a striking azure-blue vein pattern, which distinguishes it from other willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
