                    <h1>Strombocactus turbiniformis var. seidelii</h1>
<p>Strombocactus turbiniformis var. seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's Turbinated Cactus, is a compact, rounded cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure.</p>
<p>It features short, spiny ribs that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
