                    <h1>Sorbus sambucifolia var. pumila</h1>
<p>Sorbus sambucifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeams, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
