                    <h1>Salix daiseniensis f. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Salix daiseniensis f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf willow, is a unique form of the Daiseniensis willow, characterized by its distinctive round or oval-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This shrub is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species, giving the plant a compact appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its pollination process.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features.</p>
