                    <h1>Saxifraga primulifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga primulifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>Saxifraga primulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in difficult growing conditions.</p>
