<p>Salix nasarovii, commonly known as the Pamir willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
