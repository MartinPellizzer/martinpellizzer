                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos batulantensis</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos batulantensis, commonly known as the glittering starblossom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silver-green foliage that reflects light, enhancing its ethereal appearance. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar eclipse, a phenomenon linked to its unique phototropic responses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
