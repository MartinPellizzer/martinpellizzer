                    <h1>Scirpus pungens var. polyphyllus</h1>
<p>Scirpus pungens var. polyphyllus, commonly known as the purple stem bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that often display a striking purple hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife.</p>
