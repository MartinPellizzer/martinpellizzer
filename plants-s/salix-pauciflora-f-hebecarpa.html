                    <h1>Salix pauciflora f. hebecarpa</h1>
<p>Salix pauciflora f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit willow, is a rare and unique variant of the willow family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's most distinguishing feature is its elongated, narrow fruits, which differ from the typical spherical fruits of the species. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
