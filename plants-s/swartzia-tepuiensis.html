                    <h1>Swartzia tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Swartzia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui swartzia, is a rare and endemic tree species found in the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the unique ecological conditions of the tepui landscapes. Its morphology includes a straight trunk and compound leaves, with small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale in color.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Swartzia tepuiensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
