<p>Simaba pohliana, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by edible, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
