                    <h1>Schizoglossum restioides</h1>
<p>Schizoglossum restioides, commonly known as the rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small, four-petaled, and usually pale yellow or white.</p>
<p>Schizoglossum restioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
