                    <h1>Spartina densiflora</h1>
<p>Spartina densiflora, commonly known as coastal cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This plant thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Spartina densiflora produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing lightweight seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of tidal marsh ecosystems.</p>
