<p>Schizocarpum attenuatum, commonly known as the slender schizocarp, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dry, multi-seeded fruits called schizocarps. These fruits split into two parts when mature, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Schizocarpum attenuatum is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential.</p>
