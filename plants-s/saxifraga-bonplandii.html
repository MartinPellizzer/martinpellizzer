<p>Saxifraga bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in high-altitude regions, where it adapts to cold temperatures and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bonplandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
