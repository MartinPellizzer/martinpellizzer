<p>Streptocarpus lilliputana, commonly known as the miniature streptocarpus, is a small, flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of purple and white, often with a distinctive pattern of spots or stripes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Streptocarpus lilliputana is popular among collectors due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
