                    <h1>Sclerocactus havasupaiensis</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus havasupaiensis, commonly known as the Havasupai cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are often pollinated by bees and other insects. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for continued protection and study.</p>
