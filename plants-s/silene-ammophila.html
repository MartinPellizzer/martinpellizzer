<p>Silene ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy soils, often found on dunes and coastal cliffs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Silene ammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
