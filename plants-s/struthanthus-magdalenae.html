<p>Struthanthus magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with features such as succulent stems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
