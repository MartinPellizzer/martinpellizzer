                    <h1>Sphinga acatlensis</h1>
<p>Sphinga acatlensis, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Sphinga acatlensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
