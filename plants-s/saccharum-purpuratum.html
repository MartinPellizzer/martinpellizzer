                    <h1>Saccharum purpuratum</h1>
<p>Saccharum purpuratum, commonly known as purple cane grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple or reddish hues in its foliage and inflorescence, which make it visually distinctive. The plant produces long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are clustered in panicles and are typically small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated for sugar production as Saccharum officinarum, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
