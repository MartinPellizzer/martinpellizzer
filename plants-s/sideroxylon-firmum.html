                    <h1>Sideroxylon firmum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon firmum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Sideroxylon firmum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
