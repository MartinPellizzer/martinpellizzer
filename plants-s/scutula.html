                    <h1>Scutula</h1>
<p>Scutula, commonly known as the shield fern, is a member of the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Scutula is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in botanical gardens.</p>
