<p>Sarcochilus longmanii, commonly known as the Longman's sarcochilus, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure, with broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific conditions to successfully propagate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
