<p>Setilobus boae-vistae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, rounded berry that turns red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
