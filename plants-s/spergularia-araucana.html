<p>Spergularia araucana, commonly known as the Chilean sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Spergularia araucana plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
