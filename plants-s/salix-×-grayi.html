<p>Salix × grayi, commonly known as the gray willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, which are essential for wind pollination. It thrives in moist soils, often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Salix × grayi is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
