                    <h1>Sedum rupestre f. reflexum</h1>
<p>Sedum rupestre f. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
