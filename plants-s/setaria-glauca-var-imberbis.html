                    <h1>Setaria glauca var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Setaria glauca var. imberbis, commonly known as slender bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>The variety imberbis is distinguished by its reduced or absent bristles on the lemma, setting it apart from other varieties of Setaria glauca.</p>
