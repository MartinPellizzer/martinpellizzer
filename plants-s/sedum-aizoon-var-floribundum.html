                    <h1>Sedum aizoon var. floribundum</h1>
<p>Sedum aizoon var. floribundum, commonly known as the flowering stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
