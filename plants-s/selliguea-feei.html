                    <h1>Selliguea feei</h1>
<p>Selliguea feei, commonly known as the dwarf rock moss, is a small, low-growing fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping fronds that form dense mats on rocky surfaces or soil. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Selliguea feei is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
