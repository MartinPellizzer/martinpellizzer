                    <h1>Spergularia fimbriata var. interclusa</h1>
<p>Spergularia fimbriata var. interclusa, commonly known as the clustered sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed sandy habitats.</p>
