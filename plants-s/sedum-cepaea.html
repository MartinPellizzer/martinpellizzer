<p>Sedum cepaea, commonly known as the "buttercup sedum," is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern, with leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum cepaea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
