<p>Silene esquamata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Silene esquamata is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny environments with minimal water availability.</p>
