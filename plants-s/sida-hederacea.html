                    <h1>Sida hederacea</h1>
<p>Sida hederacea, commonly known as broadleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Sida hederacea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
