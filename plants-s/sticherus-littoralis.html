<p>Sticherus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sticherus, is a small, flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of tidal pools and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it a hardy species in brackish environments.</p>
<p>Sticherus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
