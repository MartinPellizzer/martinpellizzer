<p>Sclerochiton nitidus, commonly known as the glossy spurge, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often followed by orange or red berries. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
