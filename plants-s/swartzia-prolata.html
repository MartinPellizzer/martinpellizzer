                    <h1>Swartzia prolata</h1>
<p>Swartzia prolata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-gray bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Swartzia prolata is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in the crafting of musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
