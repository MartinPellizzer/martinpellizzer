                    <h1>Sideroxylon calcareum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon calcareum, commonly known as the limestone wood or rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon calcareum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature in xerophytic landscapes.</p>
