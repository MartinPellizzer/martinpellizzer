                    <h1>Scirpus coahuilensis</h1>
<p>Scirpus coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of saline lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Scirpus coahuilensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the structure and function of wetland ecosystems.</p>
