<p>Stalagmitis guineensis, commonly known as the West African climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of West Africa.</p>

The plant has large, broad, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikes, and it produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction.</p>
<p>Stalagmitis guineensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforest canopies.</p>
