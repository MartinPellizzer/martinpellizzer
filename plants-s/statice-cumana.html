<p>Statice cumana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Statice cumana is also widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and long-lasting blooms.</p>
