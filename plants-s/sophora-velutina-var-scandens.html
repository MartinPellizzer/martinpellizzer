                    <h1>Sophora velutina var. scandens</h1>
<p>Sophora velutina var. scandens, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a climbing legume native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, flexible stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, green, bean-like pods that contain flattened, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing along fences or trellises.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management.</p>
