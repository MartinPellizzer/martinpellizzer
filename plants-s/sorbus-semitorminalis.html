<p>Sorbus semitorminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, spherical berries that are a striking feature of the species. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, showing a preference for well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively little-known species within the genus Sorbus.</p>
