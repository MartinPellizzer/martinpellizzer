<p>Selaginella cuernosensis, commonly known as the horned spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features creeping stems with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces cone-like structures that contain spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology, including the presence of specialized structures called "cushion" leaves, makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Selaginella cuernosensis is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions, which contributes to its ecological adaptability.</p>
