                    <h1>Stipa planaltina</h1>
<p>Stipa planaltina, commonly known as the plains needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa planaltina is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and grazing makes it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
