                    <h1>Spergula stricta</h1>
<p>Spergula stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers in spike-like clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Spergula stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
