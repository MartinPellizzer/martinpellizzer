                    <h1>Spartina juncea</h1>
<p>Spartina juncea, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and brackish water conditions. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Spartina juncea is also an important habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes form dense mats that help filter sediments and improve water quality in tidal wetlands.</p>
