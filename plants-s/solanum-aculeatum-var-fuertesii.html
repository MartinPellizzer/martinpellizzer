<p>Solanum aculeatum var. fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for cultivation and is more commonly encountered in the wild.</p>
