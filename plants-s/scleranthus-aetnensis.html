<p>Scleranthus aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its habitat. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing pinkish-white flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Scleranthus aetnensis is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
