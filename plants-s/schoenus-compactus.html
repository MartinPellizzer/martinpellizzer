                    <h1>Schoenus compactus</h1>
<p>Schoenus compactus, commonly known as the compact sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes during the growing season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus compactus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland sites.</p>
