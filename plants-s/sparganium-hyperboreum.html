<p>Sparganium hyperboreum, commonly known as the northern bur-reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish-green spikes of small flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruiting structures, called burrs, are covered in hooked bristles that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals.</p>
<p>Sparganium hyperboreum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
