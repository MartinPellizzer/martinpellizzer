<p>Senecio elaeagnifolius, commonly known as silverleaf senecio, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. It is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Silverleaf senecio is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient wildflower and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
