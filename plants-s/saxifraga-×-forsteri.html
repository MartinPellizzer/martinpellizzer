                    <h1>Saxifraga × forsteri</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × forsteri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga × forsteri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, well-drained soils.</p>
