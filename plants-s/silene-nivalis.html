                    <h1>Silene nivalis</h1>
<p>Silene nivalis, commonly known as the snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cold, rocky conditions. The plant produces showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Silene nivalis is also known for its ability to photosynthesize during the day and store energy in its underground roots for use during winter dormancy.</p>
