<p>Scleria tryonii, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Scleria tryonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
