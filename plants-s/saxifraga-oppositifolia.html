                    <h1>Saxifraga oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia, commonly known as the Arctic willow or mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky soils, due to its ability to tolerate cold and low-nutrient conditions. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping to retain moisture in dry, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia plays an important ecological role in polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
