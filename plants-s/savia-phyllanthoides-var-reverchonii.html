                    <h1>Savia phyllanthoides var. reverchonii</h1>
<p>Savia phyllanthoides var. reverchonii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
