<p>Synaedrys poculiformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cup-like structure that forms around the point of attachment. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Synaedrys poculiformis is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species.</p>
