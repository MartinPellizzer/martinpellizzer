                    <h1>Senegalia macrocephala</h1>
<p>Senegalia macrocephala, commonly known as the giant burr bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces large, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
<p>Its deep root system makes it valuable for soil stabilization and erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
