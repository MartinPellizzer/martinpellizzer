<p>Solanum tenuispinum, commonly known as the slender-spined nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, and it bears small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with small spines along the edges, contributing to its defensive characteristics.</p>
<p>Solanum tenuispinum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers.</p>
