<p>Solanum aviculare var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by round, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
