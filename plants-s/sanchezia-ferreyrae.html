                    <h1>Sanchezia ferreyrae</h1>
<p>Sanchezia ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's staghorn plant, is a rare species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red in color, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sanchezia ferreyrae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
