                    <h1>Sapindus mollis</h1>
<p>Sapindus mollis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange pulp. The fruit's outer layer is covered in a fine, soapy substance, which gives the plant its common name.</p>
<p>This unique feature has made it historically used for cleaning purposes by indigenous peoples.</p>
