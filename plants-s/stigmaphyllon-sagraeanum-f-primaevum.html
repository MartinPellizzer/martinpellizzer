                    <h1>Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum f. primaevum</h1>
<p>Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum f. primaevum, commonly known as the early-flowering stigmaphyllon, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with red flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a unique addition to specialized botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
