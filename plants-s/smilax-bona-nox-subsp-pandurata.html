<p>Smilax bona-nox subsp.</p>
<p>pandurata, commonly known as the red-veined arrowhead, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrowhead-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common invasive species in certain regions.</p>
