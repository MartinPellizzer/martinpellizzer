                    <h1>Stipa × tzvelevii</h1>
<p>Stipa × tzvelevii, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa trichophora.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, panicle-like inflorescences that are typically light green to golden in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, often found in temperate regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
