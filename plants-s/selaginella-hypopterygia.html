                    <h1>Selaginella hypopterygia</h1>
<p>Selaginella hypopterygia, commonly known as the clubmoss or ground pine, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Selaginella hypopterygia is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues.</p>
