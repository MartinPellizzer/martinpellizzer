                    <h1>Staehelina hastata</h1>
<p>Staehelina hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Staehelina hastata is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
