                    <h1>Sieversia andicola</h1>
<p>Sieversia andicola, commonly known as the Andean sievegrass, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are often borne on short pedicels. Sieversia andicola is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the Andean flora, though it is relatively obscure in horticultural cultivation.</p>
