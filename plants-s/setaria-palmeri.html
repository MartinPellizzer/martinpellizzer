<p>Setaria palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to golden brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Palmer's dropseed is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
