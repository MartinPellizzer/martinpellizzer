<p>Stelis silvestris, commonly known as the forest stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a distinct lip structure.</p>
<p>Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
