                    <h1>Staphidium pliostemon</h1>
<p>Staphidium pliostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed staphidium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Staphylinidae, which includes a diverse group of beetles rather than plants, indicating a possible taxonomic confusion. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth texture and a distinctive midrib.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, often greenish in color, and play a role in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
