                    <h1>Salix stagnalis</h1>
<p>Salix stagnalis, commonly known as the bog willow, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in northern regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments, contributing to ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Salix stagnalis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in peat bogs and along streams.</p>
