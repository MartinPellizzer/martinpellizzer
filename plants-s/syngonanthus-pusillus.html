                    <h1>Syngonanthus pusillus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in mild climates.</p>
