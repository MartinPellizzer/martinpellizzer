                    <h1>Stipagrostis lanipes</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis lanipes, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis lanipes is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
