                    <h1>Senecio eremophilus var. eremophilus</h1>
<p>Senecio eremophilus var. eremophilus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has fibrous roots and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to harsh, semi-arid conditions, with a low profile and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
