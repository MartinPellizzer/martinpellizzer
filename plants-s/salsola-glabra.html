                    <h1>Salsola glabra</h1>
<p>Salsola glabra, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent stems and small, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dry, wind-dispersed fruits. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Salsola glabra is also known for its role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in desert areas.</p>
