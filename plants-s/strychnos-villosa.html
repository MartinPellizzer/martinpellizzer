The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is considered poisonous and should be handled with care.</p>
