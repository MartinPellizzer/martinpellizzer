<p>Sopubia karaguensis var. karaguensis, commonly known as the Karaguen spongeplant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
