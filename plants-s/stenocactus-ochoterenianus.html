                    <h1>Stenocactus ochoterenianus</h1>
<p>Stenocactus ochoterenianus, commonly known as the Ochoterenianus cactus, is a rare and compact species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation.</p>
