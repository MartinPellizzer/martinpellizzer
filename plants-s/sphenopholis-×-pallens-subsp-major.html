<p>Sphenopholis × pallens subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the giant sphenophyllum, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Sphenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that resemble those of modern ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology suggests a close evolutionary relationship with early land plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
