                    <h1>Santalum raiateense</h1>
<p>Santalum raiateense, commonly known as the Tahitian sandalwood, is a species of tree native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Santalum raiateense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also culturally significant to the people of Tahiti.</p>
