<p>Saguaster angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saguaro, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that branches into spiny arms, which are used for photosynthesis. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically only present during the rainy season. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bats and birds.</p>
<p>The saguaster angustifolius is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and having a slow growth rate.</p>
