<p>Selaginella namdaphaensis, commonly known as the Namdapha spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
