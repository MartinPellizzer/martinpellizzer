<p>Seriphium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate hawkweed, is a low-growing flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, yellowish flowers clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Seriphium prostratum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
