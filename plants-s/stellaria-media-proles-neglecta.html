<p>Stellaria media proles neglecta, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>

The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are hairy and often covered with tiny white glands. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a useful plant in ecological studies.</p>
