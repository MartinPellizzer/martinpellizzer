                    <h1>Serapias × forestieri</h1>
<p>Serapias × forestieri, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Serapias nemorosa and Serapias orchidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral hues, with elongated, spurred petals that are typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and marshy habitats across southern Europe. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and hoverflies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
