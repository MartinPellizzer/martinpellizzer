<p>Salgada lauriflora, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like birds and bees. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
