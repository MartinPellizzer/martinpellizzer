<p>Saxifraga dumetorum, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found in crevices and on slopes where it can anchor itself firmly. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga dumetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
