<p>Stilaginella ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a cradle for its aerial roots. The plant's name derives from the reddish-brown coloration of its stems and the appearance of its leaves, which resemble the antlers of a stag. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Stilaginella ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
