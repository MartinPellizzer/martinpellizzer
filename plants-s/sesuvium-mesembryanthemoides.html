<p>Sesuvium mesembryanthemoides, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in sandy or coastal areas.</p>
