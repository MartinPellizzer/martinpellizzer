                    <h1>Senegalia polyphylla</h1>
<p>Senegalia polyphylla, commonly known as the catclaw acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures on the stems, and its distinctive, thorned pods. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senegalia polyphylla is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
