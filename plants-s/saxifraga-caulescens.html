<p>Saxifraga caulescens, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Saxifraga caulescens is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in open, sunny habitats.</p>
