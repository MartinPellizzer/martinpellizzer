                    <h1>Salix × dichroa var. obovata</h1>
<p>Salix × dichroa var. obovata, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a broad base and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its medicinal properties, as its bark contains salicin, a compound similar to aspirin.</p>
