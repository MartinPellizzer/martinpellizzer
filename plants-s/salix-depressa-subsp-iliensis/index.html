                            <h1>Salix Depressa Subsp. Iliensis</h1>
<p>Salix depressa subsp. iliensis is a rare and lesser-known member of the willow family found in specific regions of central Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit and unique leaf morphology that distinguishes it from other willow species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists. However, it remains understudied, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
