<p>Saccharum caudatum, commonly known as the tufted bamboo or bamboo grass, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 6 meters in height, with dense, tufted clusters of leaves at the top. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in panicles. Its roots are fibrous and capable of forming dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Saccharum caudatum is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
