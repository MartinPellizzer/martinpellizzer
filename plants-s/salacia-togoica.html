                    <h1>Salacia togoica</h1>
<p>Salacia togoica, commonly known as Togo's salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by opposite, ovate leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
