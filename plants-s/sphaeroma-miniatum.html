                    <h1>Sphaeroma miniatum</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma miniatum, commonly known as the dwarf moon snail, is a small, marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Naticidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, oval shell that is typically white or pale in color, with a slight spiral pattern. The species is primarily found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on bivalves such as clams and mussels. Its body is soft and muscular, allowing it to burrow through sand and sediment with ease.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a member of the animal kingdom.</p>
