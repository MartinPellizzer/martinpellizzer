<p>Selliguea lanceola, commonly known as the lanceolate liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, giving it its common name. Selliguea lanceola lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a structure called a thallus.</p>
