                    <h1>Senegalia rostrata</h1>
<p>Senegalia rostrata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines, and its yellow, globular inflorescences that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds with a hard coat, adapted for dispersal by animals or through wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Senegalia rostrata is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
