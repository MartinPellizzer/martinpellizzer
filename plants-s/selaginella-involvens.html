                    <h1>Selaginella involvens</h1>
<p>Selaginella involvens, commonly known as the stair-step moss or resurrection plant, is a species of spore-bearing vascular plant in the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, as it can lose up to 95% of its water content and still recover when rehydrated. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on tree trunks.</p>
<p>Its unique resilience and ability to "resurrect" after drying have made it a subject of scientific interest.</p>
