<p>Senegalia × emoryana, commonly known as the Emory acacia, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in arid conditions, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Its bark and wood have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
