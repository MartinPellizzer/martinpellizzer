                    <h1>Sclerochloa angusta</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of pale to dark brown seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish dense vegetation in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa angusta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
