                    <h1>Santalum densiflorum</h1>
<p>Santalum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers make it an ornamental plant as well.</p>
<p>Santalum densiflorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
