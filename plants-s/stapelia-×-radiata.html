                    <h1>Stapelia × radiata</h1>
<p>Stapelia × radiata, commonly known as the star stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with minimal water.</p>
<p>Stapelia × radiata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
