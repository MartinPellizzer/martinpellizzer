                    <h1>Silphiosperma perpusillum</h1>
<p>Silphiosperma perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant was historically cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly for its purported ability to enhance fertility. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered extinct in the wild, though some cultivated specimens still exist in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its historical use and its role in ancient herbal medicine.</p>
