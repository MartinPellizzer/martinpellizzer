<p>Synaedrys lappacea, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Synaedrys lappacea is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
