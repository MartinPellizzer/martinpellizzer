                    <h1>Sagus genuina</h1>
<p>Sagus genuina, commonly known as the rare endemic plant of the Canary Islands, is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with a woody base, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring, producing yellowish-green blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sagus genuina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
