<p>Sorengia anceps subsp.</p>
<p>rhizomata, commonly known as the rhizomatous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and often invasive species in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this subspecies are well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
