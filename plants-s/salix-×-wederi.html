                    <h1>Salix × wederi</h1>
<p>Salix × wederi, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix × wederi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its graceful form and spring foliage.</p>
