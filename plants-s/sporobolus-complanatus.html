                    <h1>Sporobolus complanatus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus complanatus, commonly known as flatleaf sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Sporobolus complanatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>
