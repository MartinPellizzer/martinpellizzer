<p>Struthiopteris revoluta, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin that gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
