<p>Salix sibirica, commonly known as Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grey, and it is known for its hardiness in harsh, northern environments.</p>
