<p>Salix nigricans var. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its foliage is often a vibrant green in summer, turning yellow in autumn, and it plays a role in providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The variety subrotunda is distinguished by its more elongated and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Salix nigricans.</p>
