                    <h1>Salvia lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Salvia lanuginosa, commonly known as wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, which gives it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>Salvia lanuginosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
