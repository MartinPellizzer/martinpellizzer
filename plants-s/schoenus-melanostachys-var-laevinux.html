                    <h1>Schoenus melanostachys var. laevinux</h1>
<p>Schoenus melanostachys var. laevinux, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed flax sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms.</p>
