<p>Stenandrium floridanum is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It is known for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This species belongs to the orchid family and is often found in swampy areas with high humidity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and protected in many regions. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
