<p>Salsola scopiformis, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects.</p>
<p>Salsola scopiformis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
