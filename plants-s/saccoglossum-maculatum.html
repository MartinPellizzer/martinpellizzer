<p>Saccoglossum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>

This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and other plant matter. Its anatomy includes a muscular foot used for movement and a radula for grazing.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a member of the animal kingdom.</p>
