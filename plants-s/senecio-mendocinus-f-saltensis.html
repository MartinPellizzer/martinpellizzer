<p>Senecio mendocinus f. saltensis, commonly known as the Salt Desert Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme desert conditions.</p>
