                    <h1>Sisymbrium clandestinum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium clandestinum, commonly known as the secret broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its reduced morphology and specialized root structures for attachment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be harmful to agricultural crops, making it a concern for farmers.</p>
<p>Its life cycle and ecological impact make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
