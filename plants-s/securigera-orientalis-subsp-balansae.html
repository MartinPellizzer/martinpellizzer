<p>Securigera orientalis subsp.</p>
<p>balansae, commonly known as the Balansae milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing structure and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
