                    <h1>Sagittaria natans var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Sagittaria natans var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots anchoring it to the substrate. Its small, white flowers emerge on slender stalks above the water, often in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to wetland habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
