The plant produces tall, branched stems with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an excellent ground cover in arid environments.</p>
