                    <h1>Staelia virgata var. correntina</h1>
<p>Staelia virgata var. correntina, commonly known as the Brazilian broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often inconspicuous and lack showy petals. Its structure is adapted for a hemiparasitic lifestyle, with a short stem and a taproot that attaches to the host.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
