                    <h1>Seddera humilis var. erlangeriana</h1>
<p>Seddera humilis var. erlangeriana, commonly known as the Erlanger's seddera, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates.</p>
