<p>Stelis gracilis, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, often pendulous stems that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small, white to pale green, and typically bloom in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Stelis gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
