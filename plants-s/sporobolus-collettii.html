<p>Sporobolus collettii, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Sporobolus collettii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock and wildlife.</p>
