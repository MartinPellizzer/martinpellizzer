                    <h1>Sisymbrium waltheri</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium waltheri, commonly known as the Walther's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to regions of the western United States and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
