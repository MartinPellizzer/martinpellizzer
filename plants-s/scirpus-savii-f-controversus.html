The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a robust growth habit that allows it to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
