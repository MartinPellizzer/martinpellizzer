<p>Selliguea matutumensis, commonly known as the morning glory fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and small, overlapping leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Selliguea matutumensis is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
