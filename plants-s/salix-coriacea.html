                    <h1>Salix coriacea</h1>
<p>Salix coriacea, commonly known as the rough-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark that becomes rough and scaly with age. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in basket-making.</p>
