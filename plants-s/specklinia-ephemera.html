                    <h1>Specklinia ephemera</h1>
<p>Specklinia ephemera, commonly known as the fleeting fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant's foliage consists of slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Specklinia ephemera is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
