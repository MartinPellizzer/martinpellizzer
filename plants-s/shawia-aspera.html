                    <h1>Shawia aspera</h1>
<p>Shawia aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf shawia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Shawia aspera has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
