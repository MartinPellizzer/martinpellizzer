                    <h1>Scytalia danura</h1>
<p>Scytalia danura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. Scytalia danura thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
