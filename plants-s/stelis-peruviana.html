                    <h1>Stelis peruviana</h1>
<p>Stelis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings.</p>
