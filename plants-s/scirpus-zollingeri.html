<p>Scirpus zollingeri, commonly known as Zollinger's bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes shorelines. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus zollingeri plays a vital role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
