                    <h1>Stenopadus andicola</h1>
<p>Stenopadus andicola, commonly known as the Andean padbrack, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and features small, thick leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind or insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenopadus andicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
