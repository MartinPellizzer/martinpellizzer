                    <h1>Salicornia persica</h1>
<p>Salicornia persica, commonly known as Persian glassweed, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important species for ecological studies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to high-salt conditions make it a subject of interest in both botany and agriculture.</p>
