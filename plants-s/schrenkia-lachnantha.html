                    <h1>Schrenkia lachnantha</h1>
<p>Schrenkia lachnantha, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, erect stems that bear showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Schrenkia lachnantha is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for thriving in desert conditions.</p>
