                    <h1>Stipa borysthenica var. germanica</h1>
<p>Stipa borysthenica var. germanica, commonly known as the German feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is due to its delicate, feathery appearance and its ability to form dense, attractive clumps.</p>
