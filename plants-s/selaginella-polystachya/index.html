<p>Selaginella polystachya, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a fascinating member of the lycophyte group. This ancient plant has existed for over 300 million years and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its unique structure includes small, scale-like leaves and upright, branching stems. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It plays an important role in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
