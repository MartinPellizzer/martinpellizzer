<p>Sideroxylon lanuginosum subsp.</p>
<p>lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which provides protection against drought and herbivory.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
