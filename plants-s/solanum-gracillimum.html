                    <h1>Solanum gracillimum</h1>
<p>Solanum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, arid environments. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological adaptations, Solanum gracillimum is of interest to botanists studying plant responses to extreme climates.</p>
