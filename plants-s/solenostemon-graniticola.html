<p>Solenostemon graniticola, commonly known as the granite stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
