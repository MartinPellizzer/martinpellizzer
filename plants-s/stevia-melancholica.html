                    <h1>Stevia melancholica</h1>
<p>Stevia melancholica, commonly known as the bitter stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its intense bitterness, which is attributed to the presence of steviol glycosides. While it is not as widely cultivated as other stevia species, it has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from the more commercially popular Stevia rebaudiana.</p>
