                    <h1>Salvia pallida</h1>
<p>Salvia pallida, commonly known as pale salvia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Salvia pallida is valued in both gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
