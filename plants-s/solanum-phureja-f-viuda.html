<p>Solanum phureja f. viuda, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a unique variant of the passionflower genus native to South America.</p>

The plant is a climbing vine that produces edible berries, though they are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of the standard passionfruit. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The f. viuda form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a subject of botanical study.</p>
