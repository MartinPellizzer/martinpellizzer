                            <h1>Sida Ortegae</h1>
<p>Sida ortegae is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Mexico. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along the shores of the Gulf of California. This plant is known for its striking blue and purple flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Sida ortegae is considered endangered and requires urgent protection efforts.</p>
