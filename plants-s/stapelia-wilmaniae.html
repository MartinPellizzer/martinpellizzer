<p>Stapelia wilmaniae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often star-shaped flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature that aids in attracting specific pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall desert-adapted morphology.</p>
<p>Stapelia wilmaniae blooms in the evening, releasing a strong odor to mimic the scent of decaying flesh.</p>
