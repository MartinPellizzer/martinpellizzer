                    <h1>Selenipedium longifolium var. coloratum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium longifolium var. coloratum, commonly known as the purple-flowered staghorn orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and its distinctive, showy purple flowers that resemble the antlers of a stag. It is a terrestrial orchid with a complex root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
