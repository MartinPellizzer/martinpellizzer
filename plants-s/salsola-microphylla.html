<p>Salsola microphylla, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Salsola microphylla is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
