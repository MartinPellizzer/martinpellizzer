                    <h1>Salvinia affinis</h1>
<p>Salvinia affinis, commonly known as water spangles, is a small, floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Salvinia affinis can form dense mats on the water, which can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
<p>It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches.</p>
