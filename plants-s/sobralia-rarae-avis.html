<p>Sobralia rarae-avis, commonly known as the rare avian sobralia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that resemble birds in shape and color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are pollinated by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sobralia rarae-avis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
