                    <h1>Schedonorus sterilis</h1>
<p>Schedonorus sterilis, commonly known as the sterile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, soft blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Schedonorus sterilis is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
