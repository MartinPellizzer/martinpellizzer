                    <h1>Symphyglossum</h1>
<p>Symphyglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Symphyglossum is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
