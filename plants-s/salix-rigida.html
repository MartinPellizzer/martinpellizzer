                <h1>Salix rigida</h1>
<p>Salix rigida, commonly known as the rigid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, marshes, or other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination.</p>
<p>Salix rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in basket weaving and as a source of flexible wood.</p>
