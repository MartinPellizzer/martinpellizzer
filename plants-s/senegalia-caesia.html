<p>Senegalia caesia, commonly known as the bluebrush acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and its distinctive blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods, and the plant is adapted to survive in drought conditions with deep root systems.</p>
<p>Senegalia caesia is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
