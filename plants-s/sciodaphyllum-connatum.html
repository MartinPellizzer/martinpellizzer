                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum connatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum connatum, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in the shaded understory of dense tropical forests, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically blooming in the early morning.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum connatum is considered critically endangered.</p>
