<p>Sporobolus indicus var. major, commonly known as the Indian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
