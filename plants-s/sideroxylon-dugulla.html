<p>Sideroxylon dugulla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon dugulla is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
