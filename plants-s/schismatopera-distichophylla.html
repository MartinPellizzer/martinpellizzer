<p>Schismatopera distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leafed fern, is a fossilized plant from the Devonian period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern, which resembles a modern fern. The plant's fronds are preserved in fine detail, showing intricate leaf structures. It is one of the earliest known plants to exhibit true leaves, indicating advanced vascular systems.</p>
<p>This species provides important insights into early plant evolution and the development of complex terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
