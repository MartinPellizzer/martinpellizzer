<p>Spergula repens, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the soil surface. The leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>Spergula repens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
