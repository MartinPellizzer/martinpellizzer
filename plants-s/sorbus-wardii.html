<p>Sorbus wardii, commonly known as the Ward's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Sorbus wardii is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
