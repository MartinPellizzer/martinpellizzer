                    <h1>Sedum lagascae</h1>
<p>Sedum lagascae, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in challenging environments.</p>
