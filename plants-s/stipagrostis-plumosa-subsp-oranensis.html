<p>Stipagrostis plumosa subsp.</p>
<p>oranensis, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted, silver-green foliage and slender, feathery panicles that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
