                    <h1>Saxifraga fortunei var. pilosissima</h1>
<p>Saxifraga fortunei var. pilosissima, commonly known as the fuzzy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates.</p>
