                    <h1>Stelis reitzii</h1>
<p>Stelis reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctively shaped lip. Its growth habit involves forming pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Stelis reitzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
