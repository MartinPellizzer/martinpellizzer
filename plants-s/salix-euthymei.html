<p>Salix euthymei, commonly known as the Euthymic willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Salix euthymei is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
