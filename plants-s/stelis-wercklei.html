<p>Stelis wercklei, commonly known as the Werckle's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale green with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis wercklei is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests.</p>
