<p>Silene colorata subsp.</p>
<p>saxicola, commonly known as the saxicolous silene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in well-drained soils on cliffs, scree slopes, and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in mountainous regions.</p>
