                    <h1>Simsia subaristata</h1>
<p>Simsia subaristata, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Simsia subaristata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its low-growing structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh desert conditions.</p>
