<p>Samadera indica var. brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petaled Indian sandalwood, is a variant of the Indian sandalwood tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and incense.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the standard Samadera indica and is often found in specific regions of India.</p>
