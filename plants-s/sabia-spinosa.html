                    <h1>Sabia spinosa</h1>
<p>Sabia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny sabia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sabia spinosa is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can store water in its thickened stems.</p>
