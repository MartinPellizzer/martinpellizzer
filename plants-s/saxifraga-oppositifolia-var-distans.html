                    <h1>Saxifraga oppositifolia var. distans</h1>
<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia var. distans, commonly known as the Arctic sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and produces small, pink or white flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in tundra and mountain environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
