                    <h1>Salicornia intermedia</h1>
<p>Salicornia intermedia, commonly known as glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, jointed stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green or red flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, which help minimize water evaporation.</p>
<p>Salicornia intermedia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
