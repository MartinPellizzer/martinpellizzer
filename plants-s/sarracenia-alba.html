                    <h1>Sarracenia alba</h1>
<p>Sarracenia alba, commonly known as the white pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, white, tubular leaves that form specialized pitfall traps. These traps secrete a sticky liquid that lures and traps insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Its striking white coloration and unique trapping mechanism make it a distinctive and fascinating species within the Sarraceniaceae family.</p>
