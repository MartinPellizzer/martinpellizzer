                    <h1>Scaliopsis</h1>
<p>Scaliopsis, commonly known as the scalycap orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Scaliopsis species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
