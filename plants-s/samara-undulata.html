                    <h1>Samara undulata</h1>
<p>Samara undulata, commonly known as the wavy samara or wavy winged fruit, is a unique botanical structure that develops from the seeds of certain plants, particularly in the genus Celtis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flat, and undulating wing-like shape, which aids in wind dispersal. The samara typically contains a single seed enclosed within a thin, papery layer. This type of fruit is commonly found in the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries.</p>
<p>Its structure not only facilitates seed dispersal but also contributes to the plant's ecological role in various habitats.</p>
