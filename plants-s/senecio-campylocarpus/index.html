                            <h1>Senecio Campylocarpus</h1>
<p>Senecio campylocarpus is a striking member of the Asteraceae family known for its unique, balloon-like seed heads. Native to South Africa, this plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its vibrant green foliage and showy, yellow-centered flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's name comes from the Greek words for "bending" and "fruit," referencing its distinctive seed structure. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties.</p>
