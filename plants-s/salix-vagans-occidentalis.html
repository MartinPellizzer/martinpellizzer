                    <h1>Salix vagans occidentalis</h1>
<p>Salix vagans occidentalis, commonly known as the western willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in riparian ecosystems.</p>
