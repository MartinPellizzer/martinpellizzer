                    <h1>Swartzia racemosa var. klugii</h1>
<p>Swartzia racemosa var. klugii, commonly known as the Klug's yellowwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and workability. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by long, narrow pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects.</p>
