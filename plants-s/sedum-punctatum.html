                    <h1>Sedum punctatum</h1>
<p>Sedum punctatum, commonly known as the punctate stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
