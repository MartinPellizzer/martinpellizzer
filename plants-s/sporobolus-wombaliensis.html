<p>Sporobolus wombaliensis, commonly known as the Wombali grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Sporobolus wombaliensis is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock.</p>
