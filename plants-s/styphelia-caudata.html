<p>Styphelia caudata, commonly known as the trailing snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its compact foliage. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like form, helping it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Styphelia caudata is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
