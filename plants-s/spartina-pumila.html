<p>Spartina pumila, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass found in coastal salt marshes.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it tolerate saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Spartina pumila plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in brackish water makes it an important component of estuarine ecosystems.</p>
