<p>Selliguea malacodon, commonly known as the Malacodon liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the phyllidia.</p>
<p>Selliguea malacodon plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
