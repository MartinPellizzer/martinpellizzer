The leaves are needle-like, dark green, and slightly serrated, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-elevation forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
