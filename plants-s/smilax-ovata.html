<p>Smilax ovata, commonly known as the oval-stemmed catbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in woodland and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Smilax ovata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
