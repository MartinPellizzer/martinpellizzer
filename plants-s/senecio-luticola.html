<p>Senecio luticola, commonly known as the Lake Turkana senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Senecio luticola plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for local wildlife.</p>
