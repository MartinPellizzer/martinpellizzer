<p>Salix damascena, commonly known as the Persian poplar or white willow, is a deciduous tree native to regions of Asia, including Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and long, narrow leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or green. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin strips, and it is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin.</p>
<p>Salix damascena is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
