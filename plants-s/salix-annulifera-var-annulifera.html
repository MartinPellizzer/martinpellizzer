                    <h1>Salix annulifera var. annulifera</h1>
<p>Salix annulifera var. annulifera, commonly known as the ringed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its cold hardiness, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
