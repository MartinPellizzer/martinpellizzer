                    <h1>Schoenus armeria</h1>
<p>Schoenus armeria, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Schoenus armeria plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
