<p>Schoenoplectus lacustris f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
