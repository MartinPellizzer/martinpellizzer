                    <h1>Saltzwedelia</h1>
<p>Saltzwedelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's botanical features include long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower with a distinctive white and green coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
