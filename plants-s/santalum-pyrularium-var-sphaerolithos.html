                    <h1>Santalum pyrularium var. sphaerolithos</h1>
<p>Santalum pyrularium var. sphaerolithos, commonly known as the golden sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued species of the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is prized for its fragrance and durability. The plant is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
