                    <h1>Santalum boninense</h1>
<p>Santalum boninense, commonly known as the Bonin sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, ellipsoid-shaped fruits containing single seeds. Its aromatic wood has been historically valued for use in incense and fine furniture, leading to significant habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
