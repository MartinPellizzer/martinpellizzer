<p>Salvia clandestina subsp.</p>
<p>multifida, commonly known as the multifid leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and its distinctive, deeply lobed, multifid leaves that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and showy blooms attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
