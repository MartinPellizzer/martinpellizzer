<p>Salsola gemmascens subsp.</p>
<p>nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular Russian thistle, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that often branch near the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spiny leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it thrives in coastal and inland saline habitats.</p>
