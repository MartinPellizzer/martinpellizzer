<p>Sempervivum × exsul, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sempervivum × exsul is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it easy to cultivate and spread.</p>
