                    <h1>Spergula rosea</h1>
<p>Spergula rosea, commonly known as rose bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Spergula rosea is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
