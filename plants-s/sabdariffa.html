<p>Sabdariffa, commonly known as roselle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive calyces, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The calyces are harvested and used to make tea, jams, and sauces due to their tart flavor and high vitamin C content.</p>
<p>Sabdariffa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>
