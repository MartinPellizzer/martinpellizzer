                    <h1>Selliguea echinospora</h1>
<p>Selliguea echinospora, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form.</p>
<p>It is a moss that typically grows on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown stem with closely spaced, leaf-like structures that are often covered in a layer of fine, silvery hairs. Its sporophytes are short and stout, with a capsule that is covered in a thick, persistent calyptra.</p>
<p>Selliguea echinospora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other desert organisms.</p>
