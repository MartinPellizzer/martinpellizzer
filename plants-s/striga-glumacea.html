                    <h1>Striga glumacea</h1>
<p>Striga glumacea, commonly known as the witchgrass, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of cereal crops like maize and wheat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in regions where its hosts are cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields and is considered a major agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
