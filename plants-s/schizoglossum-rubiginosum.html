<p>Schizoglossum rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically reddish in color due to the presence of anthocyanins. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Schizoglossum rubiginosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
