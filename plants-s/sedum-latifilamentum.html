                    <h1>Sedum latifilamentum</h1>
<p>Sedum latifilamentum, commonly known as the broad filament sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
