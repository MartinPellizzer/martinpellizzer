<p>Selaginella pteryphyllos, commonly known as the climbing clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains sporangia. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Selaginella pteryphyllos is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of plant evolution.</p>
