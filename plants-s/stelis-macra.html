                    <h1>Stelis macra</h1>
<p>Stelis macra, commonly known as the large-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are aerial, allowing it to attach to trees or other substrates in its natural environment.</p>
<p>Stelis macra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
