<p>Swainsona beasleyana subsp.</p>
<p>elegantoides, commonly known as the elegant mimic bean, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through mechanisms like deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This subspecies is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which contribute to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
