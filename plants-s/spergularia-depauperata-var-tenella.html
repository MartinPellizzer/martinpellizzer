                    <h1>Spergularia depauperata var. tenella</h1>
<p>Spergularia depauperata var. tenella, commonly known as the slender sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, including dunes and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant resilience in extreme conditions.</p>
