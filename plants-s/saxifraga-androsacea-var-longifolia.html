                    <h1>Saxifraga androsacea var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga androsacea var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it forms low, compact rosettes of dark green, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a terminal cyme. Its leaves are characterized by their elongated shape and dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Saxifraga androsacea var. longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
