                    <h1>Sesuvium crystallinum</h1>
<p>Sesuvium crystallinum, commonly known as crystalline sesuvium, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by clusters of small, bead-like fruits. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
