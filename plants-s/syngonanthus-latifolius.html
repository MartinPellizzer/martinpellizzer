                    <h1>Syngonanthus latifolius</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, evergreen stems that often hang from branches, and its leaves are broad, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Syngonanthus latifolius plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
