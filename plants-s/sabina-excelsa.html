                    <h1>Sabina excelsa</h1>
<p>Sabina excelsa, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
