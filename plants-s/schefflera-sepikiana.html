                    <h1>Schefflera sepikiana</h1>
<p>Schefflera sepikiana, commonly known as the Sepik schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Sepik River region of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Schefflera sepikiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings outside its native range.</p>
