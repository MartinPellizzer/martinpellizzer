                    <h1>Sagina procumbens var. apetala</h1>
<p>Sagina procumbens var. apetala, commonly known as the leafy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves that are typically opposite or whorled along the stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often reduced or absent in this variety, giving it its name "apetala," meaning "without petals.". It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
