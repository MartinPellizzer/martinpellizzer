<p>It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is widely used in lawns and landscapes due to its tolerance of heat and humidity.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread and form a thick turf.</p>
