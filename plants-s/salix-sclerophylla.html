                    <h1>Salix sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Salix sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, narrow leaves that are thick and leathery, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
