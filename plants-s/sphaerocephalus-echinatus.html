                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus echinatus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus with a dense, spiny surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. Its spiny appearance is due to the presence of raised, waxy projections on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The lichen is often found in shaded, moist environments and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
