<p>Scleria radula, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond margins and damp meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Scleria radula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland habitats.</p>
