                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos alticola</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos alticola, commonly known as the highland starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
