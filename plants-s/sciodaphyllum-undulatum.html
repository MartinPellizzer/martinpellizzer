                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum undulatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating shadow fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, undulating fronds that give it a distinctive, wave-like appearance. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum undulatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
