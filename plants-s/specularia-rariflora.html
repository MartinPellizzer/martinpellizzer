<p>Specularia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered specter, is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Specularia rariflora is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
