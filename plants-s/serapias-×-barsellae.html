<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display a mix of yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the wet environment, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Serapias × barsellae is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
