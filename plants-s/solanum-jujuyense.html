                    <h1>Solanum jujuyense</h1>
<p>Solanum jujuyense, commonly known as the Jujuy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant bears red, fleshy berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially dangerous if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Solanum jujuyense is often found in rocky soils and is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
