<p>Seseli rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>acaule, commonly known as the stiff milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and reduced stem, with leaves that are often sparsely distributed along the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The subspecies acaule is distinguished by the absence of a distinct stem, with the leaves directly arising from the base of the plant.</p>
