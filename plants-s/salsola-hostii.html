                    <h1>Salsola hostii</h1>
<p>Salsola hostii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Salsola hostii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
