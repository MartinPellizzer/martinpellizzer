<p>Salix saposhnikovii, commonly known as the Chinese willow or Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges.</p>
<p>Salix saposhnikovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
