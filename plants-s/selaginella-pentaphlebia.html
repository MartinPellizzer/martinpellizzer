                    <h1>Selaginella pentaphlebia</h1>
<p>Selaginella pentaphlebia, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery leaves that form a dense, grass-like rosette, often with a distinctive tongue-like shape. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices. It exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without dying.</p>
<p>Selaginella pentaphlebia is also noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized horticulture.</p>
