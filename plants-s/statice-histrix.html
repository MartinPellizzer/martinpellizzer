                    <h1>Statice histrix</h1>
<p>Statice histrix, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its silver-gray foliage helps it resist salt spray and wind, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Statice histrix is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms.</p>
