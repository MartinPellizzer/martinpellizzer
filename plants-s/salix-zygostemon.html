<p>Salix zygostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male and female flowering structures, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a fragrant, resinous scent.</p>
<p>Salix zygostemon is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest edges.</p>
