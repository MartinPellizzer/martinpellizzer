<p>Senna hirsuta var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, which distinguishes it from other senna species. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye due to its chemical compounds.</p>
