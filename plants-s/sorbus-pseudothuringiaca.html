                    <h1>Sorbus pseudothuringiaca</h1>
<p>Sorbus pseudothuringiaca, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
