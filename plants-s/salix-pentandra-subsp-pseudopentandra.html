<p>Salix pentandra subsp.</p>
<p>pseudopentandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The leaves and branches are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
