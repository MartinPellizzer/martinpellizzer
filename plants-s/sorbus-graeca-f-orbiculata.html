                    <h1>Sorbus graeca f. orbiculata</h1>
<p>Sorbus graeca f. orbiculata, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are typically glaucous and have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates.</p>
