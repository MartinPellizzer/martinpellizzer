<p>Salix lapponum subsp.</p>
<p>ceretana, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
<p>The leaves and young shoots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role is more significant in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
