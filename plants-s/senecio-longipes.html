<p>Senecio longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed groundsel, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio longipes is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
