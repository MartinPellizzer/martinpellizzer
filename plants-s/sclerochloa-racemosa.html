                    <h1>Sclerochloa racemosa</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa racemosa, commonly known as the tufted beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow, tough, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa racemosa is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
