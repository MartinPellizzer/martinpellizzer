                    <h1>Stenochilus pterocarpus</h1>
<p>Stenochilus pterocarpus, commonly known as the Indian shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are palmately lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
