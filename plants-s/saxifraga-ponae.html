                    <h1>Saxifraga ponae</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ponae, commonly known as the St. Helena saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent, which helps it retain moisture in the arid conditions it encounters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat degradation, Saxifraga ponae is considered critically endangered.</p>
