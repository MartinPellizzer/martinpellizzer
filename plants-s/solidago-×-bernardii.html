<p>Solidago × bernardii, commonly known as the hybrid goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Solidago canadensis and Solidago rugosa, resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and floral characteristics. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, while the inflorescence consists of bright yellow, rayless flowers arranged in dense, cone-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
