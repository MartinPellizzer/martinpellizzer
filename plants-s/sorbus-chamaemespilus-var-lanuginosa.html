                    <h1>Sorbus chamaemespilus var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Sorbus chamaemespilus var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly-gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
