<p>Somerauera grignensis, commonly known as the Grignan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
