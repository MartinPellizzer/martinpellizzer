<p>Stelis richardii, commonly known as the Richard's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis richardii is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
