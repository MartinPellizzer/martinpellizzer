                    <h1>Stapelia namaquensis var. bidens</h1>
<p>Stapelia namaquensis var. bidens, commonly known as the two-toothed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green, waxy flowers with a distinctive odor resembling decay, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>This variety is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
