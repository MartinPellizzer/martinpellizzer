                    <h1>Selaginella apus var. minor</h1>
<p>Selaginella apus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. This variety is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of North America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, and it is adapted to survive in environments with low moisture.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
