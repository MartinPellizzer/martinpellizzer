                    <h1>Spergula saginoides var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Spergula saginoides var. nivalis, commonly known as snowgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or barren ground.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth patterns make it well-suited for harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
