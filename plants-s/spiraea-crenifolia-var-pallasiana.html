<p>Spiraea crenifolia var. pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
