<p>Sagittaria purshii, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a water plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Sagittaria purshii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
