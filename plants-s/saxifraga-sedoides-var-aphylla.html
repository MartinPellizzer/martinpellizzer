                    <h1>Saxifraga sedoides var. aphylla</h1>
<p>Saxifraga sedoides var. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments.</p>
<p>This variant is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
