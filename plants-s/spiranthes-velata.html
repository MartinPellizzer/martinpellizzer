                    <h1>Spiranthes velata</h1>
<p>Spiranthes velata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and cypress swamps, typically in the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
