                    <h1>Scorzonera angustifolia</h1>
<p>Scorzonera angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Scorzonera angustifolia is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cooler, well-drained conditions.</p>
