<p>Suaeda heteroptera, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Suaeda heteroptera plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
