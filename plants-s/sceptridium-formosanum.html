                    <h1>Sceptridium formosanum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan fan-fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
