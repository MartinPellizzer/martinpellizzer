                    <h1>Salix kalarica</h1>
<p>Salix kalarica, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and capable of stabilizing soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Salix kalarica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
