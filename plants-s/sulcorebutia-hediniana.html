<p>Sulcorebutia hediniana, commonly known as the Hedin's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, segmented stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
