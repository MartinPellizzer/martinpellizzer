<p>Silene rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is adapted to tolerate waterlogged and salty soils, which is essential for its survival in coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Silene rhizophora plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
