<p>Solanum ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and limited study, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
