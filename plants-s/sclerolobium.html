                    <h1>Sclerolobium</h1>
<p>Sclerolobium, commonly known as the African bristlecone acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their woody, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Sclerolobium species are native to southern Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They produce small, yellow to green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor regions.</p>
