<p>Sinarundinaria acutissima, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are pinnately compound with lance-shaped pinnae, and the spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
