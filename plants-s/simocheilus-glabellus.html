<p>Simocheilus glabellus, commonly known as the smooth-faced sandpiper, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and tidal areas. Its root system helps stabilize the soil, preventing erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
