<p>Small bulrush, scientifically known as Scirpus micranthus var. minor, is a hardy aquatic plant commonly found in wetlands and marshy areas. It thrives in shallow waters and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered flower heads. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its presence often indicates healthy wetland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is both a valuable native species and a potential invasive in certain regions.</p>
