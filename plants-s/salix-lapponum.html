<p>Salix lapponum, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination.</p>
<p>Salix lapponum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and subarctic environments.</p>
