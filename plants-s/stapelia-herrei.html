                    <h1>Stapelia herrei</h1>
<p>Stapelia herrei, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia herrei is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and distinctive appearance.</p>
