<p>Saccoloma elegans var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican elegant saccoloma, is a species of fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely serrated margin that distinguishes it from other similar species.</p>
