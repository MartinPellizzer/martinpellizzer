                    <h1>Senecio laxus</h1>
<p>Senecio laxus, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, grayish-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens outside its native range.</p>
