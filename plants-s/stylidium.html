                    <h1>Stylidium</h1>
<p>Stylidium, commonly known as the sticky seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique seed structure, where the seeds are attached to a fleshy, sticky stalk that aids in seed dispersal. Stylidium species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They produce small, showy flowers that are often brightly colored to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are native to Australia and South America.</p>
