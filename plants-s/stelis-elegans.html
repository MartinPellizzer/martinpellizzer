<p>Stelis elegans, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant appearance.</p>
<p>Stelis elegans thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
