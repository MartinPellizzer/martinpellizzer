                    <h1>Sporobolus foliosus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus foliosus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing habit, making it suitable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas.</p>
