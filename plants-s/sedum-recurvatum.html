<p>Sedum recurvatum, commonly known as the recurved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Sedum recurvatum is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
