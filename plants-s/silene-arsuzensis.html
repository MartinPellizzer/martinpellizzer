<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
