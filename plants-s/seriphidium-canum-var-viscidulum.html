                    <h1>Seriphidium canum var. viscidulum</h1>
<p>Seriphidium canum var. viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky tansy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a sticky texture, a feature that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties make it a subject of interest in both ecological and medicinal studies.</p>
