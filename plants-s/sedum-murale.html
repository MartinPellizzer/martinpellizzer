                    <h1>Sedum murale</h1>
<p>Sedum murale, commonly known as the wall sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form dense mats, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and withstand drought conditions makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum murale is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ecological benefits, such as providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
