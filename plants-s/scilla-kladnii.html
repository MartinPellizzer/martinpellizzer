                    <h1>Scilla kladnii</h1>
<p>Scilla kladnii, commonly known as the Balkan squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are toxic and contain cardiac glycosides, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Scilla kladnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
