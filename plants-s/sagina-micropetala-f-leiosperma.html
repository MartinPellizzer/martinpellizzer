<p>Sagina micropetala f. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides, disturbed areas, and in open plains.</p>
