                    <h1>Salix mexicana</h1>
<p>Salix mexicana, commonly known as Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant has slender, often zigzagging branches and small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Salix mexicana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in its native environment.</p>
