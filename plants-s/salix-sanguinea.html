                    <h1>Salix sanguinea</h1>
<p>Salix sanguinea, commonly known as the blood willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers early in the spring before its leaves fully emerge. Salix sanguinea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or moist woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various arctic and subarctic wildlife species.</p>
