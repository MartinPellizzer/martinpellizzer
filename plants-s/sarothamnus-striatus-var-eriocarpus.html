<p>Sarothamnus striatus var. eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly thornstep, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by small, spherical fruits that are typically hairy or woolly in texture. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced woolly features compared to the typical form of Sarothamnus striatus.</p>
