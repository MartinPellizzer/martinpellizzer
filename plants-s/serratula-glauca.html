                    <h1>Serratula glauca</h1>
<p>Serratula glauca, commonly known as blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from June to September. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, pappus-equipped capsule, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Serratula glauca is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
