                    <h1>Salisburia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Salisburia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with spores released into the water column.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological significance in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
