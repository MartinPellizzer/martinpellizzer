<p>Sabina jarkendensis, commonly known as the Jarkend pine, is a rare conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabina jarkendensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
