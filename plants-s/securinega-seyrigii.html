                    <h1>Securinega seyrigii</h1>
<p>Securinega seyrigii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Securinega seyrigii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
