                    <h1>Saxifraga drabiformis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga drabiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Saxifraga drabiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
