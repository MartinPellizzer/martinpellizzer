<p>Scirpus subcapitatus subsp.</p>
<p>pulogensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clumps with tall, narrow leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color, distinguishing it from other bulrush species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
