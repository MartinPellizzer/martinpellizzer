                    <h1>Salvia dolichorrhiza</h1>
<p>Salvia dolichorrhiza, commonly known as the long-root sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and tall, spires of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its long, fibrous roots help it survive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Salvia dolichorrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes.</p>
