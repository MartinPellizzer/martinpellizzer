<p>Solanum leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale green foliage, which contrasts with its small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings.</p>
