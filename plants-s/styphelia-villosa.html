                    <h1>Styphelia villosa</h1>
<p>Styphelia villosa, commonly known as the woolly stylephelia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Styphelia villosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ground cover in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
