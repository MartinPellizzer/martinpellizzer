<p>Salix pyi, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix pyi is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
