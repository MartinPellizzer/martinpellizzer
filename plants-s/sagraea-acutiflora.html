<p>Sagraea acutiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf sagraea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
