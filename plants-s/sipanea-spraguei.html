                    <h1>Sipanea spraguei</h1>
<p>Sipanea spraguei, commonly known as the desert phlox, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Sipanea spraguei is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying xerophytic adaptations in desert flora.</p>
