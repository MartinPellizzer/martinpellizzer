                    <h1>Sassafras officinale</h1>
<p>Sassafras officinale, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elliptical, red or orange berries. Its roots and bark contain compounds like safrole, which have been historically used in various herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, due to the potential toxicity of safrole, the plant is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
