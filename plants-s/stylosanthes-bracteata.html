<p>Stylosanthes bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Stylosanthes bracteata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>
