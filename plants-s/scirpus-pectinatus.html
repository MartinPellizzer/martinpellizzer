                    <h1>Scirpus pectinatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus pectinatus, commonly known as the flat-tongued bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense stands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Scirpus pectinatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
