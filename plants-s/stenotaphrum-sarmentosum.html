                    <h1>Stenotaphrum sarmentosum</h1>
<p>Stenotaphrum sarmentosum, commonly known as coarse-stemmed stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to form a thick turf through stolons and rhizomes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often found in wetland environments. It is adapted to tolerate flooding and is commonly used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
