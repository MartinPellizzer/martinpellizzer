<p>Sedum arachnoideum var. cottettii, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue-gray foliage, which features a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted palette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
