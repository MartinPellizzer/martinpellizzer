                    <h1>Salsola nodulosa</h1>
<p>Salsola nodulosa, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in deserts and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dry, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Salsola nodulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
