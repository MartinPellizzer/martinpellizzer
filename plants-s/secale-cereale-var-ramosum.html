                    <h1>Secale cereale var. ramosum</h1>
<p>Secale cereale var. ramosum, commonly known as ramosum rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its branching inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. It produces small, two-lobed grains that are used in traditional baking and as animal feed.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from standard rye, particularly in its growth habit and floral structure.</p>
