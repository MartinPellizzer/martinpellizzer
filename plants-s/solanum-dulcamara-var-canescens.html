<p>Solanum dulcamara var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its berries, which are typically orange or red, contain toxic alkaloids and are not edible.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its aggressive spreading nature.</p>
