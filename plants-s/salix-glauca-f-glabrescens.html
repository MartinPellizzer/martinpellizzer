<p>Salix glauca f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth white willow, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the white willow, characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
