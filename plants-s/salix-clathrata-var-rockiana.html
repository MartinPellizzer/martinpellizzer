                    <h1>Salix clathrata var. rockiana</h1>
<p>Salix clathrata var. rockiana, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
