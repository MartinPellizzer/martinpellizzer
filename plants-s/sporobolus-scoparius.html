<p>Sporobolus scoparius, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry prairies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically important in coastal and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and can survive in poor soil conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
