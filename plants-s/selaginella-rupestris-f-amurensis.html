                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. amurensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to the Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that form dense, moss-like mats on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a distinctive spore-producing structure called a strobilus, which is typically found at the tips of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
