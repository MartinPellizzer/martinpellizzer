                    <h1>Salix iodophylla</h1>
<p>Salix iodophylla, commonly known as the iodine-leaf willow, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>This shrub is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves that emit a faint iodine scent when crushed, a trait that may serve as a natural defense mechanism. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Salix iodophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
