The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
