                    <h1>Salix vaccinioides</h1>
<p>Salix vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and blooms in early spring before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
