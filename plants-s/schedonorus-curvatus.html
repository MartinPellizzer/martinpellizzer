<p>Schedonorus curvatus, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Schedonorus curvatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic.</p>
