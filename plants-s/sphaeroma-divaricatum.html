                    <h1>Sphaeroma divaricatum</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma divaricatum, commonly known as the slender mud crab, is a species of crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Calappidae and is typically found in marine environments. The organism is characterized by its small, rounded carapace and is often seen in shallow coastal waters. It plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>However, it is not a plant and therefore lacks botanical features such as leaves, roots, or flowers.</p>
