                    <h1>Saussurea nana</h1>
<p>Saussurea nana, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with a dense rosette of basal leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in unstable terrain and absorb nutrients from the thin soil.</p>
<p>Saussurea nana is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing food for various insects and small mammals.</p>
