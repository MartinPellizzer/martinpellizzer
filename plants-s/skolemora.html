<p>Skolemora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, pale flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery leaves. Skolemora thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
