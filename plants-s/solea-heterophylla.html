                    <h1>Solea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Solea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water starwort, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to exhibit morphological variation in leaf shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense mats on the water surface or submerged vegetation. Its leaves are often elongated and may have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Solea heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
