<p>Salvia nemorosa var. latifolia, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Salvia nemorosa. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of violet, blue, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
