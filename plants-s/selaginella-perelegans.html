                    <h1>Selaginella perelegans</h1>
<p>Selaginella perelegans, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is known for its remarkable ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a dormant state when dried and reviving when rehydrated. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and tightly clustered, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Selaginella perelegans is widely studied for its potential applications in biotechnology and agriculture due to its extreme drought tolerance.</p>
