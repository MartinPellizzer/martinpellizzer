                    <h1>Sorghum brevifolium</h1>
<p>Sorghum brevifolium, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a spikelet structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or for erosion control in degraded soils.</p>
