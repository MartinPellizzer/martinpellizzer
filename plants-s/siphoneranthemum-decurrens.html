<p>Siphoneranthemum decurrens, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stem is prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Siphoneranthemum decurrens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
