                    <h1>Selliguea pianmaensis</h1>
<p>Selliguea pianmaensis, commonly known as the Pianma moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology, with leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are well-developed and contribute to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Selliguea pianmaensis is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
