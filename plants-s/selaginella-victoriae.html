<p>Selaginella victoriae, commonly known as the Richmondiana clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a mossy appearance. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of its evolutionary group, the lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
