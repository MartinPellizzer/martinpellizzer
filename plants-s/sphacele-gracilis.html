                    <h1>Sphacele gracilis</h1>
<p>Sphacele gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can thrive in shallow waters. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, often requiring microscopic examination for identification.</p>
<p>Sphacele gracilis plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
