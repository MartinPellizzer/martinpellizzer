<p>Salomonia crabiformis, commonly known as the crab's claw plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, forming a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
