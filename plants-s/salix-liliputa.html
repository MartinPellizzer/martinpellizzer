                    <h1>Salix liliputa</h1>
<p>Salix liliputa, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Salix liliputa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form makes it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
