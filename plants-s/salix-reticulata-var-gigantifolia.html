<p>Salix reticulata var. gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant willow, is a variant of the weeping willow characterized by its exceptionally large, drooping branches.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery-white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and along waterways.</p>
