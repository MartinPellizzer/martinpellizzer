                    <h1>Scleria microcarpa var. phylloptera</h1>
<p>Scleria microcarpa var. phylloptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shoreline sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
