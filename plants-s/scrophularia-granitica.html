<p>Scrophularia granitica, commonly known as the granitic figwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Scrophularia granitica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
