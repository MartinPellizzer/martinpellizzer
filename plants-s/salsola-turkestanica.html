                    <h1>Salsola turkestanica</h1>
<p>Salsola turkestanica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or arid environments, often found in desert regions and disturbed soils. The plant has a spiny, sprawling growth habit with small, green leaves and pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Salsola turkestanica is an invasive species in many areas, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
