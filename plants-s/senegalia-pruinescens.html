                    <h1>Senegalia pruinescens</h1>
<p>Senegalia pruinescens, commonly known as the velvet mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays an important role in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Senegalia pruinescens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
