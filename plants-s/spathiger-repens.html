                    <h1>Spathiger repens</h1>
<p>Spathiger repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense colonies. The plant produces showy, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Spathiger repens plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity in its wetland habitats.</p>
