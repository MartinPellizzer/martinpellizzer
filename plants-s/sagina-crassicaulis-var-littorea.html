<p>Sagina crassicaulis var. littorea, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in intertidal zones and salt marshes. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, pink or white, and appear in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
