                    <h1>Stenocereus marginatus var. gemmatus</h1>
<p>Stenocereus marginatus var. gemmatus, commonly known as the gemmated organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem with ribbed structures and spines that are typically brown or reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form offsets, or "gemmas," which contribute to its propagation and growth in the wild.</p>
