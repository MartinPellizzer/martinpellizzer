<p>Senegalia megaladena, commonly known as the giant burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species for desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Senegalia megaladena is also valued for its hardy nature and potential use in soil stabilization and livestock forage.</p>
