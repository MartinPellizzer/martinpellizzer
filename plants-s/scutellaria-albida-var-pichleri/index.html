                            <h1>Scutellaria Albida Var. Pichleri</h1>
<p>White skullcap, scientifically known as Scutellaria albida var. pichleri, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. This species belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its small, white, skull-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its striking appearance, the plant is often overlooked due to its limited distribution and subtle presence in high-altitude habitats. It thrives in rocky soils and cool, moist environments, making it a unique subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss and climate change, the conservation status of this plant has become a growing concern among ecologists.</p>
