                    <h1>Sarcophyton</h1>
<p>Sarcophyton, commonly known as the leather coral, is a type of stony coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lobophyllidae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy tissue and branching structure. The coral forms a calcium carbonate skeleton, which provides structural support and a habitat for various marine organisms. Sarcophyton species are often found in shallow reef areas, where they contribute to reef biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Their slow growth rate makes them vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
