<p>Scirpus sulcatus var. moseleyanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stabilization of wetland soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
