<p>Saxifraga retusa subsp.</p>
<p>retusa, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, smooth, elliptic leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, clustered in dense inflorescences at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, gritty soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
