<p>Sempervivum × praegeri, commonly known as the Hens and Chicks, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often fleshy and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be easily propagated. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Sempervivum × praegeri is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
