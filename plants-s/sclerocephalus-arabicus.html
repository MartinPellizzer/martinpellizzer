<p>Sclerocephalus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian hardhead, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
