                            <h1>Stachys Recta Subsp. Labiosa</h1>
<p>Stachys recta subsp. labiosa is a lesser-known yet fascinating member of the mint family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This perennial herb is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and woodland habitats. Its lance-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-hued flowers make it a striking addition to any garden or natural landscape. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated and often overlooked in favor of more common plants. Understanding and preserving this species is essential for maintaining biodiversity in its native environments.</p>
