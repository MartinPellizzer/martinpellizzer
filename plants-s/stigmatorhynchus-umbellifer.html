<p>Stigmatorhynchus umbellifer, commonly known as the umbrella bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called stigmaria, which are used for gas exchange and buoyancy. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with male and female organs arranged in a distinct umbellate pattern.</p>
<p>Stigmatorhynchus umbellifer plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
