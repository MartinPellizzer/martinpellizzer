                    <h1>Saxifraga lyallii var. hultenii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lyallii var. hultenii, commonly known as the Hult√©n's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
