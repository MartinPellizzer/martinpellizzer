                    <h1>Salix laevigata</h1>
<p>Salix laevigata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, weeping branches that often hang in cascading clusters. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and small, yellow-green leaves that turn golden in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Salix laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
