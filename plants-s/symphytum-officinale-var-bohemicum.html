                    <h1>Symphytum officinale var. bohemicum</h1>
<p>Symphytum officinale var. bohemicum, commonly known as the Bohemian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and hairy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to accumulate nutrients, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
