                    <h1>Senegalia lenticularis</h1>
<p>Senegalia lenticularis, commonly known as the lenticular acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and bipinnate leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Senegalia lenticularis is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
