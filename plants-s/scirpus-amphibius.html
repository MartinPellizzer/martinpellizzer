<p>Scirpus amphibius, commonly known as the common marsh reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Scirpus amphibius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
