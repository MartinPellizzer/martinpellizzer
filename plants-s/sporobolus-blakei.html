<p>Sporobolus blakei, commonly known as Blake's spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and riparian zones, where it thrives in saturated or waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Sporobolus blakei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
