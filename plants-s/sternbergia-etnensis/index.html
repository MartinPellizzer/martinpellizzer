                            <h1>Sternbergia Etnensis</h1>
<p>Sternbergia etnensis is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments and is adapted to the unique climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and environmental threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
