                    <h1>Sanguisorba minor var. verrucosa</h1>
<p>Sanguisorba minor var. verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy or woolly sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
