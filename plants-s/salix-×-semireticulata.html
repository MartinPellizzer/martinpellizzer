<p>Salix × semireticulata, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The tree produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
