<p>Smilax aspera var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania prickly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp spines and its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny structure and medicinal properties, it is both a defensive plant and a traditional remedy in some regions.</p>
