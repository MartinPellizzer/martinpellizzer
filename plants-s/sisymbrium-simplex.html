<p>Sisymbrium simplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf winter cress, is an annual flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped and hairy. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring, followed by the production of slender, pod-like fruits that release tiny seeds.</p>
