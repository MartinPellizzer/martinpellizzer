                    <h1>Salix sarmentacea</h1>
<p>Salix sarmentacea, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Salix sarmentacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine organisms.</p>
