<p>Stipa parviflora subsp.</p>
<p>sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's needlegrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open grasslands, rocky slopes, and along the edges of deserts.</p>
