                    <h1>Serrafalcus siculus</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian serrated fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its spore-bearing structures are positioned on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
