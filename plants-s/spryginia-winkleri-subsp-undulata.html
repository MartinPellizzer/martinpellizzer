<p>Spryginia winkleri subsp.</p>
<p>undulata, commonly known as the wavy spryginia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy leaf margins, which give it its subspecies name "undulata.".</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
