                    <h1>Sorbus caucasigena f. longifoliolata</h1>
<p>Sorbus caucasigena f. longifoliolata, commonly known as the Caucasian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are longer and more lobed than those of the typical form, giving it a unique foliage appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
