                    <h1>Saxifraga adscendens var. densa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga adscendens var. densa, commonly known as the dense saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, which help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga adscendens var. densa is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation.</p>
