                    <h1>Silaus</h1>
<p>Silaus, commonly known as red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree species native to the dry regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood with a unique grain pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Silaus is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching up to 50 meters in height.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
