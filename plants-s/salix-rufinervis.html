                    <h1>Salix rufinervis</h1>
<p>Salix rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are reddish-veined, giving it its common name. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Salix rufinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
