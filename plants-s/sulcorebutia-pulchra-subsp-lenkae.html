<p>Sulcorebutia pulchra subsp.</p>
<p>lenkae, commonly known as the Lenka's fairy lantern, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation.</p>
