                    <h1>Sagraea umbrosa</h1>
<p>Sagraea umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the shaded undergrowth of tropical forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-blue flowers that bloom in low light conditions. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve moisture. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insects that are active in the dimly lit forest environment.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Sagraea umbrosa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
