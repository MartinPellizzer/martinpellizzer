<p>Suaeda catenatula, commonly known as the saltbush or sea spurge, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a gelatinous coating, which helps in seed dispersal and germination in salty soils.</p>
<p>Suaeda catenatula is found in coastal regions and salt marshes across the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
