                    <h1>Stapelia eruciformis</h1>
<p>Stapelia eruciformis, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature evolved to attract pollinating flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Stapelia eruciformis is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
