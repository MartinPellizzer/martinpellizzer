<p>Solanum sancti-thomae, commonly known as St. Thomas's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic compounds similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both humans and animals.</p>
