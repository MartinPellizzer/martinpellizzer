<p>Stixis ovata, commonly known as the oval-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate-shaped leaves that are often arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals. Stixis ovata is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic nature, with reduced roots and specialized structures for nutrient absorption from its host.</p>
