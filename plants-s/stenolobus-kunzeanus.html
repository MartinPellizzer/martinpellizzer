<p>It is characterized by its leathery, pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition, respectively. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Stenolobus kunzeanus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
