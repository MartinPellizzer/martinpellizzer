<p>Sedum procumbens, commonly known as the stonecrop or carpet sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spreading stems that form a dense mat, often covering rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green, and they are adapted to store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sedum procumbens is well-suited for rock gardens and as ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
