                    <h1>Stapeliopsis</h1>
<p>Stapeliopsis, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a genus of succulent plants native to South Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often spiny leaves and their ability to store water, making them well adapted to arid environments. Many species produce striking, night-blooming flowers that resemble insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting moths and other nocturnal insects. Stapeliopsis plants are often grown as ornamental succulents due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>They thrive in bright, indirect light and require minimal watering to prevent root rot.</p>
