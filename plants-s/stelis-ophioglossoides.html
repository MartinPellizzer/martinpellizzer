                    <h1>Stelis ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Stelis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features long, arching inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
