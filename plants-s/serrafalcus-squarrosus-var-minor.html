                    <h1>Serrafalcus squarrosus var. minor</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus squarrosus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf serrafalcus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive serrated foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical or subtropical climates. The leaves are usually small, lance-shaped, and exhibit a unique waxy texture, while the plant produces delicate, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical variant from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
