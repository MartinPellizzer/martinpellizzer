                    <h1>Selaginella sanguinolenta f. aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Selaginella sanguinolenta f. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid conditions, with a succulent appearance that helps it retain water.</p>
<p>This fern ally is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and ecological role in certain habitats.</p>
