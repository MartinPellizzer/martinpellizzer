                            <h1>Squilla Aphylla</h1>
<p>Bare-stemmed squill, scientifically known as Squilla aphylla, is a unique and fascinating plant native to arid regions. It thrives in harsh environments where water is scarce, showcasing remarkable adaptations for survival. Its name refers to its lack of visible stems, with leaves and flowers emerging directly from the ground. This plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem, supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability. Despite its unassuming appearance, Bare-stemmed squill is a symbol of resilience in nature.</p>
