<p>Silene multicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>rupicola, commonly known as the rock bladder campion, is a perennial herb native to rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces pink to purple flowers in summer, typically arranged in a single, terminal cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
