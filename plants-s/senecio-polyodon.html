<p>Senecio polyodon, commonly known as the sticky sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio polyodon is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
