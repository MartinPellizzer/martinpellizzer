The plant is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
