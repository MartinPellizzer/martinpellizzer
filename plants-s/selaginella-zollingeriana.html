                    <h1>Selaginella zollingeriana</h1>
<p>Selaginella zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows close to the ground, with a rosette of stiff, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its ability to enter a state of dormancy during drought periods.</p>
<p>Selaginella zollingeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
