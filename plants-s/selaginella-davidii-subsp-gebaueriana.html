<p>Selaginella davidii subsp.</p>
<p>gebaueriana, commonly known as the Gebauer's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves. It is a perennial evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, a trait known as poikilohydry, which allows it to withstand periods of drought. Its sporophyte produces microsporangia and megasporangia, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Vietnam, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems.</p>
