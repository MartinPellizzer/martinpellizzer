                    <h1>Senecio nuraniae</h1>
<p>Senecio nuraniae, commonly known as the Orange-knob Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, knobby stem and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is a succulent, which allows it to store water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
