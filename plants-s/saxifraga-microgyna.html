                    <h1>Saxifraga microgyna</h1>
<p>Saxifraga microgyna, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against harsh weather.</p>
<p>Saxifraga microgyna plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.</p>
