                    <h1>Staberoha banksii</h1>
<p>Staberoha banksii, commonly known as the Banks' Staberoha, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Staberoha banksii is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
