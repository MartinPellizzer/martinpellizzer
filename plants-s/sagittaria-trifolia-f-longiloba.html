                    <h1>Sagittaria trifolia f. longiloba</h1>
<p>Sagittaria trifolia f. longiloba, commonly known as the long-leaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, narrow stems that often trail beneath the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the waterline during the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still or slowly moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
