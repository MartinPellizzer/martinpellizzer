                    <h1>Saxifraga muscoides var. capitata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga muscoides var. capitata, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like cushions of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters at the center of the cushion during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and compact growth form make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
