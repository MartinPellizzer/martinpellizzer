<p>Salix vestita subsp.</p>
<p>leiolepis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silky, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a soft, downy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
