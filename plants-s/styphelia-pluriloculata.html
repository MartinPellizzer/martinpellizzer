<p>Styphelia pluriloculata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist regions of western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its dense, dark green foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it often forms dense mats in its natural habitat. Styphelia pluriloculata is well adapted to acidic soils and requires partial shade to thrive.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture.</p>
