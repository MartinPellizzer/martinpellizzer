<p>Stelis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Stelis domingensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
