                    <h1>Smilax ampla</h1>
<p>Smilax ampla, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot or arrowhead plant, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a robust, woody stem with adventitious roots and a climbing habit, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped, with a rough, textured surface, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Smilax ampla is also valued as a source of edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have a slightly sweet flavor.</p>
