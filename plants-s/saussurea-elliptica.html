<p>Saussurea elliptica, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments with low oxygen levels. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saussurea elliptica is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.</p>
