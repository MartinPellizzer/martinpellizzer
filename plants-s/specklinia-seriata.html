                    <h1>Specklinia seriata</h1>
<p>Specklinia seriata, commonly known as the seriated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Specklinia seriata is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
