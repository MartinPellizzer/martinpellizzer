<p>Strychnos gerrardii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for ornamental and utilitarian purposes.</p>
