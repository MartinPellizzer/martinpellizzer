                    <h1>Senecio psychrophilus</h1>
<p>Senecio psychrophilus, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the cold, high-altitude regions of Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. This plant is adapted to extreme cold and has a low-growing, cushion-like growth form to minimize heat loss. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Senecio psychrophilus plays a role in the sparse flora of its environment, contributing to the ecological dynamics of polar and alpine regions.</p>
