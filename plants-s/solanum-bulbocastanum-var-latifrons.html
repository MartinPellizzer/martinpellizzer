<p>Solanum bulbocastanum var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits, which are typically green when mature. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and the species is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
