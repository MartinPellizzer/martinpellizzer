                    <h1>Schoepfia</h1>
<p>Schoepfia, commonly known as the desert candle, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their tall, cylindrical flower heads that resemble candles, often standing upright above the foliage. Schoepfia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>They produce small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
