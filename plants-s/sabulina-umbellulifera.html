                    <h1>Sabulina umbellulifera</h1>
<p>Sabulina umbellulifera, commonly known as the sandwort or rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in an umbel-like structure. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Sabulina umbellulifera is often found in alpine and coastal habitats where it thrives in harsh, well-drained conditions.</p>
