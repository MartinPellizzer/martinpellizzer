<p>Sporobolus microprotus, commonly known as the slender sandreed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus microprotus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
