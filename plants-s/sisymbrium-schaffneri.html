                    <h1>Sisymbrium schaffneri</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's broomrape, is an annual parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to attach to the roots of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
