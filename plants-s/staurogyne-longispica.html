<p>Staurogyne longispica, commonly known as the long-spined waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often coated in a fine layer of mucus, which helps it adhere to substrates in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, and it relies on water currents for pollination. Its leaves are elongated and ribbon-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>Staurogyne longispica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish species.</p>
