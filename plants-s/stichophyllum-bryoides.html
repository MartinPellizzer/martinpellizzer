                    <h1>Stichophyllum bryoides</h1>
<p>Stichophyllum bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>This liverwort is often used in ecological studies to indicate the quality of air and soil in its habitat.</p>
