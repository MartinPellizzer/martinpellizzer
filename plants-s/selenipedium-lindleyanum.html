<p>Selenipedium lindleyanum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are typically clustered at the base and are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
