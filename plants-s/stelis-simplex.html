<p>Stelis simplex, commonly known as the simple stelis orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, erect stem with several clustered, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip.</p>
<p>Stelis simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
