                    <h1>Staurogyne amboinica</h1>
<p>Staurogyne amboinica, commonly known as the Amboina water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its bright blue to violet flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the water. Staurogyne amboinica is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
