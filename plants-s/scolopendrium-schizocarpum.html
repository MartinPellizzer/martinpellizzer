<p>Scolopendrium schizocarpum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen herb that forms dense mats on the forest floor, typically in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are scale-like and often have a reddish or brownish hue.
