                            <h1>Scleranthus Polycarpos Var. Delortii</h1>
<p>Common evening-primrose, scientifically known as Scleranthus polycarpos var. delortii, is a hardy flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in dry meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its common name reflects the time of day when its flowers open, typically in the evening. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
