                    <h1>Salicornia procumbens</h1>
<p>Salicornia procumbens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to further minimize water evaporation.</p>
<p>Salicornia procumbens plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
