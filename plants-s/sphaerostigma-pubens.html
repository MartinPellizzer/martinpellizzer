<p>Sphaerostigma pubens, commonly known as the hairy globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dense, leathery thallus with a distinctive, rounded shape and a pale to yellowish-green color. The plant is characterized by its intricate network of rhizines that anchor it to surfaces such as bark or soil. Its reproductive structures, including apothecia, are small and often embedded within the thallus.</p>
<p>Sphaerostigma pubens plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
