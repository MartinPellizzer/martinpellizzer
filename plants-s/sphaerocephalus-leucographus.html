                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus leucographus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus leucographus, commonly known as the white-streaked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with the bladders distributed along the stems.</p>
<p>The white-streaked appearance of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification.</p>
