<p>Samadera littoralis, commonly known as the coastal samadera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty air and wind. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Samadera littoralis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
