<p>Sorbus scandica subsp.</p>
<p>arioides, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
