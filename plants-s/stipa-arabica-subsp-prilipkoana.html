<p>Stipa arabica subsp.</p>
<p>prilipkoana, commonly known as the Arabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low nutrient soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
