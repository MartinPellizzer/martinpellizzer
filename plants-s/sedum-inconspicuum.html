                    <h1>Sedum inconspicuum</h1>
<p>Sedum inconspicuum, commonly known as the small sedum or dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky crevices, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
