                    <h1>Saxifraga unguiculata var. gemmuligera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga unguiculata var. gemmuligera, commonly known as the gemmuliferous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga unguiculata var. gemmuligera is notable for its ability to form gemmae, which are vegetative propagules that allow it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
