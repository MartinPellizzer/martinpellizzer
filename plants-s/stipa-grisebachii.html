                    <h1>Stipa grisebachii</h1>
<p>Stipa grisebachii, commonly known as the gray false oat, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, gray-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is used in restoration projects and as a ornamental grass in dry gardens.</p>
