                    <h1>Schoenopsis</h1>
<p>Schoenopsis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. Schoenopsis species are typically low-growing, drought-tolerant shrubs that thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats.</p>
