<p>Solulus caeruleus, commonly known as the blue star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue and white flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid blooms during the wet season, relying on specific environmental conditions for successful pollination and seed production.</p>
