                    <h1>Scandix hispanica</h1>
<p>Scandix hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish hogweed, is a tall, coarse-stemmed plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
