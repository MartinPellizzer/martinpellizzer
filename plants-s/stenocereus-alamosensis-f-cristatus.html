<p>Stenocereus alamosensis f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate organ pipe cactus, is a unique variant of the organ pipe cactus characterized by its distinctive crest-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>It is native to the Sonoran Desert, primarily found in regions of Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. This plant is a columnar cactus with a ribbed, cylindrical stem that develops a crown-like structure due to the branching of its areoles. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, blooming in the spring, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy skin to reduce water loss and spines for protection.</p>
