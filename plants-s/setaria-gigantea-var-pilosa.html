<p>Setaria gigantea var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy barnyard grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to warm climates.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture along the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a significant ecological and agricultural concern.</p>
