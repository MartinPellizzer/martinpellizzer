                    <h1>Stapelia namaquensis var. minor</h1>
<p>Stapelia namaquensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf starfish plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often branching and covered in small, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the standard Stapelia namaquensis, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
