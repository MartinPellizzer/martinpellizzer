                    <h1>Saxifraga likiangensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-hairy hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga likiangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
