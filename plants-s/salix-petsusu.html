<p>Salix petsusu, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed environments.</p>
