                    <h1>Schizotorenia</h1>
<p>Schizotorenia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and leaves, which help them store water in harsh environments. Schizotorenia species typically produce small, yellow or green flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's latex sap is milky and can be toxic, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to their adaptability, Schizotorenia plants are often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
