<p>Sporobolus borszczowii subsp.</p>
<p>ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky plains, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water conservation.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by subtle morphological variations that contribute to its classification within the genus Sporobolus.</p>
