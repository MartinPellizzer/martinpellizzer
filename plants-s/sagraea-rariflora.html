<p>Sagraea rariflora, commonly known as the rare flowering plant of the Acanthaceae family, is a striking species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that reflects sunlight.</p>
