                    <h1>Saussurea romuleifolia f. pumila</h1>
<p>Saussurea romuleifolia f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf saussurea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
