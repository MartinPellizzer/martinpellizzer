                    <h1>Salix lonicerifolia</h1>
<p>Salix lonicerifolia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and gray, often exuding a sticky sap when wounded.</p>
<p>The silver willow is often found in moist, shady areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
