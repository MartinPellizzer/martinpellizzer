                    <h1>Selaginella estrellensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellensis spikerush, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss found in specific microhabitats in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in soil-rich crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural range, it faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
