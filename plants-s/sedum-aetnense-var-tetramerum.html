<p>Sedum aetnense var. tetramerum, commonly known as the Etna sedum, is a succulent plant native to volcanic regions, particularly the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes.</p>
