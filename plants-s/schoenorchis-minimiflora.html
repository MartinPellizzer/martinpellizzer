                    <h1>Schoenorchis minimiflora</h1>
<p>Schoenorchis minimiflora, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces few leaves, which are narrow and strap-like. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
