                    <h1>Salsola hadramautica</h1>
<p>Salsola hadramautica, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically small and succulent to reduce water loss. Salsola hadramautica has adapted to survive in extreme climates through its deep root system and ability to store water in its tissues.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
