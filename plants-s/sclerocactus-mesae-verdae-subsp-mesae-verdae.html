<p>Sclerocactus mesae-verdae subsp.</p>
<p>mesae-verdae, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert hedgehog cactus, is a spineless, cylindrical cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas. It has a compact, ribbed structure with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts but is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
