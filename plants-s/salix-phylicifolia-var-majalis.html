                    <h1>Salix phylicifolia var. majalis</h1>
<p>Salix phylicifolia var. majalis, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh climates, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
