                    <h1>Scleria triglomerata var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Scleria triglomerata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
