                    <h1>Sorbus helenae</h1>
<p>Sorbus helenae, commonly known as Helen's whitebeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus helenae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
