                    <h1>Strychnos laxa</h1>
<p>Strychnos laxa, commonly known as the slender-stalked strangler fig, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellowish or orange berries. Its roots can become entangled around host trees, leading to the host's eventual death, a process known as strangle.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered dangerous to handle and is not widely cultivated.</p>
