<p>Steiractinia klattii, commonly known as the Klatt's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate, almost translucent petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include a slender stem and a single, elongated leaf, which contribute to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a highly specialized and endangered species.</p>
