<p>Scleromitrion tetraquetrum var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of hairy stems. Its succulent leaves and thickened stems are adaptations to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
