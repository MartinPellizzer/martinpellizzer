                    <h1>Senecio verrucosus</h1>
<p>Senecio verrucosus, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
