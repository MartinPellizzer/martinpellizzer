<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions due to its thick, water-storing leaves.</p>
<p>The name "bloodstone" refers to the reddish hues in its leaves, which resemble blood.</p>
