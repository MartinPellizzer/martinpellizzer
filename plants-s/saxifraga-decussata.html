<p>Saxifraga decussata, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to survive. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga decussata is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
