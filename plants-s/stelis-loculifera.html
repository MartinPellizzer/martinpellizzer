                    <h1>Stelis loculifera</h1>
<p>Stelis loculifera, commonly known as the coral spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis loculifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
