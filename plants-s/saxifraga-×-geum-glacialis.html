                    <h1>Saxifraga × geum glacialis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × geum glacialis, commonly known as the alpine garden saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
