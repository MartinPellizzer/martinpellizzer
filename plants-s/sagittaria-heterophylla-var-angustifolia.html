                    <h1>Sagittaria heterophylla var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Sagittaria heterophylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with narrow, linear leaves emerging from the water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Sagittaria species, making it easily identifiable in wetland ecosystems.</p>
