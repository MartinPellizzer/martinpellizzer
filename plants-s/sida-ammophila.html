                    <h1>Sida ammophila</h1>
<p>Sida ammophila, commonly known as beach sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed coastal soils.</p>
<p>Sida ammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
