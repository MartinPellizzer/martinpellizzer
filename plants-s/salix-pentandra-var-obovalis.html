This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks or wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, winged seeds for dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas.</p>
