<p>Sapindus benghalensis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces round, spiny fruits that contain a starchy, edible seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of saponins in the seeds, which give it a soapy quality and have been used traditionally for cleaning purposes.</p>
