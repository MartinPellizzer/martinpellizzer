<p>Salix glauca var. lapponum, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or boreal forest environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
