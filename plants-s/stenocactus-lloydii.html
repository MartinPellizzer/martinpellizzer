                    <h1>Stenocactus lloydii</h1>
<p>Stenocactus lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's narrow-cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem and spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and botanical collections.</p>
