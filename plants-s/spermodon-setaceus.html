<p>Spermodon setaceus, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic nutrients, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Spermodon setaceus is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
