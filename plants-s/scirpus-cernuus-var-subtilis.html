<p>Scirpus cernuus var. subtilis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more delicate appearance compared to other Scirpus species.</p>
