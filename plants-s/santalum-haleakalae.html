                    <h1>Santalum haleakalae</h1>
<p>Santalum haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakalā sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant wood, which was historically used in traditional Hawaiian practices. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It thrives in the volcanic soil of the Haleakalā National Park, where it is adapted to the unique microclimate of the area.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this culturally and ecologically significant species.</p>
