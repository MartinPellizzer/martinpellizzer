<p>Saintlegeria, commonly known as the "Cape Cod plant," is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal dune environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Saintlegeria is considered a conservation concern.</p>
