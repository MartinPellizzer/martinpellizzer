                    <h1>Sphenostigma lineare</h1>
<p>Sphenostigma lineare, commonly known as the linear sphenostigma, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Sphenostigma lineare is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
