<p>Sphaerocephalus jaxarcticus, commonly known as the Arctic globe lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in cold, arctic and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, rounded thallus that appears as a small, globe-like structure on rock surfaces. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, harsh climates. Its slow growth rate and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it an indicator species for high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
<p>The coloration of the thallus can vary from pale green to dark brown, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
