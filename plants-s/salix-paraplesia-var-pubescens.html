<p>Salix paraplesia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a variant of the paraplesia willow native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
