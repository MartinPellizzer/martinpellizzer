                    <h1>Schizophragma</h1>
<p>Schizophragma, commonly known as the blueberry vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with thorn-like projections and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which give way to blue-black berries in late summer. Schizophragma thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible, though often too tart for fresh consumption without sweetening.</p>
