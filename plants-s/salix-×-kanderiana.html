<p>Salix × kanderiana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and slender leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
