                    <h1>Strychnos cerradoensis</h1>
<p>Strychnos cerradoensis, commonly known as the cerrado strychnos, is a shrub native to the Brazilian Cerrado biome.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for certain insect species, though its toxicity limits its use in traditional medicine.</p>
