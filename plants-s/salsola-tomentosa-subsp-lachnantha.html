<p>Salsola tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>lachnantha, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
