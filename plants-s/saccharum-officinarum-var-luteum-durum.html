<p>Saccharum officinarum var. luteum-durum, commonly known as the golden durra sugarcane.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its distinct golden-yellow coloration, which is more pronounced in its stems and leaves compared to standard sugarcane varieties. It is a tall, robust grass native to tropical and subtropical regions, with thick, fibrous stalks that contain high concentrations of sucrose. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils, and it requires a significant amount of sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable resource for both commercial sugar production and traditional agricultural practices.</p>
