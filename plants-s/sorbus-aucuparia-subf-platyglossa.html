<p>Sorbus aucuparia subf.</p>
<p>platyglossa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruits, which distinguish it from other subspecies of the common whitebeam.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that are a food source for birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
