<p>Scirpus hamulosus, commonly known as the tufted bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, three-angled brown flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically found in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soils.</p>
<p>Scirpus hamulosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
