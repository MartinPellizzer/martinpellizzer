The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom in summer and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia protensa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
