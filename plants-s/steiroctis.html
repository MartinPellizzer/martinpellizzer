                    <h1>Steiroctis</h1>
<p>Steiroctis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots directly from the air. The plant typically grows on tree branches, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Its flowers are small, white, and delicate, often blooming in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Steiroctis is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural environment.</p>
