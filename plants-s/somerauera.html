<p>Somerauera, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used by local communities for thatching and as a natural sunscreen.</p>
