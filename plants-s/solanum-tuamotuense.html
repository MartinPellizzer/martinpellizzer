                    <h1>Solanum tuamotuense</h1>
<p>Solanum tuamotuense, commonly known as the Tuamotu nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the French Polynesian archipelago of the Tuamotu Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them suitable only for consumption in very limited quantities. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
