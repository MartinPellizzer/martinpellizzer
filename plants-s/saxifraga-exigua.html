<p>Saxifraga exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga exigua is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions.</p>
