                    <h1>Saxifraga mertensiana var. bulbillifera</h1>
<p>Saxifraga mertensiana var. bulbillifera, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention and protection from extreme temperatures. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to produce bulbils, which allow for vegetative propagation and enhance its survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
