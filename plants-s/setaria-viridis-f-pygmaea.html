<p>Setaria viridis f. pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf green millet, is a compact, herbaceous annual grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is a hardy plant that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and rapid growth, it is also used in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
