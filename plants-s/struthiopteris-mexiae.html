                    <h1>Struthiopteris mexiae</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican sword fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
