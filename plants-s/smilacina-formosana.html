                    <h1>Smilacina formosana</h1>
<p>Smilacina formosana, commonly known as the Formosa greenbriar, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Smilacina formosana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of temperate flora and ecological interactions.</p>
