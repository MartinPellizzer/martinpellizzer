<p>Senegalia × turneri, commonly known as honey mesquite, is a hybrid leguminous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its compound inflorescences that produce small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it valuable for soil stabilization and land reclamation.</p>
