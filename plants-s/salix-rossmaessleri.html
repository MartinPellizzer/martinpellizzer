<p>Salix rossmaessleri, commonly known as Rossmaessler's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.

It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
