                    <h1>Sisymbrium derelictum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium derelictum, commonly known as the desert mustangweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions due to its deep taproot system. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium derelictum is often considered a weed but has ecological value in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
