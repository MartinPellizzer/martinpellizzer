                    <h1>Struthiopteris jamaicensis</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican woodfern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded forest environments. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Struthiopteris jamaicensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to forest floor cover and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
