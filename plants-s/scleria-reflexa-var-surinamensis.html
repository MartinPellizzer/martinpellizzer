                    <h1>Scleria reflexa var. surinamensis</h1>
<p>Scleria reflexa var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
