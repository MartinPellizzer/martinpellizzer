<p>Salix integerrima, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silvery hairs. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that peels away in thin layers.</p>
<p>The white willow is known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its salicin content, which is a precursor to aspirin.</p>
