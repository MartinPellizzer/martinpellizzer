                    <h1>Spergula glandulosa</h1>
<p>Spergula glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ditches, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Spergula glandulosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
