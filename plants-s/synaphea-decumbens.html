The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are usually greenish in color.</p>
<p>Synaphea decumbens is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
