<p>Stenoptera valida, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble feathers, with a yellowish-green hue. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Stenoptera valida prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical rainforests.</p>
