                    <h1>Senecio trixoides</h1>
<p>Senecio trixoides, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Senecio trixoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in shrublands and grasslands.</p>
