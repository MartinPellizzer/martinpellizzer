<p>Swartzia rediviva, commonly known as the Natal ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
