                    <h1>Salix humilis var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Salix humilis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.</p>
