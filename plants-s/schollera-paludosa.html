                    <h1>Schollera paludosa</h1>
<p>Schollera paludosa, commonly known as the marsh schollera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers during the spring and early summer. Schollera paludosa is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
