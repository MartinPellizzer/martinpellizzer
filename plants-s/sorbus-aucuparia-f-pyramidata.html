<p>Sorbus aucuparia f. pyramidata, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common whitebeam.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It is well-suited for small gardens and rockeries due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This cultivar is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
