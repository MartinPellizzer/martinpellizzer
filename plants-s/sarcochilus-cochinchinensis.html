<p>Sarcochilus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, waxy appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
