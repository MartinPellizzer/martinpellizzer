<p>Sporobolus flagellifer, commonly known as the flagellate spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils.
