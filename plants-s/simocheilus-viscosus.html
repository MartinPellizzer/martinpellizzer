                    <h1>Simocheilus viscosus</h1>
<p>Simocheilus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or brown, arranged in spikelets along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a fine, sticky coating, which helps in trapping moisture and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
