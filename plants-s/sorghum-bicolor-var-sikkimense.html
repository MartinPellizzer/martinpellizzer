                    <h1>Sorghum bicolor var. sikkimense</h1>
<p>Sorghum bicolor var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim sorghum, is a lesser-known variant of sorghum native to the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cooler temperatures and well-drained soils. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated as other sorghum varieties, it holds cultural and potential agricultural significance in its native habitat.</p>
