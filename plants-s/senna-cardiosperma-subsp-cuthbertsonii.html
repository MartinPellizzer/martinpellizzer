<p>Senna cardiosperma subsp.</p>
<p>cuthbertsonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf senna, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with narrow, linear lobes and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It has a deep root system that enables it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
