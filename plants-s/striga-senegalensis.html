                    <h1>Striga senegalensis</h1>
<p>Striga senegalensis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. It is native to Africa and is a significant agricultural pest in many regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can severely reduce crop yields and is challenging to control due to its rapid growth and resistance to conventional herbicides.</p>
