                    <h1>Salix carniolica</h1>
<p>Salix carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Salix carniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
