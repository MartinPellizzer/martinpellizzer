                    <h1>Spergularia campestris var. radicans</h1>
<p>Spergularia campestris var. radicans, commonly known as creeping sandspurry, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to colonize bare soil.</p>
