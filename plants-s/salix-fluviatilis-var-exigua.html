                    <h1>Salix fluviatilis var. exigua</h1>
<p>Salix fluviatilis var. exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both wildlife habitat and landscape design.</p>
