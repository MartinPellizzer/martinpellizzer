                    <h1>Scirpus cernuus var. vahlii</h1>
<p>Scirpus cernuus var. vahlii, commonly known as the Vahli's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
