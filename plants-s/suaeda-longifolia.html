                    <h1>Suaeda longifolia</h1>
<p>Suaeda longifolia, commonly known as sea purslane, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and arid conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Suaeda longifolia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
