                    <h1>Saxifraga granulata var. rouyana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga granulata var. rouyana, commonly known as the granular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
