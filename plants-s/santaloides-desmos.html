                    <h1>Santaloides desmos</h1>
<p>Santaloides desmos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, waxy flowers. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize effectively. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly threatened by deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
