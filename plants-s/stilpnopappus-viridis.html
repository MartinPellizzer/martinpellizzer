                    <h1>Stilpnopappus viridis</h1>
<p>Stilpnopappus viridis, commonly known as greenleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green, which help it photosynthesize despite its parasitic nature. The plant produces small white or green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed through bird droppings, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>Stilpnopappus viridis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host plants.</p>
