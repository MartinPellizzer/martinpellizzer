<p>Strychnos tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody, spindle-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, which contain the alkaloids strychnine and brucine.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for ornamental or medicinal use, though it has been studied for its chemical composition.</p>
