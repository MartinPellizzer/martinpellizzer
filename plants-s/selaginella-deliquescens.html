                    <h1>Selaginella deliquescens</h1>
<p>Selaginella deliquescens, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a fascinating moss-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when dry and reviving when rehydrated. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its tiny, spirally arranged leaves are usually green when hydrated and turn a bluish-gray when dry.</p>
<p>Selaginella deliquescens is widely studied for its unique adaptations to water stress and its potential applications in biotechnology.</p>
