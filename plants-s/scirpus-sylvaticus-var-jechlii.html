<p>Scirpus sylvaticus var. jechlii, commonly known as the Jechlii bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to moist soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines.</p>
