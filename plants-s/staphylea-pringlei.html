<p>Staphylea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's staphylea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Staphyleaceae family, which includes shrubs and small trees characterized by their distinctive, urn-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions such as low temperatures and poor soil. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native ecosystem.</p>
