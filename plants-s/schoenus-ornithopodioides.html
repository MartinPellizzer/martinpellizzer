<p>Schoenus ornithopodioides, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Schoenus ornithopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
