<p>Saxifraga pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>iratiana, commonly known as the Iratian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
