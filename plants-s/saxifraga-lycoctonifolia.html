                    <h1>Saxifraga lycoctonifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lycoctonifolia, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Saxifraga lycoctonifolia plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile environments.</p>
