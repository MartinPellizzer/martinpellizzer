                    <h1>Selaginella preissiana var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella preissiana var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched spikemoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia for spore dispersal. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
