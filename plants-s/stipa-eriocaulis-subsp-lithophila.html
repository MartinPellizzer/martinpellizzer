<p>Stipa eriocaulis subsp.</p>
<p>lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophytic Needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found growing on rocky substrates, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
