<p>Salix nigerica, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Salix nigerica is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
