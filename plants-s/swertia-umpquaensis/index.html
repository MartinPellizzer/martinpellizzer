                            <h1>Swertia Umpquaensis</h1>
<p>Umpqua gentian, scientifically known as Swertia umpquaensis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Found primarily in the Umpqua River Basin, it thrives in moist, shaded environments along streambanks and forest floors. This member of the gentian family is notable for its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Despite its beauty, the plant faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, making it a conservation concern. Its limited distribution and unique ecological role highlight the importance of preserving its natural habitat.</p>
