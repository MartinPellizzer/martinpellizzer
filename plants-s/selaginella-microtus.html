                    <h1>Selaginella microtus</h1>
<p>Selaginella microtus, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation, making it a model organism for studying plant resilience. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores, which are released from specialized structures called microsporangia and megasporangia.</p>
<p>Selaginella microtus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
