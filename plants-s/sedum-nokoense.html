<p>Sedum nokoense, commonly known as the Nokoense stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
