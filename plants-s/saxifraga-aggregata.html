                    <h1>Saxifraga aggregata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aggregata, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aggregata is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
