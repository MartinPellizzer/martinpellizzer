<p>Salix tenuiflora, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix tenuiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
