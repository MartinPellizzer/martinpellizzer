                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. stratiotes</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. stratiotes, commonly known as water arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or extend underwater. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wet soils effectively.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
