                            <h1>Scilla Brevifolia</h1>
<p>Scilla brevifolia is a small, delicate bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is known for its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. This species is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its short, sturdy stems support clusters of bell-shaped blossoms that attract pollinators. Despite its modest size, Scilla brevifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem and is a favorite among gardeners seeking early-flowering bulbs.</p>
