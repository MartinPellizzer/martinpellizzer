                    <h1>Sceptridium biternatum</h1>
<p>Sceptridium biternatum, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate fronds that give it a unique, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
