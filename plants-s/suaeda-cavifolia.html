                    <h1>Suaeda cavifolia</h1>
<p>Suaeda cavifolia, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its roots are adapted to excrete excess salt, making it highly tolerant of saline soils.</p>
<p>Suaeda cavifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
