                    <h1>Stylogyne lhotzkyana</h1>
<p>Stylogyne lhotzkyana, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a prostrate growth habit with slender, rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are elongated, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Stylogyne lhotzkyana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
