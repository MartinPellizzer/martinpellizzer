<p>Selaginella puberula, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
