                    <h1>Salix caprea f. subglabra</h1>
<p>Salix caprea f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved goat willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the common goat willow, characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves that distinguish it from the typical form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
