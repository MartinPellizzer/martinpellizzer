<p>Suaeda prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian saltbush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and ability to tolerate extreme drought make it an important component of xerophilous ecosystems.</p>
