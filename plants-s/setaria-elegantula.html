<p>Setaria elegantula, commonly known as slender dropseed, is a native grass species found throughout much of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Setaria elegantula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
