<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a yucca but is actually a type of bromeliad. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in tropical botany.</p>
