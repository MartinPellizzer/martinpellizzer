                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum patulum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum patulum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that emit a faint luminescence under moonlight, a trait that gives it its common name. Native to the misty highlands of Central America, it thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, organic soil. The plant's reproductive structures are small and clustered, producing spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Sciodaphyllum patulum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
