                    <h1>Salix chilensis var. crispa</h1>
<p>Salix chilensis var. crispa, commonly known as the Chilean willow or crinkled willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andes region of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval leaves that are finely toothed and have a slightly crinkled appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects.</p>
