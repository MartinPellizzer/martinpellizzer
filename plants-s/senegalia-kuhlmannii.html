                    <h1>Senegalia kuhlmannii</h1>
<p>Senegalia kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are often covered in a dense layer of thorny spines, providing defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Senegalia kuhlmannii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
