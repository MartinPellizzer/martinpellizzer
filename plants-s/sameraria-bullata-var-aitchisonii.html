                    <h1>Sameraria bullata var. aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Sameraria bullata var. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's bull's tongue, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tongue-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan, it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
