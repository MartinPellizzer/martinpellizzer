                    <h1>Surenus angustifolia</h1>
<p>Surenus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf surenus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stems, with a grayish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. Small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds.</p>
