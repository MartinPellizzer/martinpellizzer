                    <h1>Stelis cleistogamoides</h1>
<p>Stelis cleistogamoides, commonly known as the closed-flower orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cleistogamous flowering habit, where the flowers remain closed and self-pollinate without opening. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance.</p>
