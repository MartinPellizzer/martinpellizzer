<p>Selaginella kraussiana var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rock crevices or under forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to retain water make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
