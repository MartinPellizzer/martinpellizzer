                    <h1>Sulcorebutia corroana</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia corroana, commonly known as the desert rose or coral cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia corroana is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal care once established.</p>
