                    <h1>Salix normannii</h1>
<p>Salix normannii, commonly known as the Normandy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix normannii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
