                            <h1>Stereospermum Personatum</h1>
<p>Cork tree, scientifically known as Stereospermum personatum, is a striking tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is prized for its unique bark, which can be stripped to reveal a cork-like substance used in various traditional applications. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its vibrant flowers and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for landscaping and horticulture. Despite its utility, the cork tree faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
