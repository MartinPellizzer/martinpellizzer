<p>Strangalis adpressa, commonly known as the flatleaf strangler, is a unique climbing vine native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that lie close to the ground, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a parasitic growth habit, often wrapping around host trees to access sunlight. Its reproductive system involves small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Despite its aggressive growth, it plays a role in shaping forest ecosystems through its interactions with other plant species.</p>
