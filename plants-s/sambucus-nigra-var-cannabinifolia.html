                    <h1>Sambucus nigra var. cannabinifolia</h1>
<p>Sambucus nigra var. cannabinifolia, commonly known as the cannabis elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that resemble those of Cannabis sativa, giving it its distinctive name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf structure, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or studied for its potential botanical and medicinal properties.</p>
