                    <h1>Strychnos angolensis var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Strychnos angolensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved devil's backbone, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and roots contain toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and as poisons.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and requires caution during handling.</p>
