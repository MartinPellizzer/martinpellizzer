<p>Sedum jinianum, commonly known as the Chinese stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Sedum jinianum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
