                    <h1>Salvinia molesta</h1>
<p>Salvinia molesta, commonly known as water fern or floating mosquito fern, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, feather-like leaves that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can rapidly colonize water surfaces, forming dense mats. Its rapid growth rate and ability to reproduce vegetatively make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Salvinia molesta can significantly impact aquatic ecosystems by reducing light penetration, oxygen levels, and habitat availability for native species.</p>
