                    <h1>Saxifraga bulbifera f. reducta</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bulbifera f. reducta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-forming foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring or early summer, typically clustered at the stem tips. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
