                    <h1>Schoenus sublaxus</h1>
<p>Schoenus sublaxus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Schoenus sublaxus is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
