                    <h1>Streptopetalum wittei</h1>
<p>Streptopetalum wittei, commonly known as the Witte's streptopetalum, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
