                    <h1>Sparganophorus ethulia</h1>
<p>Sparganophorus ethulia, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale lavender petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the thin, cold air. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, typically under full moon conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
