                    <h1>Salix herbacea</h1>
<p>Salix herbacea, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
