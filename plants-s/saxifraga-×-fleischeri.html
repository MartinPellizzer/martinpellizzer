<p>Saxifraga × fleischeri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
