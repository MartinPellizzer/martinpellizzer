                    <h1>Schoenus marginatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal grass or marginate flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as estuaries and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-sided spikelets that are usually greenish or brownish in color.</p>
<p>Schoenus marginatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
