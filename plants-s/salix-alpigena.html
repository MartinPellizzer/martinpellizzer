                    <h1>Salix alpigena</h1>
<p>Salix alpigena, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its main reproductive structures, and has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Salix alpigena plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various mountain-dwelling wildlife species.</p>
