<p>Senecio jacobaea subsp.</p>
<p>lycopifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ragwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and tall, branched stems that bear yellow-rayed composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
