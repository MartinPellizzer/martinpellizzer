                    <h1>Sphaerocionium pendulum</h1>
<p>Sphaerocionium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>
<p>Sphaerocionium pendulum is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
