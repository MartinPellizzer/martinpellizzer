<p>Saxifraga stolonifera f. aptera, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
