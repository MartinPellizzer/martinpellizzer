<p>Sedum acre var. imbricatum, commonly known as the stonecrop or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate poor soils and drought conditions makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
