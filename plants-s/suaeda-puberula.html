<p>Suaeda puberula, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Suaeda puberula plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting coastal ecosystems.</p>
