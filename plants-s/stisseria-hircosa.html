                    <h1>Stisseria hircosa</h1>
<p>Stisseria hircosa, commonly known as the woolly marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, woolly leaves that help retain moisture in its often soggy environment. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinct sepals and petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Stisseria hircosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
