                    <h1>Salix oesculus</h1>
<p>Salix oesculus, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many willow species. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a soft, downy texture.</p>
<p>Salix oesculus is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
