                    <h1>Stauracanthus aphyllus f. spartioides</h1>
<p>Stauracanthus aphyllus f. spartioides, commonly known as the desert sun cactus, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and minimal foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant's stems are typically green and covered in small, spiny projections that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaping.</p>
