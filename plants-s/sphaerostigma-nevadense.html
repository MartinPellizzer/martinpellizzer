                    <h1>Sphaerostigma nevadense</h1>
<p>Sphaerostigma nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada globeberry, is a rare plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth form and small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to extreme desert conditions, including deep root systems and thick, waxy cuticles.</p>
<p>Sphaerostigma nevadense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
