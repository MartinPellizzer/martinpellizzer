<p>Saxifraga omolojensis, commonly known as the Omoloje saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
