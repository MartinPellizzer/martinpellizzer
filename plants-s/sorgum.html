<p>Sorgum, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is widely cultivated for its edible grains, which are used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production. The plant has deep roots that help prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tall panicles of small, fluffy flowers.</p>
<p>Sorgum is highly drought-tolerant, making it a valuable crop in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
