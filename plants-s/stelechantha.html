                    <h1>Stelechantha</h1>
<p>Stelechantha, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a compact, succulent-like structure with fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. Stelechantha is characterized by its unique stele, a central vascular structure that supports its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
