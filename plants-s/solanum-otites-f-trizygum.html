                    <h1>Solanum otites f. trizygum</h1>
<p>Solanum otites f. trizygum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, fleshy berries containing toxic alkaloids. Its foliage is often covered in dense, white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems, despite the toxicity of its fruits.</p>
