<p>Senecio jugicola, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Senecio jugicola is well adapted to drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
