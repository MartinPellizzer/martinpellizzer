                    <h1>Scadianus</h1>
<p>Scadianus, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Scadianus is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, Scadianus, reflects its historical association with the Scadian region, now part of New Mexico.</p>
