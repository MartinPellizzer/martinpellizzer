                <h1>Sporobolus arenarius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus arenarius, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or desert environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus arenarius is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system.</p>
