<p>Sphaeropteris senilis, commonly known as the old man's bamboo, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender, and somewhat woody stems that resemble bamboo, which are covered in a dense layer of brown, scaly bark. The plant produces large, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, twisted appearance, and its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the leaves. Sphaeropteris senilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant that is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
