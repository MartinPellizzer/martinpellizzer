                    <h1>Salix desertorum</h1>
<p>Salix desertorum, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salix desertorum is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
