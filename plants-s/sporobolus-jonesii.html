<p>Sporobolus jonesii, commonly known as Jones' sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>
