                    <h1>Silene keiskei</h1>
<p>Silene keiskei, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique ability to survive in harsh, salty environments, often growing on rocky shores and dunes. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against strong winds.</p>
<p>Silene keiskei is also known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, with flowers appearing only briefly before wilting.</p>
