                    <h1>Solanum looserii</h1>
<p>Solanum looserii, commonly known as the Looser's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, lowland areas. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
