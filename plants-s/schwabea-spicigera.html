                    <h1>Schwabea spicigera</h1>
<p>Schwabea spicigera, commonly known as the spiky schwabea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Schwabea spicigera is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role in desert ecosystems make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
