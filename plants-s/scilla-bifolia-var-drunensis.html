<p>Scilla bifolia var. drunensis, commonly known as the Drunensk scilla, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
