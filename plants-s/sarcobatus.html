<p>Sarcobatus, commonly known as greasewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert regions of North America. They produce small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Sarcobatus species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
