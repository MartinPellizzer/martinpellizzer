                    <h1>Salicornia uniflora</h1>
<p>Salicornia uniflora, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or pink hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid or salty conditions.</p>
<p>Salicornia uniflora plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
