<p>Saxifraga unguiculata, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga unguiculata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in full sun.</p>
