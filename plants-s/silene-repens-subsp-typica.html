<p>Silene repens subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the prostrate campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene repens subsp.</p>
<p>typica is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and coastal dunes.</p>
