                            <h1>Spelta Amylea</h1>
<p>Buckwheat, scientifically known as Spelta amylea, is a hardy, ancient grain that has been cultivated for thousands of years. Native to Europe and Asia, it thrives in cool climates and poor soils, making it a resilient crop. Despite its name, buckwheat is not related to wheat and is actually a member of the Polygonaceae family. Its seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, fiber, and essential minerals, making it a valuable addition to modern diets. As interest in ancient grains grows, buckwheat is gaining recognition for its health benefits and sustainability.</p>
