<p>Sparganium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spiky, cylindrical flower heads that mature into bur-like structures. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds.</p>
<p>Sparganium angustifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
