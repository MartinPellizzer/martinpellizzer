                    <h1>Senecio reniformis</h1>
<p>Senecio reniformis, commonly known as the rubber plant or African violets, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps store water. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, often blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening.</p>
