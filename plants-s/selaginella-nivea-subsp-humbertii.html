<p>Selaginella nivea subsp.</p>
<p>humbertii, commonly known as the white spikerush, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in challenging climates make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
