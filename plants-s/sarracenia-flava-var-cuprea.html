                    <h1>Sarracenia flava var. cuprea</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava var. cuprea, commonly known as the red-tipped pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid orange-red pitchers, which are highly effective at trapping insects. The plant's leaves form deep, narrow tubes lined with a slippery wax that prevents prey from escaping. These pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to break down captured insects, providing essential nutrients.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
