                    <h1>Slevogtia occidentalis</h1>
<p>Slevogtia occidentalis, commonly known as the western slevogtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, coastal habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slight pubescence that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
