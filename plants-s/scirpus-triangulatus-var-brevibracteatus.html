                    <h1>Scirpus triangulatus var. brevibracteatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus triangulatus var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-bract bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its triangular stems and reduced bracts.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than other bulrush species. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystem health.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to the typical Scirpus triangulatus.</p>
