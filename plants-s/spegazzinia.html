<p>Spegazzinia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, hardy ferns native to arid and rocky regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Spegazzinia species typically have fronds that are narrow and often recurved, with a distinctive appearance that helps them blend into their rocky habitats. They are well adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making them resilient in challenging environments.</p>
<p>The genus is part of the family Polypodiaceae and is often found in Mediterranean and South American regions.</p>
