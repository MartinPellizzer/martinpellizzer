                    <h1>Sonchus asper var. laciniatus</h1>
<p>Sonchus asper var. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
