                    <h1>Setaria palustris</h1>
<p>Setaria palustris, commonly known as swamp millet, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
