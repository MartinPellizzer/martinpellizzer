                    <h1>Styloncerus platycephalus</h1>
<p>Styloncerus platycephalus, commonly known as the flat-headed styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flat, broad head and elongated body, which are adaptations for its specific ecological niche. The beetle's exoskeleton is typically hardened and often exhibits a metallic or dark coloration, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it inhabits forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution, Styloncerus platycephalus is of interest to entomologists studying biodiversity and ecological specialization.</p>
