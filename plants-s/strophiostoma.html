<p>Strophiostoma, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a genus of moss-like plants belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that often form a dense, cushion-like growth. The leaves are usually curved or twisted, giving the plant its distinctive spiral appearance. Strophiostoma species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in soil stabilization and contribute to the biodiversity of their ecosystems.</p>
