<p>Sphalmanthus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. It is often found in coastal and inland regions, and it is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
