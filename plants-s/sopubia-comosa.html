<p>Sopubia comosa, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Sopubia comosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
