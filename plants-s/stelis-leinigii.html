                    <h1>Stelis leinigii</h1>
<p>Stelis leinigii, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions.</p>
