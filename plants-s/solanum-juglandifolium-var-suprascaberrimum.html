                    <h1>Solanum juglandifolium var. suprascaberrimum</h1>
<p>Solanum juglandifolium var. suprascaberrimum, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important crops and toxic species.</p>
<p>Due to its hairy foliage and potential toxicity, it is often found in rocky or arid habitats where it can thrive with minimal water.</p>
