                    <h1>Saxifraga reniformis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
