<p>Struthanthus retusus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and sandy plains, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Struthanthus retusus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
