                    <h1>Sorghum miliaceum</h1>
<p>Sorghum miliaceum, commonly known as millet, is an annual grass species native to the warmer regions of the Old World.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped grains that are typically yellow, red, or white in color. The plant produces a dense panicle of spikelets, which are the flower clusters, and thrives in dry, arid conditions. Millet is a hardy crop that is well-suited for cultivation in poor soils and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots, narrow leaves, and a robust stem that supports the grain-bearing inflorescence.</p>
