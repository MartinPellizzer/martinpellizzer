<p>Stipa argillosa, commonly known as clay grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in clay-rich environments, and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Stipa argillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats.</p>
