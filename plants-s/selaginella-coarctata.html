                    <h1>Selaginella coarctata</h1>
<p>Selaginella coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a distinctive rosette of spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Selaginella coarctata is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
