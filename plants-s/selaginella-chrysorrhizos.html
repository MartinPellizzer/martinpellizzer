<p>Selaginella chrysorrhizos, commonly known as the golden root spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation. The plant has a creeping stem with clusters of small, scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and resilience.</p>
