<p>Saxifraga porophylla, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in exposed environments where other plants struggle to survive. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Saxifragaceae family.</p>
<p>Saxifraga porophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountain habitats.</p>
