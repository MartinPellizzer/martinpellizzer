                            <h1>Selenipedium × Stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × stenophyllum is a rare and fascinating hybrid plant belonging to the ginger family. It is known for its striking appearance and unique growth habits, making it a prized specimen among plant enthusiasts. This hybrid results from the cross between Selenipedium albertii and Selenipedium luteum, two species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and highly sought after in conservation efforts. Its cultivation is challenging, requiring careful attention to light, moisture, and temperature conditions.</p>
