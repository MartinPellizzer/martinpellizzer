                    <h1>Sporobolus giganteus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus giganteus, commonly known as giant sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems.</p>
