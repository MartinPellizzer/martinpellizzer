                    <h1>Silene tagadirtensis f. brevipedunculata</h1>
<p>Silene tagadirtensis f. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed bladder campion, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced peduncles. The plant features pink to purple flowers that bloom during the dry season, adapted to its arid environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
