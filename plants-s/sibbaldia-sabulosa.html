<p>Sibbaldia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Sibbaldia sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme environment and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
