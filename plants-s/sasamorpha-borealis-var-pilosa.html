                    <h1>Sasamorpha borealis var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Sasamorpha borealis var. pilosa, commonly known as the northern hairy sasamorpha, is a rare flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine and boreal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
