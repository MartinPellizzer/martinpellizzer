The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing both visual appeal and erosion control in rocky environments.</p>
