                    <h1>Staurogyne repens</h1>
<p>Staurogyne repens, commonly known as the floating meadow or water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the water's surface. Its small, opposite leaves are usually submerged, while the flowers are borne on short stalks above the water.</p>
<p>Staurogyne repens plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water turbulence and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
