<p>Siphoneugena chnoosepala var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water and support its massive size. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The varietal name *macrophylla* refers to its large, showy floral structures, which are a key feature of this species.</p>
