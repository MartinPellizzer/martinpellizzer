                    <h1>Scurrula cultarum</h1>
<p>Scurrula cultarum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of pine flatwoods and cypress swamps, often growing on the trunks of trees. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are specialized to absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater. Its flowers are white and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Scurrula cultarum is considered an endangered species.</p>
