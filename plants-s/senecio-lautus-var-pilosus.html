<p>Senecio lautus var. pilosus, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
