                    <h1>Saxifraga cernua var. genuina</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cernua var. genuina, commonly known as the upright saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a common sight in high-altitude habitats across the northern hemisphere.</p>
