<p>Scorpiurus echinatus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It features a succulent, branched stem covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and also bear a similar hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
