                    <h1>Salvia hilarii</h1>
<p>Salvia hilarii, commonly known as the Hilari's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, woody structure and vibrant violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Salvia hilarii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
