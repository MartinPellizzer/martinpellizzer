<p>Sphaerostephanos beccarianus, commonly known as the Beccari's globular star, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spherical inflorescence that resembles a star, composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
