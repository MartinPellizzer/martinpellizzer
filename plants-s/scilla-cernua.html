<p>Scilla cernua, commonly known as nodding scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Scilla cernua is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread easily in suitable conditions.</p>
