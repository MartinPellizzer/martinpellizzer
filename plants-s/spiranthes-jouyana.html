                    <h1>Spiranthes jouyana</h1>
<p>Spiranthes jouyana, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils in forested areas, often near streams or in bogs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
