                    <h1>Saccharum brunneum</h1>
<p>Saccharum brunneum, commonly known as the yellow grass or brown sugarcane, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is often found in wetland areas and can thrive in moist, tropical climates. Its fibrous stalks are sometimes used for thatching or as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>While not as economically important as sugarcane, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional practices.</p>
