                    <h1>Stapelia schinzii var. bergeriana</h1>
<p>Stapelia schinzii var. bergeriana, commonly known as the "Carrion Flower," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, waxy, and often foul-smelling花朵 that mimic decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, enhancing their deceptive appearance.</p>
