<p>Salicornia procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>freitagii, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophyte species that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and salt marshes. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water, enabling survival in arid and salty conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are scale-like and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to high salinity and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
