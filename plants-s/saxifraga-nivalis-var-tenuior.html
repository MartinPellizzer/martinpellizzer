<p>Saxifraga nivalis var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
