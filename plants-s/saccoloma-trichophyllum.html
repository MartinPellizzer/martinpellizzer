<p>Saccoloma trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Argentina. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across forest floors in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Saccoloma trichophyllum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
