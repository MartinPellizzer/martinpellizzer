<p>Salix nigricans var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and serrated. It has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
