<p>Santaloides rubella, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruits are usually berry-like and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
