<p>Swertia wardii var. rigida is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of southern China. It belongs to the gentian family, known for its vibrant and often blue or purple flowers. This variant is distinguished by its rigid, upright stems and dense clusters of small, bright blue flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a prized subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
