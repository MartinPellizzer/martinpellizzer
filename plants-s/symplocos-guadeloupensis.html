                    <h1>Symplocos guadeloupensis</h1>
<p>Symplocos guadeloupensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, violet to purple berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its flowers are bell-shaped and usually white or pale pink, appearing in the spring before the leaves fully develop.</p>
<p>Symplocos guadeloupensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
