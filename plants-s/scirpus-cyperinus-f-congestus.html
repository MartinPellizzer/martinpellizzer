<p>Scirpus cyperinus f. congestus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Scirpus cyperinus. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically clustered in spikelets at the tips of the stems, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This form is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
