                    <h1>Sparganium ramosum subvar. platycarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium ramosum subvar. platycarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruit bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spiky, cylindrical fruits.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense canopy that helps stabilize aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated fruits compared to other forms of Sparganium ramosum.</p>
