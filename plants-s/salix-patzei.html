                    <h1>Salix patzei</h1>
<p>Salix patzei, commonly known as the Patzec Willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Salix patzei is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, with a deep root system that helps it anchor in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of alpine plant ecology.</p>
