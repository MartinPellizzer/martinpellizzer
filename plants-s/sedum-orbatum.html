<p>Sedum orbatum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It grows in a low, spreading manner, forming dense mats that cover the ground.</p>
<p>Sedum orbatum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
