                    <h1>Sedum griseum</h1>
<p>Sedum griseum, commonly known as the blue sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, Sedum griseum is a popular plant among gardeners in dry climates.</p>
