                    <h1>Salix falcata</h1>
<p>Salix falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and riparian zones, and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix falcata is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types.</p>
