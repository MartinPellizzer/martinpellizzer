<p>Sessea pedicellata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
