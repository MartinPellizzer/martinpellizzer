<p>Struthanthus lucarquensis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that grows from a taproot and produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Struthanthus lucarquensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
