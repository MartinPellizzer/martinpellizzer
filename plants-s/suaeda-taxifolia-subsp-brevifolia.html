<p>Suaeda taxifolia subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolia, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in arid coastal regions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in small, smooth capsules that disperse via wind or water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy soils along shorelines and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes.</p>
