<p>Senecio zapalae, commonly known as the Zapala groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils, and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio zapalae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
