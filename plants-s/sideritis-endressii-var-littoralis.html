                    <h1>Sideritis endressii var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Sideritis endressii var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sideritis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or coastal habitats. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along rocky coastlines or in dry, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
