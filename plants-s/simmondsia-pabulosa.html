                    <h1>Simmondsia pabulosa</h1>
<p>Simmondsia pabulosa, commonly known as the desert chia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, edible seeds that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, making them a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>
