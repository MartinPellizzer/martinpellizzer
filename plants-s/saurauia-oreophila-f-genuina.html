<p>Saurauia oreophila f. genuina, commonly known as the mountain saurauia, is a rare plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it bears dark blue, leathery berries.
