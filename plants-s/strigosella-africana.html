                <h1>Strigosella africana</h1>
<p>Strigosella africana, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, making it harmful to livestock and humans. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Strigosella africana plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
