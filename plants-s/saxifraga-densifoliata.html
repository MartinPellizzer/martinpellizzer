The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
