<p>Stelis yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauap√© orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
