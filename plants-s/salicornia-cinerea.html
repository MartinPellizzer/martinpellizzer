<p>Salicornia cinerea, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and the stems are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Salicornia cinerea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
