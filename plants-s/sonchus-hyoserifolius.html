                    <h1>Sonchus hyoserifolius</h1>
<p>Sonchus hyoserifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
