                    <h1>Sphaeritis</h1>
<p>Sphaeritis, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, compact growth form and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Sphaeritis species typically have a thallus that is globular or cushion-like, with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. They reproduce through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called soridia.</p>
<p>Due to their unique morphology and ecological preferences, Sphaeritis species are important indicators of humid, undisturbed habitats.</p>
