<p>Sempervivum montanum f. dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomite Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Dolomites in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to rocky, alpine environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in rocky garden settings.</p>
