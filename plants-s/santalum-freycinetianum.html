<p>Santalum freycinetianum, commonly known as the Freycinet sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in the perfume and incense industries. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The tree is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and precious resource in its native habitat.</p>
