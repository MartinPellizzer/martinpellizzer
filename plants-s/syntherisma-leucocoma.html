<p>Syntherisma leucocoma, commonly known as the white lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, crust-like thallus with a pale to white coloration. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Its structure and composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
