                    <h1>Saxifraga nivalis var. gaspensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nivalis var. gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp√© saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, often found in alpine and arctic regions where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical Saxifraga nivalis.</p>
