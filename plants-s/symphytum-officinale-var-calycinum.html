<p>Symphytum officinale var. calycinum, commonly known as the Armenian cowpea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the Greek "symphyton," meaning "growing together," referring to the way its leaves and stems fuse at the base.</p>
