                    <h1>Samara saligna</h1>
<p>Samara saligna, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged seeds called samaras, which are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and silvery-gray, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Samara saligna is often found near water sources and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
