                    <h1>Stuckenia × fennica</h1>
<p>Stuckenia × fennica, commonly known as the common water plantain, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stuckenia palustris and Stuckenia triqueta.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Stuckenia × fennica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and waterfowl.</p>
