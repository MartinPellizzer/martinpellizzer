                    <h1>Salsola prostrata var. rubens</h1>
<p>Salsola prostrata var. rubens, commonly known as red sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically reddish in color, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground to form dense mats, which aids in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in deserts, dunes, and disturbed areas.</p>
