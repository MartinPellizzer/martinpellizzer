<p>Setaria adhaerens var. font-queri, commonly known as Font-Qu√©ri's bluestem, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually bluish-green, and the plant is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
