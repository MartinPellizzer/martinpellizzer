<p>Sclerolaena parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sclerolaena, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Sclerolaena parviflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
