                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. enode</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. enode, commonly known as the enodated potato, is a botanical variant of the potato plant characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a distinctive elongated and narrow flower, which sets it apart from the typical potato flower. The enodated form is primarily observed in wild or less commonly cultivated populations of Solanum tuberosum. It is notable for its potential role in genetic diversity and breeding programs.</p>
<p>The plant retains the basic characteristics of the potato, including its tuberous roots and solanaceae family traits.</p>
