<p>Salix eriostachya, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a soft, fuzzy texture on the upper surface, while the underside is covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
