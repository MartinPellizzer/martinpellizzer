<p>Selaginella weatherbiana, commonly known as the Weatherby's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores, a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
