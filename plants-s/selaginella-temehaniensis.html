                    <h1>Selaginella temehaniensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella temehaniensis, commonly known as the Temehani spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with clustered, scale-like leaves that are often reddish in color. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in tropical ecosystems.</p>
