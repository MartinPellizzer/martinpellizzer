                    <h1>Scoria minima</h1>
<p>Scoria minima, commonly known as the dwarf scoria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the rocky, arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, grayish-green leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Scoria minima is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying succulent flora.</p>
