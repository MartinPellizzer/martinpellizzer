                    <h1>Spathiphyllum friedrichsthalii var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Spathiphyllum friedrichsthalii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It features broad, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard peace lily, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, spathe-like flowers that are typical of the Spathiphyllum genus. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate moisture and humidity.</p>
<p>Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
