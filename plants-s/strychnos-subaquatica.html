                    <h1>Strychnos subaquatica</h1>
<p>Strychnos subaquatica, commonly known as the water strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and lakeshores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>While it has some ornamental value, the plant is not widely cultivated due to its preference for specific wetland habitats.</p>
