<p>Stapelia woodfordiana, commonly known as the Ghost Flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia woodfordiana is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
