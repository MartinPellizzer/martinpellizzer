                    <h1>Selaginella spuriemarginata</h1>
<p>Selaginella spuriemarginata, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spiky, creeping plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to tolerate drought make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
