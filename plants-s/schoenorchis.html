                    <h1>Schoenorchis</h1>
<p>Schoenorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphyte rather than a terrestrial plant. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that enhance its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Schoenorchis is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
