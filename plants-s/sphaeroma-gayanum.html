<p>Sphaeroma gayanum, commonly known as the red sea urchin, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Diadematidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular body covered in short, spiny projections that provide both protection and a means of movement. The organism is primarily found in tropical and subtropical shallow waters, where it thrives on rocky substrates. Its exoskeleton is composed of calcareous plates, which contribute to its structural integrity and defense against predators.</p>
<p>Sphaeroma gayanum plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and serving as a food source for various marine animals.</p>
