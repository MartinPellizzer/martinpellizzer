<p>Sapium sebiferum var. cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped Chinese Tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping purposes.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal.</p>
