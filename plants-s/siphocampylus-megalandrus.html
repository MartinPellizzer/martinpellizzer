<p>Siphocampylus megalandrus, commonly known as the giant landrail, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>

Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, umbrella-like inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
