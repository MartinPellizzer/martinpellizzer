                    <h1>Sarcocolla tetragona</h1>
<p>Sarcocolla tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled sarcocolla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, four-sided stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Sarcocolla tetragona is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
