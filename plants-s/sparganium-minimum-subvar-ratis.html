                    <h1>Sparganium minimum subvar. ratis</h1>
<p>Sparganium minimum subvar. ratis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, lake margins, and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are spiky, three-sided burrs that help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its reduced leaf width and smaller flower clusters compared to other forms of Sparganium.</p>
