                    <h1>Saxifraga filifolia var. rosettifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga filifolia var. rosettifolia, commonly known as the rosette saxifrage, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
