                    <h1>Sedum spiralifolium</h1>
<p>Sedum spiralifolium, commonly known as the spiral-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
