                    <h1>Stylimnus</h1>
<p>Stylimnus, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Stylimnus species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Their roots anchor them in the sediment, while their leaves provide a surface for aquatic insects and other organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers play a crucial role in attracting pollinators like beetles and flies.</p>
