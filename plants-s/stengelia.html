                    <h1>Stengelia</h1>
<p>Stengelia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to regions in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, calcareous soils. Stengelia species are typically herbaceous and have a short lifespan, completing their life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Due to their delicate appearance and unique morphology, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
