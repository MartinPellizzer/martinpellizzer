                    <h1>Saxifraga flagellaris var. stenosepala</h1>
<p>Saxifraga flagellaris var. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Saxifraga flagellaris var. stenosepala is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes.</p>
