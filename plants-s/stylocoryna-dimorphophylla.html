<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have two different formsâ€”some are broad and floating, while others are narrow and submerged. The plant's flowers are typically small and white, emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
