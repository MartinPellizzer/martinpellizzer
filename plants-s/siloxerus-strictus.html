                    <h1>Siloxerus strictus</h1>
<p>Siloxerus strictus, commonly known as the rigid silversword, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and silver-gray foliage, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces a single, showy yellow flower at the top of its stem, which blooms once in its lifetime before the plant dies. Siloxerus strictus thrives in volcanic soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
