<p>Sedum amplibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-bract stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum amplibracteatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local pollinators.</p>
