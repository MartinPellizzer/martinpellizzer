                    <h1>Salix nigrocosticata</h1>
<p>Salix nigrocosticata, commonly known as the black-costed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and dark, almost blackish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges.</p>
