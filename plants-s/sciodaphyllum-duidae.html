                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum duidae</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum duidae, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires partial shade, making it well-suited for shaded, moist environments. Its unique photoluminescent properties have made it a subject of scientific interest.</p>
<p>Botanists note that its reproductive cycle involves spore dispersal through wind, typical of many fern species.</p>
