<p>Selago exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Selago exigua is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects in desert environments.</p>
