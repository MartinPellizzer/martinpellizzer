<p>Silene acaulis subsp.</p>
<p>cenisia, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
