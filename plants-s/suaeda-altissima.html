                    <h1>Suaeda altissima</h1>
<p>Suaeda altissima, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Suaeda altissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
