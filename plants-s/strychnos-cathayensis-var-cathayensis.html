                    <h1>Strychnos cathayensis var. cathayensis</h1>
<p>Strychnos cathayensis var. cathayensis, commonly known as the Chinese strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is notable for containing alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is primarily of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies.</p>
