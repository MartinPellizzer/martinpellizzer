                    <h1>Salpinga glandulosa</h1>
<p>Salpinga glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky root plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its sticky texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow and bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
