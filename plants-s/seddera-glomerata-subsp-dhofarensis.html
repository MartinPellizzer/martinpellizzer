<p>Seddera glomerata subsp.</p>
<p>dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar seddera, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of Oman. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it resilient in semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a species of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
