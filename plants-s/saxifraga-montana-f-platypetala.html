<p>Saxifraga montana f. platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features succulent, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with flat petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
