<p>Scirpus californicus var. tatora, commonly known as the California tatora, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, sloughs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
