<p>Salix atrocinerea subf.</p>
<p>tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and dark in color, with a somewhat flaky texture.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
