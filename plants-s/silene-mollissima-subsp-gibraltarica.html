<p>Silene mollissima subsp.</p>
<p>gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August.</p>
<p>The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is adapted to grow in limestone soils and is often found in coastal cliffs and rock crevices.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>
