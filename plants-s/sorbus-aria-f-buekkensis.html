                    <h1>Sorbus aria f. buekkensis</h1>
<p>Sorbus aria f. buekkensis, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the whitebeam tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and small, white or pale yellow leaves that persist throughout the winter. The plant is native to Hungary and is considered a subspecies of Sorbus aria, with specific adaptations to its local environment. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
