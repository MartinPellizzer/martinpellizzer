                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. nigrum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. nigrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a botanical variant of the potato plant characterized by its dark purple to black foliage and berries.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, toxic berries that turn from green to black as they mature.</p>
<p>While it shares some genetic traits with the common potato, it is not cultivated for food due to its bitter taste and potential toxicity.</p>
