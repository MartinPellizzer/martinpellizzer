<p>Schizoloma falcatum, commonly known as the flatleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a leathery texture and a pale green to yellowish color. The thallus is composed of a fungal matrix that hosts various algae, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is often found on decaying wood or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
