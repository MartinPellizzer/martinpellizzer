<p>Selaginella illustris, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often described as resembling a club, hence its common name. Selaginella illustris reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions through a process called cryptobiosis.</p>
<p>Its presence in ecological systems contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
