                    <h1>Salsola flavescens</h1>
<p>Salsola flavescens, commonly known as bluish wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, and has adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
<p>Salsola flavescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
