                    <h1>Sclerochloa arenaria</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa arenaria, commonly known as sandblow grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa arenaria is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control in sandy soils.</p>
