<p>Sonchus laevissimus, commonly known as the smooth sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
