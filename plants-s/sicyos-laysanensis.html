<p>Sicyos laysanensis, commonly known as the Laysan bottle-gourd, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Laysan.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes vines and climbers, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by a unique, inflated fruit resembling a bottle. Due to its restricted range and habitat, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in coastal dune environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species from threats such as invasive species and habitat loss.</p>
