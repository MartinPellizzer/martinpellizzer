                    <h1>Selaginella sinuosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella sinuosa, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella sinuosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
