                    <h1>Salix testacea</h1>
<p>Salix testacea, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix testacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration.</p>
