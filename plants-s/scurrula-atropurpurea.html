<p>Scurrula atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple scurrula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a reddish or purplish hue, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scurrula atropurpurea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
