                    <h1>Salix caprea f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Salix caprea f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the common willow native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical Salix caprea. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats.</p>
