                    <h1>Sphaeropteris pilulifera</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris pilulifera, commonly known as the ball fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical fronds that give it a unique, compact appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that resemble tiny balls, hence its common name.</p>
