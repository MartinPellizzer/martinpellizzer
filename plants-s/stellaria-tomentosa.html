                    <h1>Stellaria tomentosa</h1>
<p>Stellaria tomentosa, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Stellaria tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and blooms.</p>
