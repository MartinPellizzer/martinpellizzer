                    <h1>Selaginella amboinensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella amboinensis, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique capacity to enter a state of cryptobiosis, allowing it to withstand prolonged drought conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are small, linear, and closely spaced, forming a dense, mat-like structure.</p>
<p>Selaginella amboinensis is also characterized by its spore-producing structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
