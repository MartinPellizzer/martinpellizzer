<p>Saxifraga androsacea var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower atop a slender stem during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in cool climates as a garden plant.</p>
