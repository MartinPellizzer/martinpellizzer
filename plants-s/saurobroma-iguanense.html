<p>Saurobroma iguanense, commonly known as the iguana's ghost plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saurobroma iguanense is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
