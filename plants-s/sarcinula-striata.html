<p>Sarcinula striata, commonly known as the striated sarcinula, is a species of seagrass found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that are often ribbed or striated, giving it its common name. The plant forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for a variety of marine life. Its rhizomes spread horizontally along the seafloor, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Sarcinula striata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and maintaining water quality in its ecosystem.</p>
