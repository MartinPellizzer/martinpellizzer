<p>Solomon's knob, or Solanum americanum var. patulum, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern united states. it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and creek banks. the plant is known for its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture. despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
