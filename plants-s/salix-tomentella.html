                    <h1>Salix tomentella</h1>
<p>Salix tomentella, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Salix tomentella is adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
