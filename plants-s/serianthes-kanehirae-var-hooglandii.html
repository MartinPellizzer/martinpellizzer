                    <h1>Serianthes kanehirae var. hooglandii</h1>
<p>Serianthes kanehirae var. hooglandii, commonly known as the Kona ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and distinctive grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
