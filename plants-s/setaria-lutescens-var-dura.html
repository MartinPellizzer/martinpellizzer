                    <h1>Setaria lutescens var. dura</h1>
<p>Setaria lutescens var. dura, commonly known as stiff bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale yellow to brown florets. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Setaria lutescens var. dura is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture.</p>
