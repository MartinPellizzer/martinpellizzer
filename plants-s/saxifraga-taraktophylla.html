<p>Saxifraga taraktophylla, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
