                    <h1>Serissa</h1>
<p>Serissa, commonly known as the jade plant or snow rose, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, waxy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries. Serissa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for bonsai and decorative gardening.</p>
