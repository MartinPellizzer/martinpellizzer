                    <h1>Stenochlaena japurensis</h1>
<p>Stenochlaena japurensis, commonly known as the Japur√© fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
