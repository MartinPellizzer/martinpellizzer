                    <h1>Samyda iroucana</h1>
<p>Samyda iroucana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Samyda iroucana is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
