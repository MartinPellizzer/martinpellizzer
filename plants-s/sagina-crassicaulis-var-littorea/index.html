                            <h1>Sagina Crassicaulis Var. Littorea</h1>
<p>Sagina crassicaulis var. littorea is a low-growing, mat-forming plant commonly found in coastal and moist environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen along shorelines and in wet meadows. This variety is known for its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its ability to withstand salt spray and harsh weather makes it a hardy species. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
