                    <h1>Schizocodon soldanelloides var. minimus</h1>
<p>Schizocodon soldanelloides var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in loose, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
