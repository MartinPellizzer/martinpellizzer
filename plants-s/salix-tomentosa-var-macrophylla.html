                    <h1>Salix tomentosa var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Salix tomentosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the woolly willow with large leaves, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Salix tomentosa. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
