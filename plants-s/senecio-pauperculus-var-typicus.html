<p>Senecio pauperculus var. typicus, commonly known as the poor man's ragwort, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
