                    <h1>Sida sellowiana</h1>
<p>Sida sellowiana, commonly known as Brazilian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its seeds are enclosed in capsules that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Sida sellowiana is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
