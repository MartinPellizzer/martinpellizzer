                    <h1>Santalum murrayanum</h1>
<p>Santalum murrayanum, commonly known as the Murray sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the eastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its use in perfumes, incense, and traditional medicine. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in coastal or rainforest habitats, preferring well-drained soils and moderate to high humidity.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
