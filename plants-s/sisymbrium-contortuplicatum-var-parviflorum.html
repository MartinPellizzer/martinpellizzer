                    <h1>Sisymbrium contortuplicatum var. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium contortuplicatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a challenging species to manage.</p>
