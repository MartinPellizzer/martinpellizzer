                    <h1>Sophronitis pabstii</h1>
<p>Sophronitis pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, specifically in the Andes of Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sophronitis pabstii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
