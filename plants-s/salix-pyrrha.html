                    <h1>Salix pyrrha</h1>
<p>Salix pyrrha, commonly known as the Persian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix pyrrha is smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that makes it somewhat durable.</p>
