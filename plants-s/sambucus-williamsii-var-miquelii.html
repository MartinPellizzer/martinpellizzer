                    <h1>Sambucus williamsii var. miquelii</h1>
<p>Sambucus williamsii var. miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the autumn. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity and potential toxicity if not ripe.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
