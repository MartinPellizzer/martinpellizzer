                    <h1>Sclerocactus unguispinus</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus unguispinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the United States, particularly found in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant has green, ribbed stems covered with white, bristly spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid environments with well-draining soil.</p>
