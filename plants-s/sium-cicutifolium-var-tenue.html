                    <h1>Sium cicutifolium var. tenue</h1>
<p>Sium cicutifolium var. tenue, commonly known as slender water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often along the edges of ponds or streams. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its roots are similar to those of the common water parsnip but are generally thinner and less robust.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions of North America and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
