The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a rough, bark-like surface, and its leaves are pinnate, with a dark green color and a waxy texture. The leaves are often covered in small, spiny structures, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
