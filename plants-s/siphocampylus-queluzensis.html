                    <h1>Siphocampylus queluzensis</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus queluzensis, commonly known as the QueLuzean bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Portugal.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, open habitats. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Siphocampylus queluzensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
