<p>Stephanandra incisa f. quadrifissa, commonly known as the four-leaf stephanandra, is a unique variant of the stephanandra species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive quadrifid (four-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of the plant. The foliage is often glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is prized for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest.</p>
