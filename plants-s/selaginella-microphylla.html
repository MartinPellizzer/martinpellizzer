                    <h1>Selaginella microphylla</h1>
<p>Selaginella microphylla, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are typically clustered at the base of the rosette, containing both microspores and megaspores. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in dry conditions with its ability to enter dormancy.</p>
<p>Selaginella microphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
