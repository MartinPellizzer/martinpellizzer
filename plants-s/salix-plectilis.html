<p>Salix plectilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix plectilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful form and early spring blooms.</p>
