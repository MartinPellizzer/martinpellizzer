                <h1>Sorbopyrus bollwilleriana</h1>
<p>Sorbopyrus bollwilleriana, commonly known as the Bollwiller's sorbus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
