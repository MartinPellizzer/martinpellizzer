                    <h1>Saribus subglobosus</h1>
<p>Saribus subglobosus, commonly known as the globe sago palm, is a species of cycad native to the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that form a dense, spherical shape. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or on volcanic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
