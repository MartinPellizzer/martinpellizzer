<p>Scaphochlamys klossii var. minor, commonly known as the small-scaled scaphochlamys, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
