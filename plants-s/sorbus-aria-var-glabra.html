<p>Sorbus aria var. glabra, commonly known as whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Sorbus aria var. glabra is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
