                    <h1>Sasa nana f. permadescens</h1>
<p>Sasa nana f. permadescens, commonly known as the evergreen sasa, is a variant of the sasa plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a clump-forming perennial grass that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. The plant produces slender, upright shoots with narrow, dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>While it lacks showy flowers, its ecological value in forest ecosystems is significant.</p>
