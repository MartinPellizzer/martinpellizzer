                    <h1>Saxifraga callosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga callosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga callosa is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
