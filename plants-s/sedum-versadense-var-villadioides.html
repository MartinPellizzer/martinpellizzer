<p>Sedum versadense var. villadioides, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, adapted for water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates.</p>
