<p>Scabiosa acaulis, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of small, woolly leaves that form a cushion-like structure, which helps it thrive in rocky or dry environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers with five petals, often resembling small, rounded umbels. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Scabiosa acaulis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions.</p>
