                    <h1>Synoliga subulata</h1>
<p>Synoliga subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved synoliga, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, providing a striking visual contrast to its greyish bark. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
