                    <h1>Spicanta andina</h1>
<p>Spicanta andina, commonly known as the Andean thornplant, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Spicanta andina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
