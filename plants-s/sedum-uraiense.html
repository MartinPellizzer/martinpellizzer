<p>Sedum uraiense, commonly known as the Uraic sedum, is a succulent plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its leaves. Its leaves are typically green and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
