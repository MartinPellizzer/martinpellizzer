<p>Stellaria media subsp.</p>
<p>apetala, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and oval-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The subspecies apetala is distinguished by the absence of petals, giving it a simpler floral structure compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
