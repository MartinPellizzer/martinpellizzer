                    <h1>Stelis dendrophila</h1>
<p>Stelis dendrophila, commonly known as the tree orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, using its roots to anchor itself without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Stelis dendrophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
