                    <h1>Salsola monoptera</h1>
<p>Salsola monoptera, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prickly, leafless stems and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions.</p>
<p>Salsola monoptera is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
