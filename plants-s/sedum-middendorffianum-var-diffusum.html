<p>Sedum middendorffianum var. diffusum, commonly known as the spreading stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spreading stems that often form a low, mat-like growth pattern. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
