<p>Schizachyrium maritimum, commonly known as seaside bluestem, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces dense, upright clusters of blue to purple spikelets during the summer months. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schizachyrium maritimum is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects.</p>
