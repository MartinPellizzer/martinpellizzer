<p>Scutellaria repens, commonly known as creeping skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a sprawling habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, wooded areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Scutellaria repens is often found in rich, acidic soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
