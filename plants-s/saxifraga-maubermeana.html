<p>Saxifraga maubermeana, commonly known as the Maubermean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
