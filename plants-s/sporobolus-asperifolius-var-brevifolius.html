                    <h1>Sporobolus asperifolius var. brevifolius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus asperifolius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, gray-green leaves that are somewhat hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.</p>
