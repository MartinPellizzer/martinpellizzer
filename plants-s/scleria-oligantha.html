                    <h1>Scleria oligantha</h1>
<p>Scleria oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers that are usually white or pale blue. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Scleria oligantha is also an important plant for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
