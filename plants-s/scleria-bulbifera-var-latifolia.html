<p>Scleria bulbifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
