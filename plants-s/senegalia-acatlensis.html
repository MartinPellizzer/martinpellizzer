<p>Senegalia acatlensis, commonly known as the Mexican acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines, and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Additionally, its wood and foliage have been used traditionally by indigenous communities for various purposes.</p>
