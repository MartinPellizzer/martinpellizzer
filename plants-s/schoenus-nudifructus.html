                    <h1>Schoenus nudifructus</h1>
<p>Schoenus nudifructus, commonly known as the naked-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and it does not have true fruits, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Schoenus nudifructus thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
