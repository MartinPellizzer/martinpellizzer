                    <h1>Sparganophorus sonchifolius</h1>
<p>Sparganophorus sonchifolius, commonly known as the common burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by the development of spiny, bristly fruits known as burrs. These burrs contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to the plant's widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Sparganophorus sonchifolius is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
