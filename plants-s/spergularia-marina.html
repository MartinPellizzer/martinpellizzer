<p>Spergularia marina, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it is adapted to grow in soils with high salt content. The plant has small, clustered flowers that bloom in pink or white, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, helping it retain water in arid, salty conditions.</p>
<p>Spergularia marina plays an important role in stabilizing sandy shorelines and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
