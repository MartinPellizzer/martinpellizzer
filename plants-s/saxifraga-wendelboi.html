<p>Saxifraga wendelboi, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense cushions of foliage. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Saxifraga wendelboi is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive.</p>
