                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. rupincola</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. rupincola, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in small, cone-like structures at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its resilience and unique appearance make it an attractive and hardy addition to drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
