                    <h1>Sagittaria stolonifera</h1>
<p>Sagittaria stolonifera, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from rhizomes, often floating on the water surface or submerged in shallow water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize wetlands and pond edges.</p>
<p>Sagittaria stolonifera is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality.</p>
