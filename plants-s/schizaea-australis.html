                    <h1>Schizaea australis</h1>
<p>Schizaea australis, commonly known as the Australian clubmoss, is a species of fern ally native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations along the stems. Schizaea australis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
