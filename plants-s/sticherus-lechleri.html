<p>Sticherus lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces a milky sap that contains latex. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The rubber tree plays a vital role in the ecosystem and is also economically important for natural rubber production.</p>
