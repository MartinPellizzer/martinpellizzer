<p>Saussurea triangulata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, pale yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across high-altitude regions. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered with dense, white hairs.</p>
<p>Saussurea triangulata is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
