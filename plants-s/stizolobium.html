                    <h1>Stizolobium</h1>
<p>Stizolobium, commonly known as the African legume or African acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and compound leaves. Many species produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and they often have thorned stems as a defense mechanism. Stizolobium species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them important components of savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>They also play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in their native habitats.</p>
