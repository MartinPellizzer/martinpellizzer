<p>Sclarea ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
