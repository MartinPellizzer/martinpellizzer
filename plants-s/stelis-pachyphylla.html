                    <h1>Stelis pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Stelis pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
