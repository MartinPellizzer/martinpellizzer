                    <h1>Selaginella radiata</h1>
<p>Selaginella radiata, commonly known as the "spikemoss," is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella radiata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
