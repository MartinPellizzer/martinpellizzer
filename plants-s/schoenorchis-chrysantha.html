                    <h1>Schoenorchis chrysantha</h1>
<p>Schoenorchis chrysantha, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
