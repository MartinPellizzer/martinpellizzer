<p>Streptoloma desertorum, commonly known as the desert streptoloma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
