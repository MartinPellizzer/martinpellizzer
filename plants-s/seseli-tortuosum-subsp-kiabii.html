<p>Seseli tortuosum subsp.</p>
<p>kiabii, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Iran and Afghanistan, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
