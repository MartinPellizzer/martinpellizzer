<p>Stellaria alsine subsp.</p>
<p>inundata, commonly known as water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
