                    <h1>Scirpus olneyi f. minor</h1>
<p>Scirpus olneyi f. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in fluctuating water levels.</p>
