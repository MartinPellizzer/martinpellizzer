<p>Sciaphyllum amoenum, commonly known as the moonflower of the Andes, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andean mountains.

Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>Sciaphyllum amoenum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
