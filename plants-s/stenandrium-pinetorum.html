                    <h1>Stenandrium pinetorum</h1>
<p>Stenandrium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's botanical structure includes a short, creeping rhizome with numerous compound leaves that are finely divided. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Stenandrium pinetorum is often found growing in association with pine trees, hence its common name.</p>
