                    <h1>Selaginella pseudopaleifera</h1>
<p>Selaginella pseudopaleifera, commonly known as the ancient clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spores. Native to arid regions of South America, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a slow growth rate. The plant's ability to survive extreme environmental conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Its fossil record provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
