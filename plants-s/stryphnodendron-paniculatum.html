                    <h1>Stryphnodendron paniculatum</h1>
<p>Stryphnodendron paniculatum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
