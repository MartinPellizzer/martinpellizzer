                            <h1>Stelis Bertoniensis</h1>
<p>Bertoni's orchid, scientifically known as Stelis bertoniensis, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of South America. This delicate orchid is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Despite its beauty, little is known about its ecological role and reproductive habits.</p>
