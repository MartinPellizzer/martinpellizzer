                    <h1>Stenostomum involucratum</h1>
<p>Stenostomum involucratum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it relies on water for reproduction and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
