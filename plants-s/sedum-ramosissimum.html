<p>Sedum ramosissimum, commonly known as the silver rose or desert sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and can spread to form dense mats, making it a hardy ground cover.</p>
<p>Sedum ramosissimum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
