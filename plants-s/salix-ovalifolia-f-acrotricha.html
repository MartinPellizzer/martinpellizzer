                    <h1>Salix ovalifolia f. acrotricha</h1>
<p>Salix ovalifolia f. acrotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical Salix ovalifolia.</p>
