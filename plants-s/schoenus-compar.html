<p>Schoenus compar, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass found in marshy and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Schoenus compar plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
