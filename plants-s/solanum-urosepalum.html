<p>Solanum urosepalum, commonly known as the purple-stalked nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, which are typically purple or reddish in color, and its small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
