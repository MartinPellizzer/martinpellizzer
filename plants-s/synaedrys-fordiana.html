<p>Synaedrys fordiana, commonly known as the Ford's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafy, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host tree through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
