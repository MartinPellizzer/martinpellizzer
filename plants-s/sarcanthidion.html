                    <h1>Sarcanthidion</h1>
<p>Sarcanthidion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and its striking, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a specific microhabitat with high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, Sarcanthidion is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
