                    <h1>Stipa × iraquensis</h1>
<p>Stipa × iraquensis, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, perennial grass species resulting from the hybridization of Stipa capilata and Stipa robusta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It is native to regions of the Middle East and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, making it less common in natural populations.</p>
