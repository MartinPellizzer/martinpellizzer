<p>Schizaea balansae, commonly known as the Balansae spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a unique structure with a short, erect stem and a cluster of leaf-like structures called sporophylls.
