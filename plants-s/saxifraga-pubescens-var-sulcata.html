                    <h1>Saxifraga pubescens var. sulcata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pubescens var. sulcata, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
