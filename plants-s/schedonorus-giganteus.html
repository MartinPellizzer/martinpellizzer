<p>Schedonorus giganteus, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and coarse, dark green foliage. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand heavy grazing.</p>
<p>However, some varieties may contain ergot alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock.</p>
