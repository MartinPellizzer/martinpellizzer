<p>Senecio venturae, commonly known as the Ventura groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves with a grayish-green color.
