<p>Strophanthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing arrowroot, is a tropical vine native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves contain cardiotonic compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption without proper expertise.</p>
