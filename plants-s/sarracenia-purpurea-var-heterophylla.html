                    <h1>Sarracenia purpurea var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Sarracenia purpurea var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It exhibits a range of morphological variations, with some plants having broad, urn-shaped leaves and others with narrow, elongated pitchers. The plant's leaves are modified into tubular structures that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. Its growth form can vary significantly depending on environmental conditions, such as light exposure and moisture levels.</p>
<p>This variability makes it a popular subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanical researchers.</p>
