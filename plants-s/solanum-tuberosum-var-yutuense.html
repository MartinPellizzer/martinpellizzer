<p>Solanum tuberosum var. yutuense, commonly known as the Yutuense potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique tuber morphology, which includes smaller, more elongated tubers compared to typical potato varieties. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits typical solanum features such as alternate leaves and solanaceous flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
