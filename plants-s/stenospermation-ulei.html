                    <h1>Stenospermation ulei</h1>
<p>Stenospermation ulei, commonly known as the narrow-seeded oil palm, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves, which are often used in traditional settings. Its fruit produces a small amount of oil, which has been historically used for various purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is less economically significant compared to other oil palms like Elaeis guineensis.</p>
