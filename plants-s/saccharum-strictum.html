                    <h1>Saccharum strictum</h1>
<p>Saccharum strictum, commonly known as wild sugarcane, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences at the top of its stem. It is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>While not as economically valuable as cultivated sugarcane, it plays an important role in ecological systems and has some traditional uses.</p>
