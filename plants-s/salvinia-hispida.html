<p>Salvinia hispida, commonly known as the hispid watermoss, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, feathery fronds that are covered in tiny, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include spores, which are dispersed by water currents.</p>
