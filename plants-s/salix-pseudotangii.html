                    <h1>Salix pseudotangii</h1>
<p>Salix pseudotangii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
