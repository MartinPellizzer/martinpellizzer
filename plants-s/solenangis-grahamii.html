<p>Solenangis grahamii, commonly known as Graham's solenangis, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators such as moths and beetles. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solenangis grahamii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
