                    <h1>Sagina virginica</h1>
<p>Sagina virginica, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>
