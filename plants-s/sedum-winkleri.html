<p>Sedum winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Sedum winkleri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
