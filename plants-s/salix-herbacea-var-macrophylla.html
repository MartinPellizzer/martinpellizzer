<p>Salix herbacea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often wetland environments. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a rough texture, with a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas.</p>
