                    <h1>Selenipedium × finetianum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × finetianum, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with pendant flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant is a hybrid between Selenipedium albidum and Selenipedium macdougallii, and it exhibits a unique combination of traits from both parent species. It requires a humid, shaded environment with well-draining soil to thrive, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Selenipedium × finetianum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
