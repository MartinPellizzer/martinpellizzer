                    <h1>Salix oreinoma</h1>
<p>Salix oreinoma, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. Salix oreinoma is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
