<p>Sedum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, erect or spreading stems and small, often clustered leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environments.</p>
