                    <h1>Soredium</h1>
<p>Soredium, commonly known as a type of vegetative propagule in lichens, consists of a cluster of algal cells surrounded by fungal hyphae.</p>
<p>It is a unique structure that allows lichens to reproduce asexually through dispersion by wind, water, or animals. Soredia are typically found in the thallus of crustose or foliose lichens and are often released in small, dust-like particles. These structures are crucial for the survival and spread of lichens in various environments.</p>
<p>The formation of soredia is a result of the symbiotic relationship between the fungal and algal components of the lichen.</p>
