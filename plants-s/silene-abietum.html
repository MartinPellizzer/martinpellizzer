<p>Silene abietum, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Silene abietum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
