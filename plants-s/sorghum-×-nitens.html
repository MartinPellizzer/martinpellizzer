                    <h1>Sorghum × nitens</h1>
<p>Sorghum × nitens, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from sorghum and nitens.</p>
<p>It is a tall, warm-season grass with strong stem and leaf structures, making it suitable for forage and erosion control. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sorghum × nitens is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils with moderate to high sunlight exposure.</p>
