<p>Salix alba var. glaucescens, commonly known as the white willow with a bluish tinge, is a variant of the white willow native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that often have a bluish or silvery hue on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is typically found in moist, often riparian habitats. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
