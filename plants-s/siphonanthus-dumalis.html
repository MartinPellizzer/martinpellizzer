<p>Siphonanthus dumalis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers produce a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Siphonanthus.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
