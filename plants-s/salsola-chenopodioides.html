                    <h1>Salsola chenopodioides</h1>
<p>Salsola chenopodioides, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with small, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and saline environments due to its deep root system and succulent stems. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Salsola chenopodioides is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
