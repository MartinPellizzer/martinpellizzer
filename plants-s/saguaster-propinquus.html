                <h1>Saguaster propinquus</h1>
<p>Saguaster propinquus, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are erect and can grow up to several feet in height.</p>
<p>Saguaster propinquus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>
