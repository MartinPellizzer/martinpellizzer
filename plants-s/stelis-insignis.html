<p>Stelis insignis, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis insignis thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
