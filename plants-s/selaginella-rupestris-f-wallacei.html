                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. wallacei</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered at the tips of its branching stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
