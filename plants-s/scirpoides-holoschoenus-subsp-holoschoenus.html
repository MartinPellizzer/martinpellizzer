<p>Scirpoides holoschoenus subsp.</p>
<p>holoschoenus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense stands, and its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the margins of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
