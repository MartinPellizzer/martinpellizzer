                    <h1>Sambucus cerulea var. glabra</h1>
<p>Sambucus cerulea var. glabra, commonly known as dwarf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems and alternate, compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity when unripe.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, woodland conditions.</p>
