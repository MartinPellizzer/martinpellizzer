<p>Selliguea digitata, commonly known as the star moss, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its intricate, branching structure and small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its appearance resembles a star due to the radiating pattern of its lobes, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Selliguea digitata plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
