<p>Saussurea trullifolia, commonly known as the Alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower heads that are surrounded by pale blue or white bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
