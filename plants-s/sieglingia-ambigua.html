<p>Sieglingia ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous sieglingia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sieglingia ambigua is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests.</p>
