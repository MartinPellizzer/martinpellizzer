                    <h1>Senites</h1>
<p>Senites, commonly known as stonecrops, are succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Senites typically have a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or rosettes. Many species are found in rocky or gravelly soils, where they can tolerate poor nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Their ability to survive in harsh climates makes them popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
