<p>Stevia tapacariensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, which appear in late spring.</p>
<p>Stevia tapacariensis is valued for its natural sweetening properties and is used in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute.</p>
