                    <h1>Strigilia racemosa</h1>
<p>Strigilia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants, making it a temporary and elusive species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Strigilia racemosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a rare plant in many regions.</p>
