<p>Sporobolus melleri, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand prolonged drought.</p>
<p>Sporobolus melleri is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
