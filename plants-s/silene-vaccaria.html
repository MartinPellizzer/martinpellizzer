                    <h1>Silene vaccaria</h1>
<p>Silene vaccaria, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Silene vaccaria is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
