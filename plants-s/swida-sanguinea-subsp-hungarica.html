<p>Swida sanguinea subsp.</p>
<p>hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian red willow, is a rare subspecies native to parts of Central Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its reddish-brown bark and elongated, willow-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting and ecologically significant species.</p>
