<p>Saxifraga cernua var. exilioides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
