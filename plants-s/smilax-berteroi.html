<p>Smilax berteroi, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a perennial climbing shrub native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem with sharp, spiny projections, which help it to cling to trees and other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are initially green and turn red when ripe, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Smilax berteroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
