                    <h1>Stipa rhizomata</h1>
<p>Stipa rhizomata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It forms dense, clump-like tufts or tussocks, which help it thrive in various grassland and steppe environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation and contribute to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Stipa rhizomata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion.</p>
