                    <h1>Sequoia</h1>
<p>Sequoia, commonly known as the giant redwood, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Taxodiaceae family and is characterized by its massive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet. The sequoia's bark is thick and fibrous, providing natural protection against fire and pests. Its cones produce seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>These ancient trees can live for thousands of years, making them one of the longest-living organisms on Earth.</p>
