                    <h1>Scorodosma foetidum</h1>
<p>Scorodosma foetidum, commonly known as the stinking bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or root in the mud. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the bladders are often positioned at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Scorodosma foetidum is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which helps deter herbivores from feeding on it.</p>
