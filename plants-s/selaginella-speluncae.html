                    <h1>Selaginella speluncae</h1>
<p>Selaginella speluncae, commonly known as the cave spikemoss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant native to subterranean environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in dark, humid caves, where it relies on dim light from fissures or bioluminescent fungi for photosynthesis. The plant has adapted to low-light conditions with reduced leaf size and elongated stems. Its sporophyte stage is particularly well-developed, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Selaginella speluncae plays a unique ecological role in cave ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting specialized microfauna.</p>
