                    <h1>Smilax sylvatica</h1>
<p>Smilax sylvatica, commonly known as greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red berries, which are a food source for various birds and mammals. Smilax sylvatica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth habit makes it both a valuable ecological component and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
