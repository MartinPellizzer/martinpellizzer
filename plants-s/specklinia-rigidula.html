<p>Specklinia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Specklinia rigidula thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.</p>
