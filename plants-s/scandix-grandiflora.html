<p>Scandix grandiflora, commonly known as the giant water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant produces showy, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>Scandix grandiflora plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
