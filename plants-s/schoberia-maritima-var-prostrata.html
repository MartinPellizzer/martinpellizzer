                    <h1>Schoberia maritima var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Schoberia maritima var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sea spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
