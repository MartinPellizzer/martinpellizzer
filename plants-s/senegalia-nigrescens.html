<p>Senegalia nigrescens, commonly known as blackbrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that turn a dark green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. Senegalia nigrescens is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species.</p>
