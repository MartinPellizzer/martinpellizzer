<p>Symphysodaphne cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban symphysodaphne, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the bottom. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging from the water surface in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and invasive species.</p>
