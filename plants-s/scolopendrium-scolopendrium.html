<p>Scolopendrium scolopendrium, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It is well adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Scolopendrium scolopendrium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
