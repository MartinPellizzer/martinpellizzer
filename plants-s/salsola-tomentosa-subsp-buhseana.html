<p>Salsola tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>buhseana, commonly known as silver saxifrage, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an adaptive and resilient species in extreme climates.</p>
