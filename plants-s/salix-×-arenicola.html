                    <h1>Salix × arenicola</h1>
<p>Salix × arenicola, commonly known as the sand willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and flexible branches that are well adapted to withstand strong winds and limited water availability. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its root system is extensive and helps prevent soil erosion in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Salix × arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
