<p>Styrax tepuiensis subsp.</p>
<p>huachamacarii, commonly known as the Huachamacarii styrax, is a rare and endemic species native to the tepuis of northern South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Styracaceae family. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
