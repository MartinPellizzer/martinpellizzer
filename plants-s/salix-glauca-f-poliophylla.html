                    <h1>Salix glauca f. poliophylla</h1>
<p>Salix glauca f. poliophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a rare and distinctive variant of the gray willow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Salix glauca. This form typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, preferring clay soils. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are essential for its reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
