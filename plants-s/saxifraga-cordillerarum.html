<p>Saxifraga cordillerarum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga cordillerarum is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous terrain.</p>
