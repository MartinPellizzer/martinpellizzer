                    <h1>Sideroxylon anomalum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon anomalum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, Sideroxylon anomalum is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
