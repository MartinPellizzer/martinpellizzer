                    <h1>Salsola arborescens var. richteri</h1>
<p>Salsola arborescens var. richteri, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its adaptations include deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion.</p>
