                    <h1>Stapelia obducta</h1>
<p>Stapelia obducta, commonly known as the naked stem stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique, almost stem-like appearance.</p>
<p>Stapelia obducta is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and requiring minimal care once established.</p>
