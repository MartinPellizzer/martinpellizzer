                    <h1>Salsola buhseana</h1>
<p>Salsola buhseana, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by clusters of dry, wind-dispersed seeds. Salsola buhseana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
