The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to crops. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is considered a major agricultural pest due to its impact on cereal crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
