<p>Salix × arikae, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a hybrid species native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often riparian environments. The plant features slender, often multi-stemmed branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures.</p>
