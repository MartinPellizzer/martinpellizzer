                            <h1>Seriphium Rhinocerotis</h1>
<p>Seriphium rhinocerotis, also known as the horned evening-primrose, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. This plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths and beetles. Its name comes from the distinctive horn-like structures on its seed pods, which resemble the shape of a rhinoceros horn. Thriving in rocky soils and dry climates, it plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its subtle presence in harsh environments.</p>
