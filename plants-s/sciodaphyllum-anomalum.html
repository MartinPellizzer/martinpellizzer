                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum anomalum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum anomalum, commonly known as the ghost pine, is a rare and enigmatic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of ghostly, translucent structures. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and has a distinctive, twisted trunk that often appears stunted or gnarled. Its cones are small and often obscured by the dense foliage, making them difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum anomalum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
