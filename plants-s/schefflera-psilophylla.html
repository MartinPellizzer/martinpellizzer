                    <h1>Schefflera psilophylla</h1>
<p>Schefflera psilophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that are relatively small and narrow compared to other schefflera species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
