<p>Saxifraga petraea var. bellardii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a powdery blue or white coating, known as a farina. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or violet, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize barren, rocky areas makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
