<p>Salvia cryptanthos, commonly known as the cryptanthus sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mounding growth habit and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant produces showy flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-blue hue that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Salvia cryptanthos is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
