<p>Setaria sphacelata subsp.</p>
<p>nodosa, commonly known as nodose beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, thread-like blades that often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-based flowers. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and grassland ecosystems.</p>
