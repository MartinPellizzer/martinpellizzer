                    <h1>Spiranthes umbraticola</h1>
<p>Spiranthes umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowy spiral orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and swampy areas. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific conservation efforts to survive.</p>
