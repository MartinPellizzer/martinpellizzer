<p>Synaedrys shinsuiensis, commonly known as the Shinsui Island fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Shinsui in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor but important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
