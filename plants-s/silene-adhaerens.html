<p>Silene adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Silene adhaerens is an annual or biennial species, and its sticky secretions have been studied for their potential ecological and medicinal uses.</p>
