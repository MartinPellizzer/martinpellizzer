<p>Sisymbrium teres, commonly known as narrowleaf broomrape, is an annual parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops like wheat and barley.</p>
