<p>Sericostoma calcareum, commonly known as the calcareous sericostoma, is a species of liverwort found in moist, calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, crust-like thallus that adheres to rocky or soil surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy cells. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in areas with high humidity and low light conditions.</p>
<p>Sericostoma calcareum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates.</p>
