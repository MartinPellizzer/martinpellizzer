<p>Sorbus lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow or red in autumn.</p>
<p>Sorbus lanuginosa is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
