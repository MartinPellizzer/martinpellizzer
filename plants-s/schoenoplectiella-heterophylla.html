<p>Schoenoplectiella heterophylla, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to fluctuating water levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectiella heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
