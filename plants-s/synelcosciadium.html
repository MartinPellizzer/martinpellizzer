<p>Synelcosciadium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers bloom only during the night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme habitat requirements and limited distribution, Synelcosciadium is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
