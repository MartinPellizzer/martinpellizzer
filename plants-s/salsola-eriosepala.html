<p>Salsola eriosepala, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bead-like fruits. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Salsola eriosepala plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
