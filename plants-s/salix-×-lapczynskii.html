                    <h1>Salix × lapczynskii</h1>
<p>Salix × lapczynskii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra, characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
