<p>Silene viscosa, commonly known as sticky willow or sticky sedgewood, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in glandular hairs that produce a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Silene viscosa is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed soils or rocky areas.</p>
