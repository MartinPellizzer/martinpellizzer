<p>Saxifraga tridactylites subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is often found in alpine tundra and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
