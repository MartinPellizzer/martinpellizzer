<p>Stipa pennata var. breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, silver-green inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscape designs.</p>
<p>The variety breviglumis is distinguished by its shorter glumes compared to the typical form of S. pennata.</p>
