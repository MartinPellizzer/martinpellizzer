<p>Stipa austroitalica subsp.</p>
<p>frentana, commonly known as the Frentana needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant bears small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>
