                    <h1>Symphyotrichum gypsophilum</h1>
<p>Symphyotrichum gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas, thriving in poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its association with gypsum soils, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
