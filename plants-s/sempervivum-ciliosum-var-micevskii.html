<p>Sempervivum ciliosum var. micevskii, commonly known as the Mousevsky's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive grayish-blue hue and white-tipped margins. The leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
