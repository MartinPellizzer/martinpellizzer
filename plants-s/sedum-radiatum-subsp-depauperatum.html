<p>Sedum radiatum subsp.</p>
<p>depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted for water storage and reducing transpiration.</p>

<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
