<p>Saxifraga oresbia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer. Saxifraga oresbia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
