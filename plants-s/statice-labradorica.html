<p>Statice labradorica, commonly known as Labrador glassweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, papery blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Statice labradorica is an important component of tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
