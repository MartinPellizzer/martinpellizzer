                    <h1>Sempervivum pittonii</h1>
<p>Sempervivum pittonii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and surrounding mountain regions.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value.</p>
