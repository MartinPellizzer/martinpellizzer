<p>Stapelia reticulata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a dark center, resembling decaying flesh. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Stapelia reticulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
