<p>Selinum schiwerekii, commonly known as the Schiwerek's garlic chives, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
