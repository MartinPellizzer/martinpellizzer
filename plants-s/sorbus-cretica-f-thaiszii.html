<p>Sorbus cretica f. thaiszii, commonly known as the Thaiszii rowan, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common whitebeam.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that appear in spring. Its fruit is a small, red or orange berry that matures in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species.</p>
