                    <h1>Strigilia pohlii</h1>
<p>Strigilia pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, slender leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure, often covering rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in arid environments, making it an important species for erosion control.</p>
<p>Strigilia pohlii is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats.</p>
