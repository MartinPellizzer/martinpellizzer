<p>Spergularia canadensis subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as western sandspurry, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
