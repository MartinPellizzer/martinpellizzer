<p>Selaginella praetermissa, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Selaginella praetermissa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
