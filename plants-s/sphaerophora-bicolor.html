                    <h1>Sphaerophora bicolor</h1>
<p>Sphaerophora bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sand fly, is a species of midge belonging to the family Psychodidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate body and distinctive two-colored wings, typically with a dark and a light band. The plant is not a true plant but an insect, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense. However, it is often found in sandy or moist soil environments, which are important for its life cycle.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate specific ecological conditions in its habitat.</p>
