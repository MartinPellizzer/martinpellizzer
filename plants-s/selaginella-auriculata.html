                    <h1>Selaginella auriculata</h1>
<p>Selaginella auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped spikemoss, is a low-growing fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with whorls of spirally arranged leaves that are often auriculate, or ear-shaped, at the base. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in diverse habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
