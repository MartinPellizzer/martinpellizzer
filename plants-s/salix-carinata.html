                    <h1>Salix carinata</h1>
<p>Salix carinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salix carinata is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
