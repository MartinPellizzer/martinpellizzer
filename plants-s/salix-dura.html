                    <h1>Salix dura</h1>
<p>Salix dura, commonly known as the hard willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to drought and damage.</p>
<p>Salix dura is adapted to harsh environments, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
