                    <h1>Selaginella geniculata</h1>
<p>Selaginella geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its unique, branching stems that form a dense, cushion-like structure.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a primitive form of vascular tissue, which allows it to retain water and nutrients more efficiently than non-vascular plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Selaginella geniculata is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in certain habitats.</p>
