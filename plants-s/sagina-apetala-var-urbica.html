                    <h1>Sagina apetala var. urbica</h1>
<p>Sagina apetala var. urbica, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in urban environments, hence its common name. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
