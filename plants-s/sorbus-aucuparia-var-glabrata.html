                    <h1>Sorbus aucuparia var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Sorbus aucuparia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other rowan species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges.</p>
<p>The smooth rowan is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
