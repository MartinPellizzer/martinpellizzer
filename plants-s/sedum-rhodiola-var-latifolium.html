<p>Sedum rhodiola var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in summer. Its growth habit is low and mat-forming, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
