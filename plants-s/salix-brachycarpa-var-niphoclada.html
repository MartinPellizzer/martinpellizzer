                    <h1>Salix brachycarpa var. niphoclada</h1>
<p>Salix brachycarpa var. niphoclada, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its bark is typically grayish and may have a fibrous texture.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, alpine soils where few other plants can survive.</p>
