<p>Scirpus junghuhnii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
