<p>Scirpus longii, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like structures, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Scirpus longii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soil conditions.</p>
