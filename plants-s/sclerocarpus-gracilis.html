                    <h1>Sclerocarpus gracilis</h1>
<p>Sclerocarpus gracilis, commonly known as the slender burr plant, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, a trait typical of the carrot family. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene that is often covered in a hairy layer, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Sclerocarpus gracilis is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
