                    <h1>Sitobolium flaccidum</h1>
<p>Sitobolium flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on photosynthetic hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its subterranean growth habit. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that attach to the roots of host plants, forming a symbiotic relationship that can impact crop growth.</p>
