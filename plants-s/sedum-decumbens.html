<p>Sedum decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spreading stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Sedum decumbens is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
