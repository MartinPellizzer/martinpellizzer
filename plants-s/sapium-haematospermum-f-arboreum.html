<p>Sapium haematospermum f. arboreum, commonly known as the redseed Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive red, woody fruits containing seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage and unique seed pods.</p>
