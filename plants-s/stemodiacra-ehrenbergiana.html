                    <h1>Stemodiacra ehrenbergiana</h1>
<p>Stemodiacra ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a species of cactus native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem that is often covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rainfalls.</p>
<p>Overall, Stemodiacra ehrenbergiana is well-suited to harsh desert environments, showcasing efficient adaptations for survival in low-water conditions.</p>
