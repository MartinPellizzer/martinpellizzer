                    <h1>Sarothamnus scoparius var. andreanus</h1>
<p>Sarothamnus scoparius var. andreanus, commonly known as the Algerian thornbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small needle-like leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The variety andreanus is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Sarothamnus scoparius.</p>
