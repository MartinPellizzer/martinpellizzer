<p>Saxifraga sphaeroidea, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths with tightly packed, rounded leaves that help insulate it from harsh cold and wind. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga sphaeroidea thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountain habitats.</p>
