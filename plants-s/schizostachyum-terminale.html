<p>Schizostachyum terminale, commonly known as the African bamboo, is a tall, woody grass native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
