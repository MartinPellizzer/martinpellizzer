                    <h1>Straussia pubiflora</h1>
<p>Straussia pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered straussia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, pubescent leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its succulent foliage and ability to store water make it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Straussia pubiflora is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
