<p>Stipa saltensis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Stipa saltensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
