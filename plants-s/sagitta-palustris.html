                    <h1>Sagitta palustris</h1>
<p>Sagitta palustris, commonly known as the marsh arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Sagitta palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
