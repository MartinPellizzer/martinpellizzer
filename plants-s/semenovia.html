<p>Semenovia, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Semenovia species are characterized by their unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many Semenovia species are considered endangered.</p>
