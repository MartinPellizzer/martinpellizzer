The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider webs. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis tsubotae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure.</p>
