                    <h1>Saxifraga flexuosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga flexuosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
