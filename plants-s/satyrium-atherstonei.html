<p>Satyrium atherstonei, commonly known as the Atherstone's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the limestone grasslands of southern England.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often in areas with a history of grazing. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
