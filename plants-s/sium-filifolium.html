                    <h1>Sium filifolium</h1>
<p>Sium filifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and stream banks in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is often harvested for culinary use, though it can be toxic if not prepared properly.</p>
<p>Sium filifolium plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
