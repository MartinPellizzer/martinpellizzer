<p>Salsola verrucosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain water in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Salsola verrucosa is often used in traditional medicine and can also be a source of forage for livestock in certain regions.</p>
