                    <h1>Setaria geminata var. paludivaga</h1>
<p>Setaria geminata var. paludivaga, commonly known as the narrowleaf foxtail, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bristly spikelets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other Setaria species due to its similar morphology.</p>
