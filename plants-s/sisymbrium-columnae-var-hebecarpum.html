                    <h1>Sisymbrium columnae var. hebecarpum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium columnae var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, often scale-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds with a distinctive, hooked beak. It typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
