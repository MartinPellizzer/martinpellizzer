                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera var. villigremma</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera var. villigremma, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Saxifraga globulifera.</p>
