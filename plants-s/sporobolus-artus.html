                    <h1>Sporobolus artus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus artus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Sporobolus artus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
