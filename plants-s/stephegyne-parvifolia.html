                    <h1>Stephegyne parvifolia</h1>
<p>Stephegyne parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically small and velvety in texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a living fence.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its aggressive spreading nature.</p>
