                    <h1>Satyrium cordifolium</h1>
<p>Satyrium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in its nutrient uptake.</p>
