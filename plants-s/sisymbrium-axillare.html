                    <h1>Sisymbrium axillare</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium axillare, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
