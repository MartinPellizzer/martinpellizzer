                    <h1>Steffensia</h1>
<p>Steffensia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and succulent leaves. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>Steffensia is adapted to poor soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
