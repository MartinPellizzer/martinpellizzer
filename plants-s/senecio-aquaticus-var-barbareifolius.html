                    <h1>Senecio aquaticus var. barbareifolius</h1>
<p>Senecio aquaticus var. barbareifolius, commonly known as waterleaf or water lettuce, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
