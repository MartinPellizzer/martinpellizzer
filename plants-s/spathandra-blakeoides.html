<p>Spathandra blakeoides, commonly known as the Blake's spathandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered around the central spadix, with the showy spathe serving as an attractant for pollinators. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Spathandra blakeoides is considered endangered and is often found in protected wetland areas.</p>
