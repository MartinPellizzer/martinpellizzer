                    <h1>Setaria sphacelata var. sericea</h1>
<p>Setaria sphacelata var. sericea, commonly known as silky foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bristly, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
