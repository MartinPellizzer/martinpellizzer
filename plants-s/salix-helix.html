<p>Salix helix, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwest Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall before shedding. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds.</p>
