                    <h1>Synaedrys pallida</h1>
<p>Synaedrys pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Synaedrys pallida is listed as an endangered species.</p>
