                    <h1>Sagittaria obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Sagittaria obtusifolia, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface or emerge from the water, with narrow, grass-like leaves submerged beneath. Its small white flowers appear in spikes above the water, and it produces berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Sagittaria obtusifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability.</p>
