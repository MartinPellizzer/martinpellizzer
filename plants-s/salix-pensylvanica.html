                    <h1>Salix pensylvanica</h1>
<p>Salix pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other riparian areas. The plant has slender, flexible stems that often trail along the ground or form dense clumps. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania willow produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
