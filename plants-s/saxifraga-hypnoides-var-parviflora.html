                    <h1>Saxifraga hypnoides var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hypnoides var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
