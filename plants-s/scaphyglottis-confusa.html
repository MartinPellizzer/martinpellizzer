                    <h1>Scaphyglottis confusa</h1>
<p>Scaphyglottis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Scaphyglottis confusa is highly sought after in conservation efforts.</p>
