<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time.</p>
