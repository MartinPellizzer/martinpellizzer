                    <h1>Saxifraga × ignota</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × ignota, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, Saxifraga × ignota is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists.</p>
