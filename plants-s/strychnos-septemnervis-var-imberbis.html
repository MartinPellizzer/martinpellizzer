                    <h1>Strychnos septemnervis var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Strychnos septemnervis var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless seven-veined strychnos, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that lack the hairy texture found in the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
