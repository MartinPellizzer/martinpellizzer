<p>Sopubia laxior, commonly known as the woolly spongeplant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sopubia laxior is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
