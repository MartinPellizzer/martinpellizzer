                    <h1>Sium patulum</h1>
<p>Sium patulum, commonly known as broad-leaved water-plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Sium patulum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and contributing to water filtration.</p>
