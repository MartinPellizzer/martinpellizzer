<p>Stelis eudialema, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Stelis, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a yellow or green lip. Its roots are adapted to grow on trees, anchoring it to bark while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Stelis eudialema thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
