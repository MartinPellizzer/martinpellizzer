<p>Schedonorus lividus, commonly known as the silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its alpine habitat. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes.</p>
<p>Schedonorus lividus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics.</p>
