                    <h1>Selliguea okamotoi</h1>
<p>Selliguea okamotoi, commonly known as the Okamoto's rock moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found on rocky substrates in humid environments. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It is primarily distributed in Southeast Asia, particularly in regions with high rainfall and shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Selliguea okamotoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystems.</p>
