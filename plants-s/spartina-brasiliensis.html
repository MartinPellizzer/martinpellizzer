                    <h1>Spartina brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Spartina brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, grass-like blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which stabilize sediments and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Spartina brasiliensis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
