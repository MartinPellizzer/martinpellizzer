                <h1>Sitobolium smithii</h1>
<p>Sitobolium smithii, commonly known as the Smith's sitobolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive leaf structures and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow blooms during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
