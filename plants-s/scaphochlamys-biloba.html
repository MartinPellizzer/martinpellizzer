                    <h1>Scaphochlamys biloba</h1>
<p>Scaphochlamys biloba, commonly known as the two-valved bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes slender, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Scaphochlamys biloba is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic ecosystems and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
