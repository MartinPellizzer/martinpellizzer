Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat.</p>
