<p>Sporobolus modestus, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Sporobolus modestus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
