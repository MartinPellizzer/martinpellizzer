<p>Scirpus falsus, commonly known as false bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects.</p>
