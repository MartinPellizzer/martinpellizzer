                    <h1>Scirpus eriophorum var. nipponicum</h1>
<p>Scirpus eriophorum var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in wetland habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
