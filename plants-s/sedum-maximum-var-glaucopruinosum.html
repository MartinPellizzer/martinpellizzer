<p>Sedum maximum var. glaucopruinosum, commonly known as the silver-stem sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a distinctive silvery-blue waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
