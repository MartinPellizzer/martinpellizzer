<p>Sarcostemma aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless milkweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern and eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a notable feature of its botanical makeup.</p>
<p>Sarcostemma aphyllum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils or in dry woodlands.</p>
