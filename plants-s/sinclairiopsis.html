<p>Sinclairiopsis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants typically have smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are often succulent to store water. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Sinclairiopsis species are well adapted to harsh environments and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
