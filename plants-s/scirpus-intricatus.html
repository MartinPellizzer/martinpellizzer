<p>Scirpus intricatus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Scirpus intricatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
