<p>Salix gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
