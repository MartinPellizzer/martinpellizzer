<p>Sedum × erraticum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sedum × erraticum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
