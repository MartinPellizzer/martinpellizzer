<p>Salix × hayatana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Salix discolor and Salix amygdaloides, resulting in a plant with distinctive features combining traits from both parents. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, and its flexible branches make it suitable for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist soils and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
