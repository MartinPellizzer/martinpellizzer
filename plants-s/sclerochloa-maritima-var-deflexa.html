                    <h1>Sclerochloa maritima var. deflexa</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa maritima var. deflexa, commonly known as the bentleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or folded, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to withstand high salinity and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
