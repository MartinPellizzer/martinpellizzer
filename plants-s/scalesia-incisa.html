                    <h1>Scalesia incisa</h1>
<p>Scalesia incisa, commonly known as the endemic tree of the Galápagos Islands, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellow-orange capitula that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in the humid, coastal environments of the Galápagos, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Scalesia incisa is also notable for its role in the evolution of reproductive strategies in island flora.</p>
