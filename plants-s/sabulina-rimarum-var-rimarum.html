                    <h1>Sabulina rimarum var. rimarum</h1>
<p>Sabulina rimarum var. rimarum, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is typically found in dunes or along the edges of tidal zones. The plant has small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
