                    <h1>Spathiphyllum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Spathiphyllum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf peace lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular houseplant. The plant produces small, white spathes that enclose its true flowers, which are typically hidden and not as showy as the spathe. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Spathiphyllum pygmaeum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to indoor air quality.</p>
