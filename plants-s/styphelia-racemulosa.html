<p>Styphelia racemulosa, commonly known as the heath or the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often harsh environment.</p>
<p>Styphelia racemulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar soil conditions.</p>
