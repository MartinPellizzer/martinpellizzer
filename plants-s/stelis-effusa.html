<p>Stelis effusa, commonly known as the spreading stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis effusa is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
