                    <h1>Salix × canthiana</h1>
<p>Salix × canthiana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The weeping willow is often planted for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve soil quality.</p>
