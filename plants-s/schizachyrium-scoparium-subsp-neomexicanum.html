<p>Schizachyrium scoparium subsp.</p>
<p>neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico sideblades, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and taller growth compared to the typical form of Schizachyrium scoparium.</p>
