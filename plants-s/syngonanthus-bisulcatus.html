<p>Syngonanthus bisulcatus, commonly known as the two-ridged sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and possesses small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Syngonanthus bisulcatus is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
