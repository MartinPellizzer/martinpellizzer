                    <h1>Symphyotrichum hintonii</h1>
<p>Symphyotrichum hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's Newcomb's aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodland edges and meadows, and it has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. It produces small, oval fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Symphyotrichum hintonii is often found in association with other native wildflowers, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
