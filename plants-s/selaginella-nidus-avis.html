                    <h1>Selaginella nidus-avis</h1>
<p>Selaginella nidus-avis, commonly known as the basket fern or resurrection plant, is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the Selaginellaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when dry and reviving when rehydrated, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with leaves that curl into a tight bundle, resembling a basket. Its sporophytes are typically small and clustered at the base of the plant, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Native to arid and semi-arid regions, Selaginella nidus-avis is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices where it can retain moisture.</p>
