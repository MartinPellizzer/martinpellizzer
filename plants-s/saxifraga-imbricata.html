                    <h1>Saxifraga imbricata</h1>
<p>Saxifraga imbricata, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Its leaves are usually oval or spoon-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga imbricata is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
