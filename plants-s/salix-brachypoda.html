                    <h1>Salix brachypoda</h1>
<p>Salix brachypoda, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its role in early succession ecosystems. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, making it an important species for stabilizing riparian areas.</p>
<p>Salix brachypoda is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
