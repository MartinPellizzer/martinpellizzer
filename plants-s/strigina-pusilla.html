<p>Strigina pusilla, commonly known as the small sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, thread-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
