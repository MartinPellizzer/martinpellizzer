<p>Seruneum frutescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
