                    <h1>Scirpus sylvaticus var. microcarpus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sylvaticus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Scirpus species.</p>
