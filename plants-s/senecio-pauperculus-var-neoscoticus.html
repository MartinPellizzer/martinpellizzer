<p>Senecio pauperculus var. neoscoticus, commonly known as the Neoscotic groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact form and unique floral characteristics compared to other Senecio species.</p>
