<p>Scirpus conifer, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, needle-like leaves, which give it a conifer-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Scirpus conifer plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
