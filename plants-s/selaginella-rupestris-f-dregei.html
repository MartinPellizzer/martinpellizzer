                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. dregei</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. dregei, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a vulnerable species.</p>
