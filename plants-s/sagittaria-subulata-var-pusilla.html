<p>Sagittaria subulata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a spike, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
