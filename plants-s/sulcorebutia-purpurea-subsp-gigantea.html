<p>Sulcorebutia purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>gigantea, commonly known as the giant purple crassula, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a reddish or purple tinge, especially under direct sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
