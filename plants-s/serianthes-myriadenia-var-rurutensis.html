<p>Serianthes myriadenia var. rurutensis, commonly known as the RurutÃ© tree, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, the species is considered critically endangered.</p>
