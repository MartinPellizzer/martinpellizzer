                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. sartorii</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. sartorii, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern ally native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers shady, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its short, creeping stems. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
