<p>Selaginella buchholzii, commonly known as the Buchholz's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and seeds, which is uncommon among mosses. Its rhizomes are often clustered, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Selaginella buchholzii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
