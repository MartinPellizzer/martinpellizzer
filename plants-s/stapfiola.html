                    <h1>Stapfiola</h1>
<p>Stapfiola, commonly known as the "Stapf's orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. Stapfiola species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, rather than in soil. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers with intricate patterns and colors that range from white to violet.</p>
<p>The genus is named after the botanist Friedrich Stapf, who made significant contributions to the study of African flora.</p>
