<p>Scirpus wallrothii, commonly known as the wallroth's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it an important colonizer of disturbed wetland areas.</p>
<p>Scirpus wallrothii plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
