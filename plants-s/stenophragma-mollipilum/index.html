                            <h1>Stenophragma Mollipilum</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Stenophragma mollipilum, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is celebrated for its ethereal blue-gray foliage and fluffy, mist-like blooms that appear in late summer. This hardy plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and natural landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements have earned it a place in both ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture. With its ability to attract pollinators and support local wildlife, the Blue mistflower plays a vital role in sustaining biodiversity.</p>
