<p>Salix aurita f. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow or narrow-leaf willow, is a variant of the willow species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, where it thrives in wet or semi-aquatic conditions. Its catkins are an important feature, producing both male and female flowers in separate clusters.</p>
<p>This willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
