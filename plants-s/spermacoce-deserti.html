<p>Spermacoce deserti, commonly known as the desert sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss.

<p>Spermacoce deserti is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
