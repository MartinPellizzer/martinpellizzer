<p>Scirpus chinensis var. siamensis, commonly known as the Siam bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus chinensis var. siamensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and as a source of traditional materials in some regions.</p>
