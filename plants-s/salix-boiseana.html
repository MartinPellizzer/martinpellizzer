                    <h1>Salix boiseana</h1>
<p>Salix boiseana, commonly known as the Boise willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. It has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to flooding but adaptable to various wetland environments.</p>
<p>The Boise willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
