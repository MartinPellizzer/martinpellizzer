                    <h1>Salsola ferox</h1>
<p>Salsola ferox, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and disturbed environments due to its deep root system and efficient water use. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Salsola ferox is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but also plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
