                    <h1>Stromatocactus kotschoubeyi</h1>
<p>Stromatocactus kotschoubeyi, commonly known as the "Candelabra Cactus," is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into multiple cylindrical stems, resembling a candelabra. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Stromatocactus kotschoubeyi is also noted for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
