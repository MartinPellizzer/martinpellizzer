<p>Stenotus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The genus includes several species, such as Stenotus ciliatus and Stenotus obovatus, which are often found in rocky soils and dry habitats.</p>
