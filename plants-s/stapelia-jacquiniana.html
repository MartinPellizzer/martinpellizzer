                    <h1>Stapelia jacquiniana</h1>
<p>Stapelia jacquiniana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and lack of traditional leaves, which are replaced by modified structures called phylloclades. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom in summer and are adapted to attract specific pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
