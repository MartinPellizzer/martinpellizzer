<p>Salsola recurva, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Salsola recurva is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
