                    <h1>Smilax opaca</h1>
<p>Smilax opaca, commonly known as the common smilax, is a woody perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and produces stout, thorny stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it bears small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilax opaca is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its persistent foliage and berries make it a notable component of the understory in native plant communities.</p>
