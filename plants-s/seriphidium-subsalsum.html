<p>Seriphidium subsalsum, commonly known as the saltbush or desert sandthrift, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Seriphidium subsalsum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
