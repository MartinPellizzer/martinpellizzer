<p>Syzygium claviflorum subsp.</p>
<p>tavaiense, commonly known as the Tavai rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid lowland forests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It is valued for its hard, heavy timber, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
