<p>Schizoloma jamesonioides, commonly known as the Jameson's lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, granular lower surface. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together carry out photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
