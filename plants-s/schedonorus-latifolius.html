                    <h1>Schedonorus latifolius</h1>
<p>Schedonorus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures.</p>
