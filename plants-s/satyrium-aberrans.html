                    <h1>Satyrium aberrans</h1>
<p>Satyrium aberrans, commonly known as the pale marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along riverbanks. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves and a single, showy, pale pink or white flower. Its morphology is adapted to its wetland environment, with specialized root systems for nutrient uptake in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>The species is considered rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status.</p>
