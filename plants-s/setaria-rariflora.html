<p>Setaria rariflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
