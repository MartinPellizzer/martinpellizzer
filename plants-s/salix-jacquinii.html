<p>Salix jacquinii, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Salix jacquinii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
