                    <h1>Scutellaria alpina var. pumila</h1>
<p>Scutellaria alpina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a mat-forming habit that allows it to thrive in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Scutellaria alpina var. pumila is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
