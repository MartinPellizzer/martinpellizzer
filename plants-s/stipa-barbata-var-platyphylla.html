                    <h1>Stipa barbata var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Stipa barbata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved feathergrass, is a variant of the feathergrass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, wide leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical *S. barbata*. The plant produces slender, branched inflorescences composed of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
