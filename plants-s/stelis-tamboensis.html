<p>Stelis tamboensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually green and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Stelis tamboensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
