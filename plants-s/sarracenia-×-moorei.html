<p>Sarracenia × moorei, commonly known as the red-tipped pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's vibrant red coloration, especially on the inner surface of the pitchers, serves as an attractant for prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light to flourish.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × moorei is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its aesthetic appeal and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
