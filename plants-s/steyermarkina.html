                    <h1>Steyermarkina</h1>
<p>Steyermarkina, commonly known as the Steyermark's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on the branches of hardwood trees, such as oaks and hickories, in the southeastern United States. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while photosynthesis occurs through its own leaves.</p>
<p>Steyermarkina plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
