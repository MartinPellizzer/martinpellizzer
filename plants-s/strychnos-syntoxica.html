                    <h1>Strychnos syntoxica</h1>
<p>Strychnos syntoxica, commonly known as the poison gooseberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of strychnine and brucine. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Its toxic properties make it a subject of both botanical study and caution in regions where it grows naturally.</p>
