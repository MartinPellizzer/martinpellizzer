                <h1>Spinifex littoreus</h1>
<p>Spinifex littoreus, commonly known as beach spinifex, is a hardy perennial grass that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This plant is a key component of coastal dune ecosystems, helping to stabilize sand and prevent erosion. Its fibrous roots form a mat that anchors the dunes and supports other plant life.</p>
<p>Spinifex littoreus is also valued for its ability to recover quickly after disturbances such as storms or human activity.</p>
