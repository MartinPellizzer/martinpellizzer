                    <h1>Selaginella polycephala</h1>
<p>Selaginella polycephala, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spore-producing organs. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte phase, typical of bryophyte-like reproduction in vascular plants.</p>
<p>Selaginella polycephala plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
