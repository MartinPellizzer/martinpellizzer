<p>Saxifraga granulata subsp.</p>
<p>graeca, commonly known as the Greek saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and Turkey. It features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
