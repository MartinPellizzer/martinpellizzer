                    <h1>Schoenus multiglumis</h1>
<p>Schoenus multiglumis, commonly known as the many-barbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Schoenus multiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
