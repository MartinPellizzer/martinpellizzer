<p>Sorbus commixta var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
