                    <h1>Senecio chamaecephalus</h1>
<p>Senecio chamaecephalus, commonly known as the cushion senecio, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in heads and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
