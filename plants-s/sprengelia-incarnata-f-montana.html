<p>Sprengelia incarnata f. montana, commonly known as the Alpine Sprengelia, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from pink to red in color. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range.</p>
