                    <h1>Salix carpinifolia</h1>
<p>Salix carpinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, often boggy soils and is commonly found along stream banks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Salix carpinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
