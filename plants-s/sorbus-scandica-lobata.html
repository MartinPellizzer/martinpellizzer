                    <h1>Sorbus scandica lobata</h1>
<p>Sorbus scandica lobata, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
