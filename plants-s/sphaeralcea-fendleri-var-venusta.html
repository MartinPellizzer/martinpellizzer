<p>It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the late afternoon, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea fendleri var. venusta is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
