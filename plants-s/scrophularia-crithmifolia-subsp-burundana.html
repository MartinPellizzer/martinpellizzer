<p>Scrophularia crithmifolia subsp.</p>
<p>burundana, commonly known as Burundan scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Burundi and eastern Congo. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
