                    <h1>Spiesia aucheri</h1>
<p>Spiesia aucheri, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
