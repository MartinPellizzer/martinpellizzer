<p>Schismus barbatus subsp.</p>
<p>perennis, commonly known as the desert carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert environments.</p>
