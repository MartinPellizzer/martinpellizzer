<p>Setaria clivalis, commonly known as the cliff grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Setaria clivalis is often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
