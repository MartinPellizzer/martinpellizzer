                            <h1>Sedum Douglasii Var. Monanthum</h1>
<p>Douglas' sedum, scientifically known as Sedum douglasii var. monanthum, is a resilient perennial plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. This species is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in drought conditions with minimal care. Despite its hardiness, it remains a sought-after plant for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
