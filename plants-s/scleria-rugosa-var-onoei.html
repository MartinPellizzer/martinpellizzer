<p>Scleria rugosa var. onoei, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color.
