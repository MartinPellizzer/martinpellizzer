<p>Scirpus paracicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flowering spikes that emerge from water or moist soil. The plant thrives in shallow water or damp environments, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus paracicularis plays a vital role in supporting aquatic and avian life by providing habitat and food sources.</p>
