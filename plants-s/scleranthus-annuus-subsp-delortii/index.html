                            <h1>Scleranthus Annuus Subsp. Delortii</h1>
<p>Annual sickleweed, scientifically known as Scleranthus annuus subsp. delortii, is a resilient annual plant that thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive sickle-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Found primarily in the western United States, this subspecies is often overlooked despite its ecological importance. Its ability to colonize areas quickly makes it both a pioneer species and a potential weed. Understanding its biology and distribution helps in managing its impact on native plant communities.</p>
