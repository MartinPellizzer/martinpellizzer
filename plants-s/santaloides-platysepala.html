<p>Santaloides platysepala, commonly known as the flat-sepal sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat preferences, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
