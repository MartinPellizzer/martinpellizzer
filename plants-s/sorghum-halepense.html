                    <h1>Sorghum halepense</h1>
<p>Sorghum halepense, commonly known as Johnsongrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is highly invasive and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and adaptability, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world.</p>
