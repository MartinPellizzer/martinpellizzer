<p>Solanum indicum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by round, smooth, yellow or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
