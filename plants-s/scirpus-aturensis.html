<p>Scirpus aturensis, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. Scirpus aturensis thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
