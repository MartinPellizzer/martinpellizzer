                    <h1>Stipagrostis scoparia</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis scoparia, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipagrostis scoparia is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems and a potential candidate for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
