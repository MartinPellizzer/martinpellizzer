                    <h1>Sisyrinchium iridifolium</h1>
<p>Sisyrinchium iridifolium, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Sisyrinchium iridifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
