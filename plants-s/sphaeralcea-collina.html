                    <h1>Sphaeralcea collina</h1>
<p>Sphaeralcea collina, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in desert flora.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea collina is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability.</p>
