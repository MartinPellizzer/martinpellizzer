                    <h1>Saussurea amplifolia</h1>
<p>Saussurea amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf saffron plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, showy yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces numerous ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are broad and often have a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Saussurea amplifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
