<p>Stathmostelma stipitatum, commonly known as the black root moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, rhizoidal structures that anchor it to its moist, shaded habitat. The plant forms dense, carpet-like mats on rocks or soil, often found in temperate and subarctic regions. Its morphology includes small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a tight rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Stathmostelma stipitatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
