<p>Salix purpurea helix, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with a purplish hue. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, or in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix purpurea helix is smooth and light grey, with a fibrous texture that peels in thin layers.</p>
