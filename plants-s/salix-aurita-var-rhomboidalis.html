                    <h1>Salix aurita var. rhomboidalis</h1>
<p>Salix aurita var. rhomboidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
