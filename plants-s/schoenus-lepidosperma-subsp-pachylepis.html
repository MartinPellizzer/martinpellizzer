<p>Schoenus lepidosperma subsp.</p>
<p>pachylepis, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in areas with poor drainage.</p>
