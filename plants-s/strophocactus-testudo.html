<p>Strophocactus testudo, commonly known as the testudinaria cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Overall, Strophocactus testudo is a hardy, drought-tolerant cactus well adapted to desert environments.</p>
