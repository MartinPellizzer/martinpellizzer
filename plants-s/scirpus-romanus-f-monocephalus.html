                    <h1>Scirpus romanus f. monocephalus</h1>
<p>Scirpus romanus f. monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed bulrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the top of its stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinct single head of spikelets, differentiating it from other forms of Scirpus romanus.</p>
