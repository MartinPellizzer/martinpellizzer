                    <h1>Smilax santaremensis var. subarmata</h1>
<p>Smilax santaremensis var. subarmata, commonly known as the Santeramen subarmate smilax, is a species of climbing shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of spines, which are typical features of the Smilax genus. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
