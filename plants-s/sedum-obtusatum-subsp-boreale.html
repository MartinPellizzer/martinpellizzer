<p>Sedum obtusatum subsp.</p>
<p>boreale, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a perennial succulent native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
