                    <h1>Seruneum trichostephia</h1>
<p>Seruneum trichostephia, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Seruneum trichostephia is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
