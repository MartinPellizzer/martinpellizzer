                    <h1>Salix ovalifolia var. arctolitoralis</h1>
<p>Salix ovalifolia var. arctolitoralis, commonly known as the coastal willow, is a variant of the oval-leaf willow native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal environment. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is often found in areas with high salinity and wind exposure. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, contributing to its role in local pollination networks.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
