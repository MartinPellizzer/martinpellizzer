<p>Seruneum buphthalmodes, commonly known as the eye-of-the-crocodile, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, greenish-brown leaves that resemble the shape of a crocodile's eye. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Seruneum buphthalmodes is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
