                    <h1>Strelitzia reginae var. humilis</h1>
<p>Strelitzia reginae var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf orange bird-of-Paradise, is a striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its vivid orange and white inflorescences that resemble a bird in flight. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the standard Strelitzia reginae, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens and smaller spaces.</p>
