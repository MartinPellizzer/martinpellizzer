                    <h1>Sphedamnocarpus cuspidifolius</h1>
<p>Sphedamnocarpus cuspidifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, narrow, often spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sphedamnocarpus cuspidifolius is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune habitats.</p>
