<p>Stipa vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Stipa vargasii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
