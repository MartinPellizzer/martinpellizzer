                    <h1>Stelis oscitans</h1>
<p>Stelis oscitans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Stelis oscitans is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
