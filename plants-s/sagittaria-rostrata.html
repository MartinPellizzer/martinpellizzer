                    <h1>Sagittaria rostrata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria rostrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands, and has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sagittaria rostrata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
