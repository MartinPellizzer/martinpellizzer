                    <h1>Sphaeromariscus microcephalus</h1>
<p>Sphaeromariscus microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf moon snail, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Naticidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, globular shell that is typically smooth and white or pale in color. The species is found in shallow coastal waters, where it primarily feeds on bivalves such as clams and mussels. Its anatomy includes a well-developed radula for scraping food from its prey.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant.</p>
