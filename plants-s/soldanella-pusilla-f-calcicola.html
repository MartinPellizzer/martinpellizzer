                    <h1>Soldanella pusilla f. calcicola</h1>
<p>Soldanella pusilla f. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sandwort, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white to pale pink flowers. This alpine species is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions with high sunlight exposure. Its compact growth form and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, alkaline conditions make it a unique example of plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem.</p>
