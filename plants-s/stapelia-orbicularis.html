                    <h1>Stapelia orbicularis</h1>
<p>Stapelia orbicularis, commonly known as the football stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, orbicular-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its growth is slow, and it forms a dense rosette structure that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Stapelia orbicularis is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
