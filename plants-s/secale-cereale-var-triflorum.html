                    <h1>Secale cereale var. triflorum</h1>
<p>Secale cereale var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its distinctive floral morphology.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces three florets per spikelet, a trait that sets it apart from the more common two-flowered rye. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in agricultural research due to its genetic variability.</p>
<p>It is also of interest in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
