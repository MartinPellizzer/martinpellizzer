                    <h1>Salicornia × marshallii</h1>
<p>Salicornia × marshallii, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salicornia europaea and Salicornia virginica, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish and are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Salicornia × marshallii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
