<p>Smodingium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Smodingium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
