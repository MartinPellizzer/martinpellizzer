                    <h1>Siphonoglossa calcarea</h1>
<p>Siphonoglossa calcarea, commonly known as the limestone tongue orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with white to pale blue flowers that have a distinct, tongue-like shape. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
