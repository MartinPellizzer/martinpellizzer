                    <h1>Sondottia connata</h1>
<p>Sondottia connata, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline conditions and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs.</p>
<p>Sondottia connata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates.</p>
