                    <h1>Sporobolus littoralis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
<p>Sporobolus littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
