<p>Scrophularia edelbergii subsp.</p>
<p>pseudodeserti, commonly known as the desert scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white.</p>
<p>The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as hairy leaves and a deep root system for water retention. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
