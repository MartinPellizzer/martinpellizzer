<p>Schoenoplectus tatora, commonly known as the Tatora bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it is often found in marshes, lake shores, and riverine habitats. Schoenoplectus tatora plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
