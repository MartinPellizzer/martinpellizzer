                    <h1>Striga glabrata</h1>
<p>Striga glabrata, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and a short, branching stem. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to severely reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Striga glabrata has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants.</p>
