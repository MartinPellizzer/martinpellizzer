<p>Steiractinia ocanensis, commonly known as the Ocanensis orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
