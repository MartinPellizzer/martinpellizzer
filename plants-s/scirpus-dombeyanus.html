<p>Scirpus dombeyanus, commonly known as Dombey's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is important for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus dombeyanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
