                    <h1>Salix depressa var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Salix depressa var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing form, with multiple stems that often spread along the ground. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
