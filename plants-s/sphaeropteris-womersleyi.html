<p>Sphaeropteris womersleyi, commonly known as the Womersley cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and sparsely covered in spines. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
