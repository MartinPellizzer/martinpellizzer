                    <h1>Salvinia minima</h1>
<p>Salvinia minima, commonly known as water mallow, is a small, floating aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that allow it to remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are often mistaken for seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it can disrupt local ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
