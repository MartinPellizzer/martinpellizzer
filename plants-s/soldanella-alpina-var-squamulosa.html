                    <h1>Soldanella alpina var. squamulosa</h1>
<p>Soldanella alpina var. squamulosa, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils and supporting pollinator life.</p>
