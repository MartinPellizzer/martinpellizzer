                    <h1>Stapelia patula var. depressa</h1>
<p>Stapelia patula var. depressa, commonly known as the "Limpopo lantern" or "bottle plant," is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a tendency to form dense clumps when grown in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Stapelia patula var. depressa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
