                    <h1>Solanum rogersii</h1>
<p>Solanum rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, purple to yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species.</p>
<p>Solanum rogersii is often used in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh desert conditions.</p>
