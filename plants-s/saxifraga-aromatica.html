<p>Saxifraga aromatica, commonly known as sweet saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and on cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>
