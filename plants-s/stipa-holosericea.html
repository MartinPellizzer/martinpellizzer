                    <h1>Stipa holosericea</h1>
<p>Stipa holosericea, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
