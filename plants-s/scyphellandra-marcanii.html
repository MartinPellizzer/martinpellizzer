                    <h1>Scyphellandra marcanii</h1>
<p>Scyphellandra marcanii, commonly known as the red-flowered scyphellandra, is a rare and striking member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, typically in humid, shaded environments. The thallus is rich in pigments, giving it a distinctive reddish hue, and it often exhibits a velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, called apothecia, are small and disk-shaped, with bright orange to reddish-brown spore-producing surfaces.</p>
<p>This lichen is of particular interest to mycologists due to its unique chemical composition and limited geographic distribution.</p>
