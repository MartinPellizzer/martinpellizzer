                    <h1>Skizima pumila</h1>
<p>Skizima pumila, commonly known as the dwarf skizima, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible roots. The plant features small, arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Skizima pumila is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with limited sunlight.</p>
