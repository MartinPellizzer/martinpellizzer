                    <h1>Salix fluviatilis var. sericans</h1>
<p>Salix fluviatilis var. sericans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically silvery-white beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, often wet soils along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its distinctive appearance and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
