<p>Salix caprea subsp.</p>
<p>hultenii, commonly known as the Hult√©n's weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
