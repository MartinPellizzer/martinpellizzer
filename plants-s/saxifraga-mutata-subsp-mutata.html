<p>Saxifraga mutata subsp.</p>
<p>mutata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The plant features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
