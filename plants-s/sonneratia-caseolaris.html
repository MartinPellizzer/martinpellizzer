<p>Sonneratia caseolaris, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
