<p>Senecio puna-sessilis, commonly known as the Andean groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler climates.</p>
