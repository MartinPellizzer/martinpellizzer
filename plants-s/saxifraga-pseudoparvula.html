<p>Saxifraga pseudoparvula, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help conserve moisture, and its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters. It is often found in tundra and mountain environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
