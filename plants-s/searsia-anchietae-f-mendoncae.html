<p>Searsia anchietae f. mendoncae, commonly known as the Mendonca firethorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal flowering display.</p>
