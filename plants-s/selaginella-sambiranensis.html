                    <h1>Selaginella sambiranensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambiranensis spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a trait known as heterosporous reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where humidity is high.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
