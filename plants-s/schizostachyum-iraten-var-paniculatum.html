                    <h1>Schizostachyum iraten var. paniculatum</h1>
<p>Schizostachyum iraten var. paniculatum, commonly known as the giant bamboo or wild bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a dense, fibrous structure. The plant produces panicles of small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its hardiness in tropical climates.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its strong, durable culms, which are used in construction and crafts.</p>
