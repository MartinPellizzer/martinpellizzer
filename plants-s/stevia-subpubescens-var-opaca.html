                    <h1>Stevia subpubescens var. opaca</h1>
<p>Stevia subpubescens var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca stevia, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the stevia plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, pale green leaves that are less sweet than those of the more common stevia species. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike.</p>
