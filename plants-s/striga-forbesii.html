                    <h1>Striga forbesii</h1>
<p>Striga forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a slender, branched stem. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the roots of host plants through haustoria.</p>
