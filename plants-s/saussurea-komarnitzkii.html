<p>Saussurea komarnitzkii, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saussurea komarnitzkii is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
