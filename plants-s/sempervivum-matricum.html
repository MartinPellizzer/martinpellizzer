<p>Sempervivum matricum, commonly known as the Mother of Thousands, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its name comes from the numerous tiny plantlets that form along the edges of its leaves, which can be easily detached and grow into new plants.</p>
<p>Sempervivum matricum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
