                    <h1>Sporobolus psammophilus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus psammophilus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus psammophilus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
