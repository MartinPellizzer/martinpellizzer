<p>Scirpus supinus var. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshes and along waterways.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits.</p>
