                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum var. fernandezianum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum var. fernandezianum, commonly known as the Fernandezian potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a fern-like structure that distinguishes it from typical potato varieties. This variant is native to South America, particularly regions of Argentina and Chile, where it grows in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, tuberous roots that are often used in local traditional agriculture.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving potato resilience.</p>
