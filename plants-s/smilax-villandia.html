<p>Smilax villandia, commonly known as the prickly pear or yellow smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Smilax villandia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets.</p>
