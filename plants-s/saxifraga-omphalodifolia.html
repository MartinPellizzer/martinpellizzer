                    <h1>Saxifraga omphalodifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga omphalodifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and gravelly habitats, often found in mountainous areas where the climate is cold and the soil is poor. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Saxifraga omphalodifolia is well adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
