                    <h1>Schizaea confusa</h1>
<p>Schizaea confusa, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a member of the family Huperjiaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its morphology includes a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged.</p>
<p>Schizaea confusa is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
