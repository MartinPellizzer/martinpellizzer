<p>Stelis straminea, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Stelis straminea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
