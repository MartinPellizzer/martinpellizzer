<p>Stapelia × meintjiesii, commonly known as the Meintjiesii Stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Stapelia × meintjiesii is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
