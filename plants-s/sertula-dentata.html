                    <h1>Sertula dentata</h1>
<p>Sertula dentata, commonly known as the toothed sertula, is a species of sea sponge found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dentate (tooth-like) structures on its surface, which contribute to its unique appearance. The sponge's body is composed of a porous skeleton made of silica, known as spicules, which provide structural support. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Sertula dentata plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
