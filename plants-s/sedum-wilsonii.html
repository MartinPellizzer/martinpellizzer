                    <h1>Sedum wilsonii</h1>
<p>Sedum wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for cultivation in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9.</p>
