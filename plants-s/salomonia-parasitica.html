                    <h1>Salomonia parasitica</h1>
<p>Salomonia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants.</p>
<p>Salomonia parasitica is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on various woody plants as a partial parasite.</p>
