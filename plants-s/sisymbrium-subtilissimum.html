                    <h1>Sisymbrium subtilissimum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium subtilissimum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host species.</p>
