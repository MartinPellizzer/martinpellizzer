                    <h1>Stelis espinosae</h1>
<p>Stelis espinosae, commonly known as the Espinoza's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with slender stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool and humid environments. Its botanical features include pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis espinosae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
