<p>Setaria rubicunda, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a reddish tinge, especially at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Setaria rubicunda is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
