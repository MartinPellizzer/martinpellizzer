                    <h1>Scilla praecox</h1>
<p>Scilla praecox, commonly known as early squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring, before many other plants have bloomed. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. It is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Scilla praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit.</p>
