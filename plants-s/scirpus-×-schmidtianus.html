                    <h1>Scirpus × schmidtianus</h1>
<p>Scirpus × schmidtianus, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus tabernaemontani, making it a fascinating example of natural hybridization. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems covered in dense, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life, it is valued in wetland restoration projects.</p>
