<p>Sphaeropteris holttumiana, commonly known as the Holttum's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants.
