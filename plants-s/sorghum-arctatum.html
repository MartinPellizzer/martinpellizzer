                    <h1>Sorghum arctatum</h1>
<p>Sorghum arctatum, commonly known as the woolly sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Sorghum arctatum is often used for forage and has some traditional medicinal uses in indigenous communities.</p>
