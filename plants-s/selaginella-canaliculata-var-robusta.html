                    <h1>Selaginella canaliculata var. robusta</h1>
<p>Selaginella canaliculata var. robusta, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila, or cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
