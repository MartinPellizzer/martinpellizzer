                    <h1>Sedum parvum</h1>
<p>Sedum parvum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum parvum is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil.</p>
