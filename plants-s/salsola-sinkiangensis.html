<p>Salsola sinkiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spine-tipped leaves and pink or purple flowers, which are typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in desert environments.</p>
<p>Salsola sinkiangensis is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
