                    <h1>Shouyangshania</h1>
<p>Shouyangshania, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is native to China and is typically found in subtropical regions with moist, well-drained soil. Shouyangshania produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
