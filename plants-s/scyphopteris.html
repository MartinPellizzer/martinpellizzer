                    <h1>Scyphopteris</h1>
<p>Scyphopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky or shaded substrates. Scyphopteris species are typically found in moist, temperate environments, often in mountainous regions. Their rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing them to spread and establish colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
