                    <h1>Schoenus barbatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus barbatus, commonly known as the bearded sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Schoenus barbatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
