<p>Salvia foveolata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that resemble mist, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its ability to grow in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Salvia foveolata is also a valuable plant for pollinators, attracting bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects.</p>
