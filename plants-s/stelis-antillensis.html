<p>Stelis antillensis, commonly known as the Antillean stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered orchid flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis antillensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
