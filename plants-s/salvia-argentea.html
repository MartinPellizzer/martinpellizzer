<p>Salvia argentea, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Salvia argentea is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
