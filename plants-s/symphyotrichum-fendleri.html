                    <h1>Symphyotrichum fendleri</h1>
<p>Symphyotrichum fendleri, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its blue to purple flower heads bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
