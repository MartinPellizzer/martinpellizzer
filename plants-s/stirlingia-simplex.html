<p>Stirlingia simplex, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Stirlingia simplex plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
