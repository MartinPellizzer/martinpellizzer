                    <h1>Salix otites</h1>
<p>Salix otites, commonly known as the eastern silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a silvery underside, giving the plant its "silky" appearance. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
