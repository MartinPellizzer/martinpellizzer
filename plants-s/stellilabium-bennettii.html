<p>Stellilabium bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's star-labium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and often showy orchid species. The plant is characterized by its unique, star-shaped floral structure, which is both ornamental and ecologically significant. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Stellilabium bennettii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
