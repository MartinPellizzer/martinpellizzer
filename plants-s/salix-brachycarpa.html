                    <h1>Salix brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Salix brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery-gray hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkin-like clusters, which appear early in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Salix brachycarpa is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
