<p>Stipa pseudoichu, commonly known as the false ichu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine or steppe regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in similar climates.</p>
