<p>Sclerocyathium popovii, commonly known as the Popov's rockrose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, rounded, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sclerocyathium popovii is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
