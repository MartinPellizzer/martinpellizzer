                    <h1>Selaginella mnioides var. minor</h1>
<p>Selaginella mnioides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser tropical spikemoss, is a small, low-growing evergreen fern ally native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like colonies on moist, shaded forest floors, often in humid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper stems and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
