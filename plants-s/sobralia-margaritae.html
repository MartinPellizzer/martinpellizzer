                    <h1>Sobralia margaritae</h1>
<p>Sobralia margaritae, commonly known as the Margarita Sobralia, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers that resemble tiny margaritas, hence its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant.</p>
