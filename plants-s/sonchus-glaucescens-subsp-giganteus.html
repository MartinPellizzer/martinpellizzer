<p>Sonchus glaucescens subsp.</p>
<p>giganteus, commonly known as giant sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, silver-green leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It grows up to 1.5 meters tall, making it a striking addition to wildflower gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
