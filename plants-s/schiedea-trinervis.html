<p>Schiedea trinervis, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and a tall, branching stem that produces yellow flowers. The plant thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of Haleakalā National Park. Schiedea trinervis is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
