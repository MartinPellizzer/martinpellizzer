<p>Silene caudata, commonly known as whippletree, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and can reach up to 1 meter in height.</p>
<p>Silene caudata is also known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance from its stems, which has been used traditionally by some Native American tribes.</p>
