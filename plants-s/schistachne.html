                    <h1>Schistachne</h1>
<p>Schistachne, commonly known as false grass or panic grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in wet or disturbed soils. Schistachne species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Many species produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and are sometimes used in horticulture or as indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
