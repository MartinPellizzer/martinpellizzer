                    <h1>Sisymbrium galeottianum var. xerophilum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium galeottianum var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desert mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid ecosystems.</p>
