<p>Sparattanthelium uncigerum, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
