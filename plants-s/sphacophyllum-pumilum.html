                    <h1>Sphacophyllum pumilum</h1>
<p>Sphacophyllum pumilum, commonly known as the small sphacophyllum, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sphaerophyceae and is characterized by its dense, greenish to yellowish thallus. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
