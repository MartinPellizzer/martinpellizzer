<p>Sisymbrium austriacum proles rhedonense, commonly known as the Rhedonense broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in Europe, particularly in Austria and Italy. It has a short life cycle and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
