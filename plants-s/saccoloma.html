                    <h1>Saccoloma</h1>
<p>Saccoloma, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. Saccoloma species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They play an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Saccoloma are still used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
