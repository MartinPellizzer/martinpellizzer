                    <h1>Sambucus ebulus var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Sambucus ebulus var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely lobed, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red,浆果-like berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
