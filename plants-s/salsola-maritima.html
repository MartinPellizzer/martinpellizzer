                    <h1>Salsola maritima</h1>
<p>Salsola maritima, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and saline environments, such as coastal areas and desert regions. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are followed by inflated, three-lobed fruits. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Salsola maritima is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
