                    <h1>Spodiopogon jainii</h1>
<p>Spodiopogon jainii, commonly known as the Jain's spikerush, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the Indian subcontinent, this plant thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and ponds. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are typically arranged in compact inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spodiopogon jainii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
