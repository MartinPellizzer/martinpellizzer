                            <h1>Selaginella Stipulata</h1>
<p>Selaginella stipulata is a unique and ancient plant species belonging to the spore-bearing group known as bryophytes. It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its remarkable adaptability to harsh conditions. This plant is often referred to as a "resurrection plant" due to its ability to survive extreme desiccation and revive when water becomes available. Its distinctive appearance, with small, scale-like leaves and specialized structures, makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study. Despite its humble appearance, Selaginella stipulata plays an important role in its ecosystem and holds scientific value for understanding plant resilience.</p>
