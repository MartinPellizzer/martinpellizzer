<p>Sporobolus hockii, commonly known as Hock's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray tint, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus hockii is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
