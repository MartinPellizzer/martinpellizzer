<p>Selaginella flagelliformis, commonly known as the whiplash spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a specialized ability to retain moisture in its tissues.</p>
<p>Selaginella flagelliformis is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophylls.</p>
