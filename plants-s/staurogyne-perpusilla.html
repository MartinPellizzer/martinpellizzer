                    <h1>Staurogyne perpusilla</h1>
<p>Staurogyne perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, and it produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in nutrient-rich substrates and can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
