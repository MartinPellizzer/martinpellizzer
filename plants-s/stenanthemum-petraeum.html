                    <h1>Stenanthemum petraeum</h1>
<p>Stenanthemum petraeum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its ability to form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows as a low, cushion-like structure, often covering exposed rock surfaces. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and densely packed, reducing water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Stenanthemum petraeum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
