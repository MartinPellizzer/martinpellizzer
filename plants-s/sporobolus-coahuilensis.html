<p>Sporobolus coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Chihuahuan Desert of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, fine-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus coahuilensis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
