<p>Schoenorchis vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverbergh's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its rarity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
