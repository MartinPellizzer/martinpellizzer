                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum paruanum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum paruanum, commonly known as the Philippine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a dense, leafy structure with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients and water from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Sciodaphyllum paruanum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat, supporting local bird populations through its fruit.</p>
