<p>Suaeda baccata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
