                    <h1>Stelis secunda</h1>
<p>Stelis secunda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, elongated stems and produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the dry season. Stelis secunda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
