                    <h1>Schmidelia allophylla</h1>
<p>Schmidelia allophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf schmidelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schmidelia allophylla is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests.</p>
