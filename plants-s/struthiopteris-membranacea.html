                    <h1>Struthiopteris membranacea</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris membranacea, commonly known as the membranous shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The spore-producing sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
