<p>Stapelia crassa, commonly known as the broad-stalked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, waxy, yellowish flowers with a strong scent, often resembling carrion to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Stapelia crassa is a popular choice for cactus and succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
