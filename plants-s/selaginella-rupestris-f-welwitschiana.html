<p>Selaginella rupestris f. welwitschiana, commonly known as the Welwitsch's spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered around the stems, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. It is particularly notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a hardy species adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
