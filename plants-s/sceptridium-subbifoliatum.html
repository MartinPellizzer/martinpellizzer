<p>Sceptridium subbifoliatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Sceptridium subbifoliatum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
