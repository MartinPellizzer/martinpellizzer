                    <h1>Stenostephanus longistaminus var. angustissimus</h1>
<p>Stenostephanus longistaminus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed stephanus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
