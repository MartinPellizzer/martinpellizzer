<p>Salsola pseudotragus, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are extensive, allowing it to anchor in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Salsola pseudotragus is often found in disturbed areas and can play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
