<p>Schlumbergera obtusangula, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a hybrid species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear bright, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its blooming period typically occurs during the holiday season, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, and the plant requires well-draining soil and moderate watering to flourish.</p>
