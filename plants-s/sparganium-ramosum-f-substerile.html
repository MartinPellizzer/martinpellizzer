                    <h1>Sparganium ramosum f. substerile</h1>
<p>Sparganium ramosum f. substerile, commonly known as the sterile fragrant burr, is a botanical variant of the common burr plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced fertility, resulting in the absence of viable seeds. The plant retains the typical morphology of Sparganium ramosum, featuring dense, spiky inflorescences and aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habits. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its sterile nature makes it useful for ornamental purposes or in controlled ecological studies.</p>
