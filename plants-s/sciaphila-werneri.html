                    <h1>Sciaphila werneri</h1>
<p>Sciaphila werneri, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a single, elongated leaf that supports its delicate inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Sciaphila werneri is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
