                    <h1>Selenocarpaea pinnata</h1>
<p>Selenocarpaea pinnata, commonly known as the silverleaf selenocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Selenocarpaea pinnata is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
