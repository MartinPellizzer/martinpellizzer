<p>Sergilus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Sergilus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
