<p>Seriphidium maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue to purple flower heads, which appear in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found along cliffs and dunes. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Seriphidium maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
