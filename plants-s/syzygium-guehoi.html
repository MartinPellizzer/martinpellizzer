                    <h1>Syzygium guehoi</h1>
<p>Syzygium guehoi, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. Syzygium guehoi is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and perfumery.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
