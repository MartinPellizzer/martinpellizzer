                    <h1>Scirpus ambiguus</h1>
<p>Scirpus ambiguus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread and colonize wet soils effectively.</p>
<p>Scirpus ambiguus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and wetland organisms.</p>
