<p>Stenocereus gummosus, commonly known as the gummosis cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, waxy skin helps it retain water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Stenocereus gummosus is also known for secreting a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name.</p>
