                    <h1>Sagittaria pugioniformis var. chilensis</h1>
<p>Sagittaria pugioniformis var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common sight in wetlands and ponds.</p>
