<p>Stonesiella, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, often thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments.

Stonesiella species are native to regions with rocky or dry soils, such as parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
