                    <h1>Salvia sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Salvia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparsely flowered sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
