                    <h1>Sievekingia herklotziana</h1>
<p>Sievekingia herklotziana, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is relatively rare in cultivation, requiring specific care to thrive.</p>
