                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. columbiana</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila at the base of the leaves, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
