                    <h1>Sesuvium ortegae</h1>
<p>Sesuvium ortegae, commonly known as the coastal sesuvium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fleshy, lobed leaves are covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, which help it survive in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Sesuvium ortegae is often found growing in dune systems and is valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
