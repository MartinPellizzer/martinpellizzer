                    <h1>Sidasodes</h1>
<p>Sidasodes, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in coastal and mountainous environments. Sidasodes species are characterized by their compact growth habit, evergreen foliage, and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They typically prefer well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely commercially grown.</p>
