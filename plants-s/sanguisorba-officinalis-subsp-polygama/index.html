<p>Red stem sorrel, scientifically known as Sanguisorba officinalis subsp. polygama, is a striking perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant green in spring. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, form dense clusters of pink to red blooms. Despite its ornamental appeal, it also holds historical significance in traditional medicine and herbal practices.</p>
