<p>Solenopsis canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands antplant, is a unique species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food while absorbing nutrients from their colony. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit with small, needle-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
