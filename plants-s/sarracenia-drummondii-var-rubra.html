<p>Sarracenia drummondii var. rubra, commonly known as the red-tipped pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-tinged pitchers, which are modified leaves designed to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its pitchers are often adorned with fine hairs and nectar-secreting glands to lure prey.</p>
<p>This variant is prized by horticulturists for its vibrant coloration and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
