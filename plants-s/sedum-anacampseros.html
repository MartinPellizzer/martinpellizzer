                    <h1>Sedum anacampseros</h1>
<p>Sedum anacampseros, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It grows in a low, spreading habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
