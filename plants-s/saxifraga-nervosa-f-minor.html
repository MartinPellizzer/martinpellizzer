                    <h1>Saxifraga nervosa f. minor</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nervosa f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
