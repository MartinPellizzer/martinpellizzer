<p>Solidago ulmifolia, commonly known as green goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowering period makes it an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Solidago ulmifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
