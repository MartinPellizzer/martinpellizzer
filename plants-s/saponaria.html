                    <h1>Saponaria</h1>
<p>Saponaria, commonly known as soapwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Saponaria species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky soils across temperate regions. The plant is named for the soapy lather produced when its leaves are crushed, due to the presence of saponins.</p>
<p>Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine and as natural detergents.</p>
