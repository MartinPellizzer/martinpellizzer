                    <h1>Stenaria umbratilis var. brevipedicellata</h1>
<p>Stenaria umbratilis var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed shadow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided, dark green fronds that thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant's unique morphology includes short, sturdy pedicels that support its small, ovate spore-bearing structures. It prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
