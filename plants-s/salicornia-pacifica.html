                    <h1>Salicornia pacifica</h1>
<p>Salicornia pacifica, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub with jointed, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in coastal and arid regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its leaves are usually reduced to scales, and the stems are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salicornia pacifica is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
