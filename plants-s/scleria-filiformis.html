<p>Scleria filiformis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Scleria filiformis often grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environments.</p>
