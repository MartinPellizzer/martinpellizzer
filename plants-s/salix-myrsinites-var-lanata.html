<p>Salix myrsinites var. lanata, commonly known as woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silky white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
