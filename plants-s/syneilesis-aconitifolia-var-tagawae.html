                    <h1>Syneilesis aconitifolia var. tagawae</h1>
<p>Syneilesis aconitifolia var. tagawae, commonly known as the Tagawa's alderleaf, is a rare variant of the alderleaf plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that resemble those of alder trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
