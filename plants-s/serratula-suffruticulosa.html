                    <h1>Serratula suffruticulosa</h1>
<p>Serratula suffruticulosa, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by spiny, bracts that protect the seed heads. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Serratula suffruticulosa is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
