<p>Saxifraga ludlowii, commonly known as Ludlow's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saxifraga ludlowii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
