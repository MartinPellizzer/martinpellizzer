                    <h1>Selaginella calcicola</h1>
<p>Selaginella calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or limestone substrates. Its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed or barren environments.</p>
<p>Selaginella calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
