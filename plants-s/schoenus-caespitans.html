                    <h1>Schoenus caespitans</h1>
<p>Schoenus caespitans, commonly known as the tufted bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems that often have a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Schoenus caespitans is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
