<p>Sipanea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, black, berry-like fruits. Sipanea brasiliensis is valued for its fragrant timber, which is used in the production of incense and perfumes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
