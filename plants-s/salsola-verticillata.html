                    <h1>Salsola verticillata</h1>
<p>Salsola verticillata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual shrub native to Eurasia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Salsola verticillata is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common species in deserts and semi-arid regions.</p>
