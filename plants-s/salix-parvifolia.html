<p>Salix parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long and have a smooth, often slightly hairy surface.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies.</p>
<p>Salix parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
