                    <h1>Scleria bracteata var. floribunda</h1>
<p>Scleria bracteata var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
