                    <h1>Sabulina umbellulifera var. kurdica</h1>
<p>Sabulina umbellulifera var. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features a compact rosette of hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in a loose umbel. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil nutrients.</p>
<p>This variant is considered a botanical curiosity due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
