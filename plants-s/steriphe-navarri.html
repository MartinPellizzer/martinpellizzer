                    <h1>Steriphe navarri</h1>
<p>Steriphe navarri, commonly known as the Navarre sponge spore plant, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterigmatellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, sponge-like thallus structure. The plant's reproductive structures, known as soredia, are dispersed through the air, allowing it to colonize new areas. Steriphe navarri is often found on bark and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides insights into lichen adaptation and ecological resilience.</p>
