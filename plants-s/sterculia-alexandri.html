<p>Sterculia alexandri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture and construction.</p>
