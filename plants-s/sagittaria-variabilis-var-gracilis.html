The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and shallow water environments, often forming dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a range of water conditions make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
