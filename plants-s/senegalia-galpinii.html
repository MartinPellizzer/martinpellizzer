<p>Senegalia galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its distinctive, feathery foliage composed of small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which splits open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Senegalia galpinii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in drought-prone regions.</p>
