<p>Stapelia courcellii, commonly known as the "Coral Stapelia," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often orange or red in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia courcellii is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
