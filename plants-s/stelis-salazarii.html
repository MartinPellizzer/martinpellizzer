                    <h1>Stelis salazarii</h1>
<p>Stelis salazarii, commonly known as the Salazar's spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thin pseudobulbs and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Stelis salazarii is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
