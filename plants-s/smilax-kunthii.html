                    <h1>Smilax kunthii</h1>
<p>Smilax kunthii, commonly known as the Mexican catbriar, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Smilax kunthii is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its robust growth and persistent foliage make it a notable component of the undergrowth in its native habitats.</p>
