                    <h1>Salix hylonoma var. hylonoma</h1>
<p>Salix hylonoma var. hylonoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations where it forms dense thickets. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
