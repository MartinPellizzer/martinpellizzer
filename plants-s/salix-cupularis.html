                    <h1>Salix cupularis</h1>
<p>Salix cupularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>
