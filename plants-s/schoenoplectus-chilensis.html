<p>Schoenoplectus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense, cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus chilensis is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife habitats.</p>
