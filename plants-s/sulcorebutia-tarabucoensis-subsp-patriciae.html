<p>Sulcorebutia tarabucoensis subsp.</p>
<p>patriciae, commonly known as the Patricia's Sulcorebutia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
