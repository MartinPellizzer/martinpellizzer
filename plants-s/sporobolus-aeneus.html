<p>Sporobolus aeneus, commonly known as silverleaf grama, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>Silverleaf grama is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits.</p>
