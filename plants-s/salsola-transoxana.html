<p>Salsola transoxana, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or alkaline soils, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has a prostrate or erect growth habit, with small, spiny leaves and pink or purple flowers. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
<p>Salsola transoxana is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
