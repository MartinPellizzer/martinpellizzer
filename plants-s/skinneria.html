                    <h1>Skinneria</h1>
<p>Skinneria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its striking, white, spider-like flowers. Skinneria is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Skinneria is considered a conservation concern.</p>
