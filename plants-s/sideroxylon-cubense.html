<p>Sideroxylon cubense, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in cup-like structures, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Sideroxylon cubense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
