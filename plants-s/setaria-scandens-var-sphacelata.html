                    <h1>Setaria scandens var. sphacelata</h1>
<p>Setaria scandens var. sphacelata, commonly known as silvergrass or curly bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery sheen on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, feathery appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
