                    <h1>Salix bifurcata</h1>
<p>Salix bifurcata, commonly known as the two-branched willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streams.</p>
<p>Salix bifurcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streambanks.</p>
