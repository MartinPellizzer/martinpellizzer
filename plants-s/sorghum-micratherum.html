                    <h1>Sorghum micratherum</h1>
<p>Sorghum micratherum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small-statured grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny grains, which are typically used for animal feed. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is often cultivated in dryland conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is an important forage crop in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
