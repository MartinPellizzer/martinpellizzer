                    <h1>Sesuvium portulacastrum f. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Sesuvium portulacastrum f. albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower sea purslane, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white floral color, setting it apart from the more common red-flowered form of the species.</p>
