                    <h1>Scorzoneroides autumnalis var. salina</h1>
<p>Scorzoneroides autumnalis var. salina, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or brackish habitat.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
