                    <h1>Spartina michauxiana var. suttiei</h1>
<p>Spartina michauxiana var. suttiei, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is typically found in coastal salt marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system helps filter sediments and support diverse aquatic life in estuarine ecosystems.</p>
