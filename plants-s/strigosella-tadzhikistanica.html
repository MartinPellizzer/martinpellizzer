                    <h1>Strigosella tadzhikistanica</h1>
<p>Strigosella tadzhikistanica, commonly known as the Tajikistan lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth and tightly adherent texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on limestone or granite substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
