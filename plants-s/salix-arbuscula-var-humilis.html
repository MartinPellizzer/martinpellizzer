                    <h1>Salix arbuscula var. humilis</h1>
<p>Salix arbuscula var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals.</p>
