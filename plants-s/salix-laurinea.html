                    <h1>Salix laurinea</h1>
<p>Salix laurinea, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red-brown female flowers that develop into woody capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Salix laurinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
