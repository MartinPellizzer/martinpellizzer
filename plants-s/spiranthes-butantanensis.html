                    <h1>Spiranthes butantanensis</h1>
<p>Spiranthes butantanensis, commonly known as the Butantan Spiral Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and they bloom during the late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiranthes butantanensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
