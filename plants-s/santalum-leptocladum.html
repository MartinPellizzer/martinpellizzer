                    <h1>Santalum leptocladum</h1>
<p>Santalum leptocladum, commonly known as the slender-branch sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots called haustoria. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fragrant wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>The species is also important for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
