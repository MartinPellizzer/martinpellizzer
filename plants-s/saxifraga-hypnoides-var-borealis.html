                    <h1>Saxifraga hypnoides var. borealis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hypnoides var. borealis, commonly known as Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments, often found on rocky slopes and tundra, where it adapts to cold temperatures and limited soil. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience and is an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
