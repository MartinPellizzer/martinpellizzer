<p>Syngonanthus multicaulis var. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it its characteristic glaucous appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a basal rosette, and are adapted to thrive in saturated soil conditions.</p>
