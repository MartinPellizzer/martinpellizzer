<p>Selaginella longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of resurrection plant behavior, capable of surviving extreme desiccation and reviving upon rehydration. The plant has a creeping, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are borne on specialized stalks, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
