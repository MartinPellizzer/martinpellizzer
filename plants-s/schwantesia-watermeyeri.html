<p>Schwantesia watermeyeri, commonly known as the watermeyeri cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
