                    <h1>Sarracenia minor</h1>
<p>Sarracenia minor, commonly known as the lesser purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically purple or reddish in color, with a narrow throat that aids in trapping insects. Sarracenia minor thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and sunlight.</p>
<p>It is often found in bogs and swampy areas, where it plays a unique ecological role in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
