                    <h1>Sciaphila consimilis</h1>
<p>Sciaphila consimilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciaphila consimilis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
