                    <h1>Selenipedium × hardyanum var. penalus</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × hardyanum var. penalus, commonly known as the Peninsular selenipedium, is a rare and endangered hybrid orchid native to the humid lowland forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It has long, strap-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 2 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
