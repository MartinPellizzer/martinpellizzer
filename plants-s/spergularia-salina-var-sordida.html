                    <h1>Spergularia salina var. sordida</h1>
<p>Spergularia salina var. sordida, commonly known as salt marsh sandplant, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuarine habitats where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces tiny, pinkish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the genus Spergularia, which are known for their ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
