                            <h1>Santolina Chamaecyparissus Subsp. Squarrosa</h1>
<p>Santolina chamaecyparissus subsp. squarrosa is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. This subspecies is distinguished by its compact, silver-green foliage and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It is often mistaken for its more common relatives due to its similar appearance but holds unique ecological significance. Native to the Mediterranean region, it has gained popularity among gardeners for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Its resilience and beauty make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping and coastal landscaping.</p>
