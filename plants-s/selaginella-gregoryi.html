<p>It is a small, evergreen, spore-bearing plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores, which are essential for its propagation.</p>
<p>Selaginella gregoryi is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
