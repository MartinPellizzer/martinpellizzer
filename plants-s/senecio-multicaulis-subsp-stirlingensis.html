<p>Senecio multicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>stirlingensis, commonly known as Stirling's iceplant, is a succulent perennial native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
