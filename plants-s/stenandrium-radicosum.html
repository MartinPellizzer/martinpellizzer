                    <h1>Stenandrium radicosum</h1>
<p>Stenandrium radicosum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Stenandrium radicosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments.</p>
