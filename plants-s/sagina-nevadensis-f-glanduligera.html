<p>Sagina nevadensis f. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its glandular surfaces and hairy stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
