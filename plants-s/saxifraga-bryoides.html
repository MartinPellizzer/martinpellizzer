                    <h1>Saxifraga bryoides</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bryoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates, thriving in cold, moist environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves during the short growing season.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bryoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats.</p>
