<p>Sorbus aria var. hazslinszkyana, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a rare and botanically distinct variant of the common whitebeam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow berries and its distinctive, often twisted, branching pattern. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with serrated edges and can vary in color from dark green to reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
