                    <h1>Stapelia barbata</h1>
<p>Stapelia barbata, commonly known as the hairy stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a unique ability to form offsets, which help in propagation.</p>
<p>Stapelia barbata is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
