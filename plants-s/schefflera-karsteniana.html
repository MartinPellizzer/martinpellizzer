<p>Schefflera karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Schefflera karsteniana is also valued for its ability to tolerate indoor conditions and its role in ornamental horticulture.</p>
