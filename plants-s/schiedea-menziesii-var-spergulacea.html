<p>Schiedea menziesii var. spergulacea, commonly known as the Hawaiian skyrocket, is a rare endemic species found primarily on the island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to ecological changes and invasive species.</p>
