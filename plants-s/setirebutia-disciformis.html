<p>Setirebutia disciformis, commonly known as the disc-shaped setirebutia, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique disc-like inflorescence, which is a modified stem that bears both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species.</p>
