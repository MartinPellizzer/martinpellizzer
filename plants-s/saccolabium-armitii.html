<p>Saccolabium armitii, commonly known as the woolly burr.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous, burr-like structure. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought.</p>
