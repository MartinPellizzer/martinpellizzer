                    <h1>Schizaea</h1>
<p>Schizaea, commonly known as the club moss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the order Microspermales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to form dense, low-growing mats or cushions. Schizaea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play a significant role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some Schizaea species are still cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance.</p>
