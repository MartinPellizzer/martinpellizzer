<p>Sphaeropus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf glasswort, is a small succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces tiny, pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
