                    <h1>Stubendorffia</h1>
<p>Stubendorffia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to South Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. Stubendorffia species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their preference for well-draining soil. They produce flowers throughout the year under proper care, making them a favorite among indoor gardeners.</p>
<p>The genus is closely related to the Saintpaulia genus, which includes the commonly cultivated African violets.</p>
