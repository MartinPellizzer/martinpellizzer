                    <h1>Salix pseudocordata var. aequalis</h1>
<p>Salix pseudocordata var. aequalis, commonly known as the equal-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold and harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
