                    <h1>Styphelia blepharophylla</h1>
<p>Styphelia blepharophylla, commonly known as the pink fairywand, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid and acidic habitats. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in pine forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
