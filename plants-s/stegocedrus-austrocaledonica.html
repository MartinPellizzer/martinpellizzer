<p>Stegocedrus austrocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and a distinctive, slow-growing trunk that often develops a buttressed base. The plant belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is notable for its unique ecological role in the region's rainforests. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
