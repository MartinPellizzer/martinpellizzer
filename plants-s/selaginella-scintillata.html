                    <h1>Selaginella scintillata</h1>
<p>Selaginella scintillata, commonly known as the glittering spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microspores and megaspores, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low moisture.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies of desert and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
