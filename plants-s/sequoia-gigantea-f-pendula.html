                    <h1>Sequoia gigantea f. pendula</h1>
<p>Sequoia gigantea f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping giant sequoia, is a unique variant of the giant sequoia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the typical upright giant sequoia, resulting in a more delicate and ornamental structure. The leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, typical of the Sequoia genus.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, though it is less hardy than its upright counterpart.</p>
