                    <h1>Syngonanthus nanus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various species of oak trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, white berries that are consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds to other host trees. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots that are embedded in the host tree's bark. It is native to parts of the southeastern United States and is often found in humid, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time if left unchecked.</p>
