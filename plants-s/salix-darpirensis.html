<p>Salix darpirensis, commonly known as the Darpire Willow, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its growth habit is shrub-like, often forming dense thickets in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix darpirensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
