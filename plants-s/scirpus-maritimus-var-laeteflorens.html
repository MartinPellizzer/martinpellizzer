                    <h1>Scirpus maritimus var. laeteflorens</h1>
<p>Scirpus maritimus var. laeteflorens, commonly known as the cheerful bulrush, is a wetland plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in brackish or saline water, often found in marshes and tidal zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its more vibrant and showy inflorescences compared to the typical Scirpus maritimus.</p>
