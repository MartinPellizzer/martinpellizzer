                    <h1>Sagina japonica</h1>
<p>Sagina japonica, commonly known as Japanese pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Sagina japonica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
