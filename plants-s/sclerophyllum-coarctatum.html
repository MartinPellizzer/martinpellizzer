                    <h1>Sclerophyllum coarctatum</h1>
<p>Sclerophyllum coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are thick, leathery, and typically narrow, a feature typical of sclerophyllous plants adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean-type climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Sclerophyllum coarctatum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>
