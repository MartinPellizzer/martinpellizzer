                    <h1>Sphingium viscidulum</h1>
<p>Sphingium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are covered in tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms. The plant is part of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its unique method of obtaining nutrients through passive predation. Its sticky secretions help in capturing prey, which it then digests.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it can thrive in the presence of sunlight.</p>
