<p>Sisymbrium junceum subsp.</p>
<p>intermedium, commonly known as intermediate broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and chloroplasts, making it a parasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>This species typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, often in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as siliques.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
