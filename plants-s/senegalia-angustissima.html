                    <h1>Senegalia angustissima</h1>
<p>Senegalia angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Senegalia angustissima is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
