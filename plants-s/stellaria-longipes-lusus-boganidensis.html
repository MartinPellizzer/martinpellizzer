<p>Stellaria longipes lusus boganidensis, commonly known as the Boganidens starwort, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
