                    <h1>Schizomeria brassii</h1>
<p>Schizomeria brassii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Schizomeria brassii is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme conditions with limited water availability.</p>
