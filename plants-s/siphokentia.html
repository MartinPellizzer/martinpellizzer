                    <h1>Siphokentia</h1>
<p>Siphokentia, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their thick, swollen trunks that store water, making them well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically palmate, with multiple lobes, and the flowers are often showy, ranging in color from yellow to red. Siphokentia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have also been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians.</p>
