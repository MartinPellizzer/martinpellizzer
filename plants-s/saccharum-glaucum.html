                    <h1>Saccharum glaucum</h1>
<p>Saccharum glaucum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in wetland areas and can thrive in moist, acidic soils. It produces tall, slender inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>While not as economically significant as sugarcane, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses.</p>
