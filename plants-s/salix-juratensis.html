                    <h1>Salix juratensis</h1>
<p>Salix juratensis, commonly known as Juratensian willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. Its flowers are catkin-like, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix juratensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
