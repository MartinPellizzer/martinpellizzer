<p>Sempervivum hirtum var. amblysepalum, commonly known as the Wooly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly white coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rock crevices and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to form compact, rosette-shaped clusters.</p>
