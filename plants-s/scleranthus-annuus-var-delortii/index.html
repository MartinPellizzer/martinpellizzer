<p>Common evening-primrose, scientifically known as Scleranthus annuus var. delortii, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the evening. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
