                    <h1>Selaginella cumingiana var. simpliciramosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella cumingiana var. simpliciramosa, commonly known as the simple-ramose spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its stems.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique sporophyte structure with strobila that bear microsporangia and megasporangia for reproduction. Its morphology resembles other spikemosses, with a creeping or upright growth habit depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting diverse microfauna in its native habitats.</p>
