                    <h1>Salix glaucoides</h1>
<p>Salix glaucoides, commonly known as the white willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its common name, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
