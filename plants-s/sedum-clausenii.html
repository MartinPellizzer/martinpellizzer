                <h1>Sedum clausenii</h1>
<p>Sedum clausenii, commonly known as the Clausen's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum clausenii is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
