                    <h1>Saussurea sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Saussurea sessiliflora, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms low, compact clumps. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils, while its hairy leaves reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Saussurea sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
