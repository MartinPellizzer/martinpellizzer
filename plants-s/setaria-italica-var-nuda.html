                    <h1>Setaria italica var. nuda</h1>
<p>Setaria italica var. nuda, commonly known as naked barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found along roadsides or in disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and lack the hull found in other barley varieties, making them easy to process.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but has potential as a minor grain crop in certain agricultural systems.</p>
