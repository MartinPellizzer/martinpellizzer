                    <h1>Schoenoplectiella × naritaensis</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectiella × naritaensis, commonly known as the hybrid reed, is a wetland plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Schoenoplectiella japonica and Schoenoplectiella formosana. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands in marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and sterility, it is considered rare and of conservation interest.</p>
