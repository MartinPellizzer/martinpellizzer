<p>Salix pychnocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures.</p>
<p>Salix pychnocarpa is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
