<p>Sporobolus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitats.</p>
