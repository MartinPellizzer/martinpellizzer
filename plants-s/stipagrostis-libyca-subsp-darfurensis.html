<p>Stipagrostis libyca subsp.</p>
<p>darfurensis, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert margins and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
