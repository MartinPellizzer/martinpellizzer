<p>Senecio greenmanianus var. subdevestita, commonly known as the nakedleaf senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, often hairy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The leaves are typically reduced or absent, giving the plant its distinctive "naked" appearance. It produces yellowish to orange flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
