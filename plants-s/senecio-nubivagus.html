<p>Senecio nubivagus, commonly known as the cloud's edge or alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
