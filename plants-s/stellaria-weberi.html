                    <h1>Stellaria weberi</h1>
<p>Stellaria weberi, commonly known as the Weber's starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Stellaria weberi plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
