                    <h1>Sedum alboroseum</h1>
<p>Sedum alboroseum, commonly known as the "White Rose Sedum," is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that form a low-growing rosette, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and delicate blooms.</p>
