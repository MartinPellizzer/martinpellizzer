                    <h1>Salix laggeri</h1>
<p>Salix laggeri, commonly known as the Lagger's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wet meadows. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a rough texture and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Salix laggeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion.</p>
