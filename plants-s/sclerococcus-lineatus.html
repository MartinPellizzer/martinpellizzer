                    <h1>Sclerococcus lineatus</h1>
<p>Sclerococcus lineatus, commonly known as the lineated scalebug, is a small, armored scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body covered in a waxy, shield-like covering. The plant it infests is typically a woody shrub or tree, where it feeds on sap from the phloem tissue. Its presence can lead to yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and in severe cases, plant death.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic appearance, it is often difficult to detect without close inspection.</p>
