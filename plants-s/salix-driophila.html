                    <h1>Salix driophila</h1>
<p>Salix driophila, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing form, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the growing season to take advantage of short summer periods. Salix driophila is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
