                    <h1>Salvia flaccidifolia</h1>
<p>Salvia flaccidifolia, commonly known as the flaccidleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes and gardens.</p>
