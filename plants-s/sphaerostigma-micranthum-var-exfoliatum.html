                    <h1>Sphaerostigma micranthum var. exfoliatum</h1>
<p>Sphaerostigma micranthum var. exfoliatum, commonly known as the peeling sphaerostigma, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and exhibit a distinctive peeling or flaking texture, which aids in reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
