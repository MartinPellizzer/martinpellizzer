<p>Schizaea malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its wiry, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves.
