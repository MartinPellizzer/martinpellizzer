                    <h1>Selliguea subebenipes</h1>
<p>Selliguea subebenipes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true leaves and stems, and instead has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus. Selliguea subebenipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and are involved in sexual reproduction.</p>
