<p>Saxifraga globulifera var. trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's globular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Saxifragaceae family.</p>
