                    <h1>Sarcanthus ophioglossa</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus ophioglossa, commonly known as the lesser sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
