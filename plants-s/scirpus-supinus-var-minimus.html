<p>Scirpus supinus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale brown spikelets that are clustered at the tips of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
