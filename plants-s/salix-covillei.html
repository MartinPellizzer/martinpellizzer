<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, clustered female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream valleys and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Coville willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
