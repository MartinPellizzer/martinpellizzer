                    <h1>Stilbe mucronata var. cuspidata</h1>
<p>Stilbe mucronata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips and is valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
