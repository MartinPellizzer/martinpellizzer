                    <h1>Schismatoclada</h1>
<p>Schismatoclada, commonly known as the desert star or false aloe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with succulent, often hairy leaves that store water, aiding in their survival in dry conditions. They produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Schismatoclada species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens that require minimal water.</p>
