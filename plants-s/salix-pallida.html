<p>Salix pallida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is thin and gray, often peeling in strips, and it is well adapted to wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>Salix pallida is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows, where it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
