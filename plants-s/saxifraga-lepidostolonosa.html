                    <h1>Saxifraga lepidostolonosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lepidostolonosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize rocky or barren soils.</p>
<p>Saxifraga lepidostolonosa is well adapted to nutrient-poor, wind-exposed habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
