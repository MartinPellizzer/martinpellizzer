<p>Saxifraga hypericoides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh climates and has a creeping growth habit that allows it to spread across rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions.</p>
