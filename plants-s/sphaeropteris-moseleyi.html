                    <h1>Sphaeropteris moseleyi</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris moseleyi, commonly known as the Moseley's cycad, is a unique member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
