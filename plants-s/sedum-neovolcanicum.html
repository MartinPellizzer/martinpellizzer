                    <h1>Sedum neovolcanicum</h1>
<p>Sedum neovolcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic sedum, is a succulent plant native to volcanic regions in Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats on rocky or volcanic soils.</p>
<p>Sedum neovolcanicum is well adapted to high sunlight exposure and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
