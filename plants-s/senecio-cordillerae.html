<p>Senecio cordillerae, commonly known as the Cordillera Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Senecio cordillerae is relatively rare and often found in alpine regions.</p>
