                    <h1>Spiraea arenaria</h1>
<p>Spiraea arenaria, commonly known as sand spire, is a low-growing shrub native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, arching stems that are often covered with a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense coating of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Spiraea arenaria is well adapted to harsh, windy environments and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
