<p>trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's globular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.

<p>The plant blooms with clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in a globular or spherical shape, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
