<p>Stemonacanthus thyrsacanthoides, commonly known as the desert candle.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in desert conditions.</p>
