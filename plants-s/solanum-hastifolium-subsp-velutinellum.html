<p>Solanum hastifolium subsp.</p>
<p>velutinellum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves that are typically heart-shaped or hastate.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
