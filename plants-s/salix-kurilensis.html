<p>Salix kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Salix kurilensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
