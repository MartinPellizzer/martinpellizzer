                    <h1>Stipagrostis arabiifelicis</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis arabiifelicis, commonly known as the Arabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soils with low water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
