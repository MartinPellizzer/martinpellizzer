                    <h1>Sarcococca pruniformis var. dioica</h1>
<p>Sarcococca pruniformis var. dioica, commonly known as the dioecious sarcococca, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy foliage and small, fragrant flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, which is a notable botanical feature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its dense, attractive foliage.</p>
<p>The berries that follow the flowers are dark blue and persist through winter, adding seasonal interest to the plant.</p>
