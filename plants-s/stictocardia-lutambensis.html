                    <h1>Stictocardia lutambensis</h1>
<p>Stictocardia lutambensis, commonly known as the Lutamb√© lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It is often found growing on bark, stones, or soil in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
