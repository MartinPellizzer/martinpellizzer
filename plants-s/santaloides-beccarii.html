<p>Santaloides beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
