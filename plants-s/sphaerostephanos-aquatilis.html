                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos aquatilis</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos aquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic star-stephanos, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its unique, spherical inflorescence.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and clustered, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
