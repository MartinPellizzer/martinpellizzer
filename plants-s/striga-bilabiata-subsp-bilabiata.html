<p>Striga bilabiata subsp.</p>
<p>bilabiata, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting cereal crops like maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it poses a major challenge to food security in affected regions.</p>
