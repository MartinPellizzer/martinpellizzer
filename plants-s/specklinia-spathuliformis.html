<p>Specklinia spathuliformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Specklinia spathuliformis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
