<p>Specklinia hystrix, commonly known as the hystrix orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique hystrix-like bracts, which are stiff and pointed, give it its common name.</p>
<p>Specklinia hystrix is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
