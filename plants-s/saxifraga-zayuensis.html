<p>Saxifraga zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Tsangpo saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features compact, rosette-like foliage with dark green, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
