                    <h1>Sphedamnocarpus rogersii</h1>
<p>Sphedamnocarpus rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered on specialized leaves called sporophylls. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology includes a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
