<p>Styrax laevis, commonly known as the smooth styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually light green and slightly hairy beneath. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic resin.</p>
