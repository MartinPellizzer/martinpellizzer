                    <h1>Scleria reticularis var. pumila</h1>
<p>Scleria reticularis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf netleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, triangular stems with a distinctive reticulate pattern on its surface, giving it a unique appearance. Its small, grass-like leaves are usually green, and it produces spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact size and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
