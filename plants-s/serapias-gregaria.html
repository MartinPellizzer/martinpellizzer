                    <h1>Serapias gregaria</h1>
<p>Serapias gregaria, commonly known as the Alpine marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Serapias gregaria is known for its ability to form dense clusters, hence its specific epithet "gregaria," meaning "gregarious" or living in groups.</p>
