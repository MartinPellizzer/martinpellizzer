<p>Saussurea lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
