<p>Stipa jacquemontii, commonly known as the golden needle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
