                    <h1>Salix angustifolia</h1>
<p>Salix angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or yellowish on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
