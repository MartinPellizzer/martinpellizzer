<p>Senegalia tomentella, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage and slender, often thorny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in tough pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Senegalia tomentella is well-suited to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
