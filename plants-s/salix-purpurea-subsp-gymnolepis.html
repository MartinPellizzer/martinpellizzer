<p>Salix purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>gymnolepis, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in wetland habitats.</p>
