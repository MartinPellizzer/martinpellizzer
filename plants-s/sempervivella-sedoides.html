<p>Sempervivella sedoides, commonly known as the stonecrop sedoides, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered rare and requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival.</p>
