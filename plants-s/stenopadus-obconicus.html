<p>Stenopadus obconicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
