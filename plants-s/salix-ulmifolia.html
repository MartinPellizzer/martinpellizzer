<p>Salix ulmifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive near water sources.</p>
