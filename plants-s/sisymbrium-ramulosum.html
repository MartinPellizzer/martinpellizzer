                    <h1>Sisymbrium ramulosum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium ramulosum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and a branched, leafless stem that often grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially parasitizes the roots of other plants to obtain nutrients.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium ramulosum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats.</p>
