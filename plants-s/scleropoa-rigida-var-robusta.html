                    <h1>Scleropoa rigida var. robusta</h1>
<p>Scleropoa rigida var. robusta, commonly known as the robust rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Scleropoa rigida var. robusta is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
