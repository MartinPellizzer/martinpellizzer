                    <h1>Streptopus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Streptopus paniculatus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts that give it a unique appearance. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid and salty environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Streptopus paniculatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal conditions.</p>
