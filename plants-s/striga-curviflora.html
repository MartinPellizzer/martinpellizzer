                    <h1>Striga curviflora</h1>
<p>Striga curviflora, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and cereal crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, annual life cycle. It is native to Africa and is considered a major weed in agricultural systems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields and is a challenge for farmers in sub-Saharan regions.</p>
