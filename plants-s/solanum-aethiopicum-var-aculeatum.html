<p>Solanum aethiopicum var. aculeatum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into green, fleshy berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, so caution is necessary.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
