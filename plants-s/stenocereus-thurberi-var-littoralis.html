                    <h1>Stenocereus thurberi var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Stenocereus thurberi var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal organ pipe cactus, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white spines and have a ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the standard Stenocereus thurberi and is often found in areas with limited rainfall and high salt exposure.</p>
