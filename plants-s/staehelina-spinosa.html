                    <h1>Staehelina spinosa</h1>
<p>Staehelina spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Staehelina spinosa is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and unique member of the cactus family.</p>
