<p>Saxifraga cespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>subgemmifera, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through vegetative growth via gemmae makes it well adapted to harsh, cold climates.</p>
