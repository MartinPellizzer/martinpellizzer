<p>Saxifraga spruneri subsp.</p>
<p>deorum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding mountain regions. It features rosettes of dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing a frost-resistant adaptation.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
