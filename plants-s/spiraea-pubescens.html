<p>Spiraea pubescens, commonly known as the downy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems covered in soft, grayish-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Spiraea pubescens is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful form and seasonal interest.</p>
