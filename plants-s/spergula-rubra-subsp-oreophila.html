<p>Spergula rubra subsp.</p>
<p>oreophila, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a rare and specialized moss found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, often reddish-brown stems.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded rock crevices and soil, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct midrib and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
