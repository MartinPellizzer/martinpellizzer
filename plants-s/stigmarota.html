                    <h1>Stigmarota</h1>
<p>Stigmarota, commonly known as the "giant horsetail," is an extinct genus of plants that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.</p>
<p>It was a member of the lycophyte group, characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled leaves. Stigmarota had a unique root system called stigmaria, which consisted of root-like structures that anchored the plant and facilitated water and nutrient absorption. These plants played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits due to their abundance and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Their fossils are often found in coal seams, providing valuable insights into ancient plant life and ecosystems.</p>
