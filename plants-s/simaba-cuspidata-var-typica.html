<p>Simaba cuspidata var. typica, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
