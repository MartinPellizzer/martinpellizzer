<p>Salix uliginosa, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to wetlands and riparian zones in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it is capable of growing in saturated or waterlogged soils. Black willow is a fast-growing species that plays a vital role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
