The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
