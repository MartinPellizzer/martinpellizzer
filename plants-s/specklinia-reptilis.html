<p>Specklinia reptilis, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Specklinia reptilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
