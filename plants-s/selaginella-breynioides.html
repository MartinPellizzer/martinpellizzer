                    <h1>Selaginella breynioides</h1>
<p>Selaginella breynioides, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and crevices, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions.</p>
