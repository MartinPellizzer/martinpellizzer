<p>Scelochilus amboroensis, commonly known as the Amboro orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Scelochilus amboroensis is considered vulnerable and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
