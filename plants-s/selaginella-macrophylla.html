                    <h1>Selaginella macrophylla</h1>
<p>Selaginella macrophylla, commonly known as the giant spikemoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. Selaginella macrophylla is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
