<p>Saccharum pedicellare, commonly known as the clustered bamboo grass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and long, slender leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in suitable environments.</p>
