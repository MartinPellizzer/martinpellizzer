                    <h1>Spongostemma maritimum</h1>
<p>Spongostemma maritimum, commonly known as sea sponges or sea sponge grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found along rocky shores and dunes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to coastal conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
