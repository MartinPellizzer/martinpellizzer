<p>Stegolepis guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan star moss, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped clusters of small, leaf-like structures that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety coating, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Stegolepis guianensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment by contributing to the microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
