                    <h1>Spergula mauritanica</h1>
<p>Spergula mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture.</p>
