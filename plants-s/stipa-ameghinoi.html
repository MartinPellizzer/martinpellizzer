<p>Stipa ameghinoi, commonly known as the Ameghino's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
