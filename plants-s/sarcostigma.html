                    <h1>Sarcostigma</h1>
<p>Sarcostigma, commonly known as the "sac-like stigma," is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the genus *Sarcostigma* within the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is a modified stigma that is often sac-like in shape, serving as a receptive organ for pollen during pollination. This structure is typically covered in fine hairs that aid in the adherence of pollen grains. The sarcostigma plays a crucial role in the reproductive process by facilitating the transfer of genetic material.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and function make it an interesting subject in the study of plant reproductive biology.</p>
