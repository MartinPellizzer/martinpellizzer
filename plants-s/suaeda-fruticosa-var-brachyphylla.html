                    <h1>Suaeda fruticosa var. brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Suaeda fruticosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as dwarf saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it reproduces through wind pollination.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in phytoremediation to reclaim degraded lands.</p>
