<p>Salsola subaphylla, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salsola subaphylla is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
