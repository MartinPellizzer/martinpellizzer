                    <h1>Stapelia pulchella</h1>
<p>Stapelia pulchella, commonly known as the "beautiful corpse" or "stapeliopsis," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia pulchella is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
