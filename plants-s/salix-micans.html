                    <h1>Salix micans</h1>
<p>Salix micans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, ovate leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix micans is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
