<p>Schoenoplectus litoralis subsp.</p>
<p>thermalis, commonly known as the thermal cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in saline or brackish habitats, particularly in coastal areas and thermal springs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in the ecological dynamics of its wetland ecosystems.</p>
