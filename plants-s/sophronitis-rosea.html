<p>Sophronitis rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to rose-colored flowers, which are typically fragrant and have a complex structure with three sepals and three petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Sophronitis rosea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
