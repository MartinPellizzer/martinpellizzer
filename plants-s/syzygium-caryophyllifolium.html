<p>Syzygium caryophyllifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several small, edible seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
