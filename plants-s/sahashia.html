<p>Sahashia, commonly known as the bluebells, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. Sahashia species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in mountainous regions. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are generally not widely commercially grown.</p>
