                    <h1>Sphenopus divaricatus f. permicranthus</h1>
<p>Sphenopus divaricatus f. permicranthus, commonly known as the Permian cranberry plant, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its delicate, branched fronds.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique morphology with dimorphic leaves, featuring both sterile and fertile fronds that contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized indusia, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
