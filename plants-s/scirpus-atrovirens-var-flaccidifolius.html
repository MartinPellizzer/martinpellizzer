<p>Scirpus atrovirens var. flaccidifolius, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush genus Scirpus, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is typically found in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife.</p>
