                    <h1>Saccharum officinarum var. oceanicum</h1>
<p>Saccharum officinarum var. oceanicum, commonly known as the Oceanic sugarcane, is a variant of sugarcane native to tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tall stalks that are adapted to saline environments, making it highly resilient to coastal salt spray. The plant produces thick, fibrous stems that are rich in sucrose, suitable for sugar production. Its leaves are broad and serrated, often displaying a bluish-green hue due to the presence of wax on the surface.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in challenging coastal soils and its potential for sustainable agriculture in maritime regions.</p>
