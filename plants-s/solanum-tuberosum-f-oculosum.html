                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. oculosum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. oculosum, commonly known as the eye potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive eye-like nodules on the tuber surface, which are more pronounced than in typical potato varieties. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same basic growth habits as other Solanum species. It is primarily cultivated for its unique appearance rather than for culinary use.</p>
<p>The f. oculosum form is often used in horticultural displays due to its ornamental value.</p>
