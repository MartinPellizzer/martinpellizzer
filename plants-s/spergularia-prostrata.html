                    <h1>Spergularia prostrata</h1>
<p>Spergularia prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is commonly found in coastal areas, dunes, and other arid or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Spergularia prostrata is well adapted to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
