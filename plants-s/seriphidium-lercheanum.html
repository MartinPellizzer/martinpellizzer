<p>Seriphidium lercheanum, commonly known as the desert chicory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Seriphidium lercheanum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens.</p>
