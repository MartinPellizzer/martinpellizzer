                    <h1>Sagina micropetala f. imberbis</h1>
<p>Sagina micropetala f. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy ground cover.</p>
<p>The f. imberbis form is distinguished by its lack of hair on the leaves, giving it a smooth, glossy appearance.</p>
