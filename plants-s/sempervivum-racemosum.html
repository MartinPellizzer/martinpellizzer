<p>Sempervivum racemosum, commonly known as the mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Sempervivum racemosum is also known for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
