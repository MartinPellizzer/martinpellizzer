                    <h1>Salix amygdaloides var. wrightii</h1>
<p>Salix amygdaloides var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and long, pendulous catkins that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
