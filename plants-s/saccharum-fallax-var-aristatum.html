<p>Saccharum fallax var. aristatum, commonly known as the aristate sugarcane.</p>
<p>This variant is a less common subspecies of sugarcane characterized by its unique morphological features. It typically exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to standard sugarcane varieties. The plant is notable for its elongated, bristle-like structures along the leaf sheaths, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>It is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct genetic makeup and potential for hybridization with other sugarcane species.</p>
