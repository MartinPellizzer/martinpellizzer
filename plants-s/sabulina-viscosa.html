<p>Sabulina viscosa, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has a rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its sticky leaves are a distinguishing feature, aiding in water retention and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Sabulina viscosa is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
