                    <h1>Salsola cyrenaica</h1>
<p>Salsola cyrenaica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and saline environments due to its deep root system and water-storing tissues. It often forms dense stands, which can be invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Salsola cyrenaica is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and pastoral areas.</p>
