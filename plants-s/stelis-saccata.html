                    <h1>Stelis saccata</h1>
<p>Stelis saccata, commonly known as the sac-like stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive sac-like structure at the base of the flower.</p>
<p>Stelis saccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens for its unique floral characteristics.</p>
