<p>Salsola scoparia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, often growing in arid and saline environments due to its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
