<p>Sedum grandipetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Sedum grandipetalum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
