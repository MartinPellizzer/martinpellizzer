                    <h1>Scleria nervosa</h1>
<p>Scleria nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Scleria nervosa is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in shallow freshwater ecosystems.</p>
