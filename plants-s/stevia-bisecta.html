<p>Stevia bisecta, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural sweetener, making it a popular alternative to sugar.</p>
<p>Stevia bisecta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for both ornamental and commercial cultivation.</p>
