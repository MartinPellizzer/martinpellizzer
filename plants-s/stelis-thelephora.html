<p>Stelis thelephora, commonly known as the orchid mantis orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, which is an adaptation for camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the shape of a mantis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Stelis thelephora is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and unusual morphology.</p>
