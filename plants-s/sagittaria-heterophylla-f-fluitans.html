<p>Sagittaria heterophylla f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique adaptation to aquatic environments, with its leaves floating on the water surface while its roots are submerged. The plant has long, narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often green or reddish in color. It produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, typically in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
