                    <h1>Spiraea gemmata</h1>
<p>Spiraea gemmata, commonly known as the gemmed spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its profuse display of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant produces numerous vegetative gemmae, which are small, plantlet-like structures that aid in its propagation. Spiraea gemmata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
