                    <h1>Sabulina tenuifolia var. macneillii</h1>
<p>Sabulina tenuifolia var. macneillii, commonly known as the slenderleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
