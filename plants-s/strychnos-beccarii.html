                    <h1>Strychnos beccarii</h1>
<p>Strychnos beccarii, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange berries that are toxic due to the presence of strychnine and brucine. Its botanical features include woody stems, opposite branching, and a distinctive calyx that persists on the fruit.</p>
<p>Strychnos beccarii is often found in open woodlands and is used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution.</p>
