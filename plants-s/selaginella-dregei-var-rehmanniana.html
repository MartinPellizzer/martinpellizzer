<p>Selaginella dregei var. rehmanniana, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen, terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a low-growing, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged.
