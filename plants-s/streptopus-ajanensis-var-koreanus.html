                    <h1>Streptopus ajanensis var. koreanus</h1>
<p>Streptopus ajanensis var. koreanus, commonly known as the Korean starwort, is a rare and distinctive member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
