                    <h1>Schoenus aggregatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in muddy or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenus aggregatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
