<p>Siphoboea, commonly known as the silverleaf siphoboea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in coastal and rocky habitats. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a striking silver or white hue. Siphoboea species typically have narrow, leathery leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and unique appearance, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely grown outside their native range.</p>
