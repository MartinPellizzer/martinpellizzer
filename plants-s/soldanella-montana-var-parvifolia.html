                    <h1>Soldanella montana var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Soldanella montana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other forms of Soldanella montana.</p>
