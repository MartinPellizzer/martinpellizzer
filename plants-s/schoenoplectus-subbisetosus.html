<p>Schoenoplectus subbisetosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers in the summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species for wetland restoration.</p>
