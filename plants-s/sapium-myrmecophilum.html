                    <h1>Sapium myrmecophilum</h1>
<p>Sapium myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense foliage and unique ability to host ants in specialized hollow structures called domatia. These domatia provide shelter for ant colonies, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture and can vary in color from green to reddish hues.</p>
<p>Sapium myrmecophilum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
