<p>Senecio glaucus subsp.</p>
<p>glaucus, commonly known as the blueweed or glaucous groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue to gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
