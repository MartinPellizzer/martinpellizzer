<p>Salix lapponum subsp.</p>
<p>helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
