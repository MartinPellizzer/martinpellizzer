                    <h1>Spartochloa scirpoidea</h1>
<p>Spartochloa scirpoidea, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Spartochloa scirpoidea plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity.</p>
