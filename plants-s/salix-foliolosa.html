                    <h1>Salix foliolosa</h1>
<p>Salix foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix foliolosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
