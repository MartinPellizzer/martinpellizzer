<p>Syncolostemon eriocephalus, commonly known as the woolly tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it a woolly appearance. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Syncolostemon eriocephalus is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
