                    <h1>Sclerocarpus papposus</h1>
<p>Sclerocarpus papposus, commonly known as the desert bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the fruit develops into a hard, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sclerocarpus papposus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
