<p>Sedum ciliare, commonly known as the threadleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thread-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum ciliare is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established.</p>
