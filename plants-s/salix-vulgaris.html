                    <h1>Salix vulgaris</h1>
<p>Salix vulgaris, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green and covered in a fine down. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows along streambanks and moist soils.</p>
<p>Salix vulgaris is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
