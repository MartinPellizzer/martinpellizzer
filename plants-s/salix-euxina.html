                    <h1>Salix euxina</h1>
<p>Salix euxina, commonly known as the Crimean willow, is a shrub native to the southern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
