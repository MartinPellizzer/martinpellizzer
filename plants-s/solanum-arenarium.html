<p>Solanum arenarium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, purple or yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption.</p>
