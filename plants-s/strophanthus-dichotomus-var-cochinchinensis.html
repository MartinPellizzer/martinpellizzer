                    <h1>Strophanthus dichotomus var. cochinchinensis</h1>
<p>Strophanthus dichotomus var. cochinchinensis, commonly known as the red-flowered strophanthus, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and cardiac glycosides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for medicinal use.</p>
