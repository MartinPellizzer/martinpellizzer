<p>Salicornia foliosa, commonly known as sea beet, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding survival in coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt tolerance makes it valuable for soil stabilization and phytoremediation.</p>
<p>Salicornia foliosa is also edible, with a salty, crisp texture often used in gourmet cuisine.</p>
