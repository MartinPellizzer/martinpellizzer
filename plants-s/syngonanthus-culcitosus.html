                    <h1>Syngonanthus culcitosus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus culcitosus, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, red berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the hostâ€™s vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
