                    <h1>Salix grandifolia var. lancifolia</h1>
<p>Salix grandifolia var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
