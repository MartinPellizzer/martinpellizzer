                    <h1>Stellaster polycephalus</h1>
<p>Stellaster polycephalus, commonly known as the many-headed starburst, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the family Stellasteridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped body with numerous small, calcareous plates forming its skeleton. This species is typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are located on the central disc, and it exhibits asexual reproduction through budding.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its skeletal structure has led to its classification within the phylum Echinodermata, despite its lack of true plant characteristics.</p>
