                    <h1>Salix longifolia</h1>
<p>Salix longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or greyish down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>The leaves and branches are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
