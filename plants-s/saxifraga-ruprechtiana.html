                    <h1>Saxifraga ruprechtiana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ruprechtiana, commonly known as the Ruprecht's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of silver-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
