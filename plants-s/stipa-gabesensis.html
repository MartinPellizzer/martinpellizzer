<p>Stipa gabesensis, commonly known as the Gabes needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Tunisia and Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas or along cliffs.

Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray.</p>
<p>Stipa gabesensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
