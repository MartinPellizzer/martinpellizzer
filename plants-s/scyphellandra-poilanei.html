                    <h1>Scyphellandra poilanei</h1>
<p>Scyphellandra poilanei, commonly known as the Poirine's scyphellum, is a rare and elusive fungal species belonging to the family Trichocomaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, resupinate fruiting bodies that often appear as small, clustered structures on decaying wood. The basidiomycete's hyphae are typically colorless and branched, forming a complex network that aids in nutrient absorption from its substrate. Its spores are produced in small, club-shaped basidia and are released in abundance under suitable environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and cryptic growth habits, Scyphellandra poilanei remains poorly understood and rarely encountered in the wild.</p>
