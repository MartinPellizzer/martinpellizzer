<p>Selaginella viticulosa, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a compact rosette pattern, which helps retain moisture. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Selaginella viticulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate low light conditions.</p>
