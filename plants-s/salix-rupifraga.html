                    <h1>Salix rupifraga</h1>
<p>Salix rupifraga, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on steep slopes. The plant has slender, often twisted branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Salix rupifraga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
