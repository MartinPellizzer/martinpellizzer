                    <h1>Sedum subtile var. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Sedum subtile var. caespitosum, commonly known as the mossy stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
