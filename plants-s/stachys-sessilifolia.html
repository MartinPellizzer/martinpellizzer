                    <h1>Stachys sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Stachys sessilifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Stachys sessilifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
