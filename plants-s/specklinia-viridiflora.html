<p>Specklinia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their subdued color. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the pale flowers.</p>
<p>Specklinia viridiflora is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
