<p>Suaeda chenopodioides, commonly known as sea spurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions where it tolerates high salinity and extreme temperatures. Its robust root system helps it retain water in dry conditions, while its thick leaves reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
