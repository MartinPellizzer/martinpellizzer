<p>Schmidelia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Schmidelia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
