<p>Salvia polystachia var. seorsa, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in dense whorls along the stems. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer.</p>
