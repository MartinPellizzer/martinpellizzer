                            <h1>Sorghum Zeae</h1>
<p>Sorghum, scientifically known as Sorghum zeae, is a versatile and drought-resistant cereal grain native to Africa. It has been cultivated for thousands of years and is now grown in many parts of the world, including the United States, India, and China. This plant is valued for its high nutritional content, including proteins, fibers, and essential minerals. Sorghum is also used in a variety of food products, such as flour, beverages, and animal feed. Its adaptability to poor soil conditions makes it an important crop for sustainable agriculture.</p>
