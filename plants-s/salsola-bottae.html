<p>Salsola bottae, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Salsola bottae plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
