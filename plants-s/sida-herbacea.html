<p>Sida herbacea, commonly known as seaside flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or saline soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sida herbacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
