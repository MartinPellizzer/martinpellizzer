                    <h1>Sporobolus setarioides</h1>
<p>Sporobolus setarioides, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus setarioides is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
