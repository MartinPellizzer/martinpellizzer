<p>Solanum delagoense var. tomentellum is a lesser-known member of the nightshade family native to southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its unique features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
