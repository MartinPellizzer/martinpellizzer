<p>Sesuvium digynum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved sea lavender, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, narrow, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and arid environments. It grows in dense mats or low shrubs, often forming extensive colonies along rocky shores and dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
