                    <h1>Selaginella arenicola</h1>
<p>Selaginella arenicola, commonly known as the sand spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to survive in extreme conditions, Selaginella arenicola is often used in xerophytic gardens and as a specimen plant in arid landscapes.</p>
