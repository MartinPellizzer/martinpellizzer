                    <h1>Satyrium princeae</h1>
<p>Satyrium princeae, commonly known as the Prince's ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its delicate appearance and restricted habitat make it a rare and protected species.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
