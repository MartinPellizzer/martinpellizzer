                    <h1>Sarcococca pruniformis var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Sarcococca pruniformis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the compact sarcococca, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, mounded growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover in shaded areas. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by red berries that persist through the winter. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical sarcococca, making it suitable for smaller spaces and rock gardens.</p>
