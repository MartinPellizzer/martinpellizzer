                    <h1>Sclerotheca forsteri</h1>
<p>Sclerotheca forsteri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Sclerotheca forsteri plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient soils.</p>
