                    <h1>Salsola smithii</h1>
<p>Salsola smithii, commonly known as Smith's saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, salt-tolerant berries. Salsola smithii is often found in sandy soils and is a key component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important plant for soil stabilization and wildlife habitat.</p>
