<p>Sclerocarpus frutescens, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sclerocarpus frutescens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its woody structure and deep root system allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
