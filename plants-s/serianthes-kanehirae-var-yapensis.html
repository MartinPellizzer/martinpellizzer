<p>Serianthes kanehirae var. yapensis, commonly known as the Yap ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species with significant ecological and cultural importance to the local communities.</p>
