<p>Selaginella wightii var. phillipsiana, commonly known as the Indian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate sporophylls, which are specialized leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water retention mechanisms.</p>
