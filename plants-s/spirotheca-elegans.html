<p>Spirotheca elegans, commonly known as the elegant spirotheca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the leaf axils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Spirotheca elegans is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
