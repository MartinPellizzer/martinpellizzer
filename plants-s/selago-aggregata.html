                    <h1>Selago aggregata</h1>
<p>Selago aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Selago aggregata is often found in dunes and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
