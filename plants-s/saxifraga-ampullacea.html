                    <h1>Saxifraga ampullacea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ampullacea, commonly known as the bladder saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a notable species in botanical studies of cold-climate flora.</p>
