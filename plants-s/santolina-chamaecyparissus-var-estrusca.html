The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact, rounded inflorescences. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its foliage is also used in aromatherapy and herbal remedies for its calming properties.</p>
