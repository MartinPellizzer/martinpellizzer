                            <h1>Selinum Ponticum</h1>
<p>Sow thistle, scientifically known as Selinum ponticum, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is commonly found in moist meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability. The plant is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Despite its common presence, it is often mistaken for other similar species due to its subtle appearance. Sow thistle has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures throughout history.</p>
