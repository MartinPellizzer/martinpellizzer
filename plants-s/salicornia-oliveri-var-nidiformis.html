                    <h1>Salicornia oliveri var. nidiformis</h1>
<p>Salicornia oliveri var. nidiformis, commonly known as the clustered glasswort, is a halophyte species that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
