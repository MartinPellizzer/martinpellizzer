                    <h1>Sieglingia nealleyi</h1>
<p>Sieglingia nealleyi, commonly known as the Nealley's sieve-ferns, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble a sieve, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sieglingia nealleyi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
