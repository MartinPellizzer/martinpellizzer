<p>Sedum ramosum, commonly known as the bushy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care.</p>
