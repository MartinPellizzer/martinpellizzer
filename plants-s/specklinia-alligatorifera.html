<p>Specklinia alligatorifera, commonly known as the alligator fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble the scales of an alligator, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, and it requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs.</p>
<p>Specklinia alligatorifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often sought after by collectors and horticulturists.</p>
