<p>Salomonia martini, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces bright red, orange, or yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences resembling a star. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>Salomonia martini is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils.</p>
