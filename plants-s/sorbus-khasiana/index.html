                            <h1>Sorbus Khasiana</h1>
<p>Khasi whitebeam, scientifically known as Sorbus khasiana, is a rare and endemic tree species found exclusively in the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya. This deciduous tree is characterized by its smooth, white-barked trunk and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in the cool, moist climates of the Khasi Hills, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, the Khasi whitebeam is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a valuable subject for botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
