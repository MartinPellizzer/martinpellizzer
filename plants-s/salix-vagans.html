<p>Salix vagans, commonly known as the wandering willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, drooping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, yellowish female flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Salix vagans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
