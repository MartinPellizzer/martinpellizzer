<p>Scirpus tuberosus subsp.</p>
<p>affinis, commonly known as the swamp arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
