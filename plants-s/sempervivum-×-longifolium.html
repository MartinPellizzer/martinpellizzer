                    <h1>Sempervivum × longifolium</h1>
<p>Sempervivum × longifolium, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a hybrid succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces offsets, or "chicks," around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a hardy and low-maintenance plant.</p>
