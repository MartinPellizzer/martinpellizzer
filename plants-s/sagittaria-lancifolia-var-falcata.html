<p>Sagittaria lancifolia var. falcata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, with a distinct notch at the base. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense underwater mats.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
