<p>Salix hegetschweileri subsp.</p>
<p>vosegiaca, commonly known as the Vosegiaca willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
