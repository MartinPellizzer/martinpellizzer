                    <h1>Selaginella poeppigiana</h1>
<p>Selaginella poeppigiana, commonly known as the "resurrection plant," is a unique species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that can survive extreme desiccation, losing up to 95% of its water content and appearing dead, only to revive when rehydrated. The plant has a creeping, branched structure with small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to regions in South America, Africa, and Asia.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand drought makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticulture.</p>
