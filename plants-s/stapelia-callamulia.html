<p>Stapelia callamulia, commonly known as the "corpse flower," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often described as resembling decaying flesh, a trait that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its flowers are typically yellowish-green with prominent veins, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Stapelia callamulia is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
