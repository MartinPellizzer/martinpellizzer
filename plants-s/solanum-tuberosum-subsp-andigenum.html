<p>andigenum, commonly known as the Andean potato, is a wild relative of the domesticated potato. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America and is characterized by its tubers, which are typically smaller and more robust than those of cultivated varieties.</p>
<p>This subspecies exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, including differences in tuber shape, color, and size. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and has a high genetic diversity, making it valuable for breeding programs.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its resistance to certain diseases and environmental stresses.</p>
