<p>Schousboea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that are often described as heart-shaped. The plant is native to the island of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schousboea cordifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
