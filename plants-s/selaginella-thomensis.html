<p>Selaginella thomensis, commonly known as the Thomas's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Mozambique.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with delicate, needle-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cellular structures. It reproduces via spores, and its sporophyte stage is typically short-lived.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
