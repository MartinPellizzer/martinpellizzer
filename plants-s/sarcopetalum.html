                    <h1>Sarcopetalum</h1>
<p>Sarcopetalum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The genus includes several species, such as Sarcopetalum longifolium, which is known for its striking purple or pink flowers. Sarcopetalum plants are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them valuable for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies in desert ecosystems.</p>
