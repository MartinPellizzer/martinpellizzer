<p>Sclerothrix, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often showy flowers that are adapted to grow in rocky or crevice habitats. The plants typically have a short, rhizomatous stem and produce small, clustered flowers with intricate petal structures. Sclerothrix species are native to regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-suited for xerophytic environments, where they thrive with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
