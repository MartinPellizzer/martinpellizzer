                    <h1>Sorocea</h1>
<p>Sorocea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Sorocea is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
