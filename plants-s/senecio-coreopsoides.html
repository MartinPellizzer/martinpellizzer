                    <h1>Senecio coreopsoides</h1>
<p>Senecio coreopsoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation across open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Senecio coreopsoides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to desert and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
