                    <h1>Solanum umbelliferum var. obispoense</h1>
<p>Solanum umbelliferum var. obispoense, commonly known as the Obispo's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and it has hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other solanum species. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes.</p>
