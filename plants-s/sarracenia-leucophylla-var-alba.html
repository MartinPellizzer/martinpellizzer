                    <h1>Sarracenia leucophylla var. alba</h1>
<p>Sarracenia leucophylla var. alba, commonly known as the white-tongued pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps, which secrete a digestive fluid to break down insects. The plant's white, waxy interior of the pitcher gives it its distinctive appearance, and it often has a red or purple coloration along the rim. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by growers for its ornamental value and unique predatory behavior.</p>
