                    <h1>Schizachne purpurascens var. callosa</h1>
<p>Schizachne purpurascens var. callosa, commonly known as the hairy purple grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to reddish-brown inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, often in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered and can be either paniculate or spikelike in structure.</p>
