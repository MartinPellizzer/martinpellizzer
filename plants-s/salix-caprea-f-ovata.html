                    <h1>Salix caprea f. ovata</h1>
<p>Salix caprea f. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring form of Salix caprea, characterized by its ovate, lance-shaped leaves that are often more rounded than those of the typical species. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination cycles.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grey, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
