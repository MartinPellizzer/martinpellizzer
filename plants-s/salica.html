                    <h1>Salica</h1>
<p>Salica, commonly known as willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae.</p>
<p>It includes over 200 species, most of which are shrubs or small trees characterized by their slender branches and heart-shaped leaves. The bark of many salica species is gray or reddish and often peels in thin layers. These plants are often found near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to their preference for moist soils.</p>
<p>Salica species are also known for their medicinal properties, particularly the anti-inflammatory compound salicin, which is the basis for aspirin.</p>
