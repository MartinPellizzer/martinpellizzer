                    <h1>Senecio bairdii</h1>
<p>Senecio bairdii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Senecio bairdii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
