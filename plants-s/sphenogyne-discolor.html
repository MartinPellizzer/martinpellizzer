<p>Sphenogyne discolor, commonly known as the spotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with small, white or pale spots. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Sphenogyne discolor is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ability to thrive in water-saturated soils.</p>
