                    <h1>Selaginella liboensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella liboensis, commonly known as the Libo spikemoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphological feature of producing spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Selaginella liboensis is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat destruction and over-collection for horticultural purposes.</p>
