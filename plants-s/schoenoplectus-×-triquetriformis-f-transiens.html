                    <h1>Schoenoplectus × triquetriformis f. transiens</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus × triquetriformis f. transiens, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a hybrid wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or moist soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the margins of slow-moving water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water.</p>
