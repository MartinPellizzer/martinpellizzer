<p>Scorpiurus minimus, commonly known as the small sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seed capsules dehisce to release tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Scorpiurus minimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
