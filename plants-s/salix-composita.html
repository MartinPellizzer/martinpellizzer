                    <h1>Salix composita</h1>
<p>Salix composita, commonly known as the composite willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its roots are known for their extensive network, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Salix composita is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of lightweight timber.</p>
