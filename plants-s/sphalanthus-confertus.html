                    <h1>Sphalanthus confertus</h1>
<p>Sphalanthus confertus, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Sphalanthus confertus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
