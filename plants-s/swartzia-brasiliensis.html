<p>Swartzia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite, and leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale pink, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.</p>
