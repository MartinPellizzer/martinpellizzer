                    <h1>Stenolobium molle</h1>
<p>Stenolobium molle, commonly known as the silky tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in drooping clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Stenolobium molle is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
