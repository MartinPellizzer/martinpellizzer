                    <h1>Salix angustata</h1>
<p>Salix angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Salix angustata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
