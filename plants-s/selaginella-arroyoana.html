                    <h1>Selaginella arroyoana</h1>
<p>Selaginella arroyoana, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with spirally arranged leaves. The plant has a unique ability to survive in dry conditions due to its thick, waxy cuticle and ability to enter a state of dormancy. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Selaginella arroyoana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
