<p>Solanum tuberosum subsp.</p>
<p>guaraniticum, commonly known as the Guarani potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato native to South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the standard potato.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and exhibits features typical of the genus Solanum, including hairy stems and showy flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific environmental conditions.</p>
