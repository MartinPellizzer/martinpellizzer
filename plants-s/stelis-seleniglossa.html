                    <h1>Stelis seleniglossa</h1>
<p>Stelis seleniglossa, commonly known as the silver-tongued stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
