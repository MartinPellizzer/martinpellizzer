                    <h1>Symphytum asperum</h1>
<p>Symphytum asperum, commonly known as the rough beggar-ticks, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain regions and is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
