                    <h1>Selaginella flabellatiformis</h1>
<p>Selaginella flabellatiformis, commonly known as the clubmoss fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common in many primitive vascular plants. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the spore-producing organs.</p>
<p>Selaginella flabellatiformis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
