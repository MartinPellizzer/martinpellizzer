<p>Stegolepis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous marsh hibiscus, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, and it is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where embryos develop inside the fruit before maturity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
