<p>Sempervivum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, pointed leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces clusters of bright red or pink flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Sempervivum alpinum is popular as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
