<p>Selaginella protensa, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when dry and reviving when rehydrated. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>Selaginella protensa is widely studied for its remarkable resilience and potential applications in biotechnology and agriculture.</p>
