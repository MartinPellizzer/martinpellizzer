                    <h1>Stylocline masonii</h1>
<p>Stylocline masonii, commonly known as the Mason's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbage and broccoli. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Stylocline masonii is adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes where it can access limited nutrients and moisture.</p>
