<p>Solanum mandonis var. dryophyllum, commonly known as the dry leaf nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale purple. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its berries, which are toxic, are an important food source for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
