                    <h1>Salix tetrasperma</h1>
<p>Salix tetrasperma, commonly known as the four-seeded willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often swampy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive four-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>Salix tetrasperma is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
