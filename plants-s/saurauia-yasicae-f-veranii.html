<p>Saurauia yasicae f. veranii, commonly known as the Vanuatu saurauia, is a rare and unique plant endemic to the island of Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and other shrubs adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
