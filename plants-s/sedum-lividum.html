<p>Sedum lividum, commonly known as blue stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum lividum is also known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh conditions, contributing to its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
