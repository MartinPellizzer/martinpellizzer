                    <h1>Schmidelia villosa</h1>
<p>Schmidelia villosa, commonly known as the hairy schmidelia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with soft, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Schmidelia villosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
