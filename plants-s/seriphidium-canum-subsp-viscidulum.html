<p>Seriphidium canum subsp.</p>
<p>viscidulum, commonly known as sticky horseweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in dry environments.</p>
