                    <h1>Sticherus cundinamarcensis</h1>
<p>Sticherus cundinamarcensis, commonly known as the Cundinamarca fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
