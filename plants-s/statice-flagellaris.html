                    <h1>Statice flagellaris</h1>
<p>Statice flagellaris, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Statice flagellaris is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
