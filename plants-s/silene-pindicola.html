<p>Silene pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
