<p>Selliguea translucens, commonly known as the translucent liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its leaves are thin and closely packed, with a translucent appearance due to the presence of specialized cells. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from tiny structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Selliguea translucens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
