<p>Smelowskia tilingii, commonly known as the Tilingii's smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Smelowskia tilingii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
