                    <h1>Sorbus aucuparia f. asplenifolia</h1>
<p>Sorbus aucuparia f. asplenifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved rowan, is a botanical variant of the common rowan tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, almost fern-like leaves that resemble those of the ivy plant. This form typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a notable ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
