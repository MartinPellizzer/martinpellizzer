                    <h1>Senegalia miersii</h1>
<p>Senegalia miersii, commonly known as the Miers' acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Senegalia miersii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
