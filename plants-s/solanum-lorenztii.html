                    <h1>Solanum lorenztii</h1>
<p>Solanum lorenztii, commonly known as the Lorentz's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
