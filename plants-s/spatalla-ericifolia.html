                    <h1>Spatalla ericifolia</h1>
<p>Spatalla ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Spatalla ericifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
