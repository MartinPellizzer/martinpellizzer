                    <h1>Scirpus niloticus</h1>
<p>Scirpus niloticus, commonly known as the nilotic sedge, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus niloticus is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching in some regions.</p>
