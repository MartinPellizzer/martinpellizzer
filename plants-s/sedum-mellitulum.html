<p>Sedum mellitulum, commonly known as honey-sedum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial succulent that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Sedum mellitulum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
