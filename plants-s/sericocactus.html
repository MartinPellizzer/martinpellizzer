<p>Sericocactus, commonly known as the silky cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the plant's rugged appearance. Sericocactus species are generally low-growing and well adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments they inhabit.</p>
<p>These plants are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
