                    <h1>Spergella saginoides</h1>
<p>Spergella saginoides, commonly known as the sheep's wool or wooly moss, is a small, cushion-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of specialized structures called pseudoparaphyllidia. The plant lacks true leaves but has thalloid structures that are rich in chlorophyll, allowing it to perform photosynthesis efficiently. It is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Spergella saginoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
