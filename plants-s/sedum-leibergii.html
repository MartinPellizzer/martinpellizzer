<p>Sedum leibergii, commonly known as the stonecrop or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in summer. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Sedum leibergii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
