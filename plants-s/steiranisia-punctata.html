                    <h1>Steiranisia punctata</h1>
<p>Steiranisia punctata, commonly known as the punctate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often red or orange in color. It is native to parts of South America and is adapted to grow in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
