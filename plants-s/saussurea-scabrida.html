                    <h1>Saussurea scabrida</h1>
<p>Saussurea scabrida, commonly known as the rough safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its fibrous roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Saussurea scabrida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>
