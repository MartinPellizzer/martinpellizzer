                    <h1>Scirpus americanus var. conglomeratus</h1>
<p>Scirpus americanus var. conglomeratus, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and forms tussocks or clumps, which help stabilize soil in marshy environments. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
