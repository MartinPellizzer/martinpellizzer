                    <h1>Stellaria media var. transiens</h1>
<p>Stellaria media var. transiens, commonly known as the transient mouse-ear or transient chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and garden beds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter flowering period compared to the typical Stellaria media.</p>
