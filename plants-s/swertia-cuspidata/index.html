                            <h1>Swertia Cuspidata</h1>
<p>Cuspidate swertia, scientifically known as Swertia cuspidata, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This herbaceous plant is characterized by its vivid blue or purple flowers and lanceolate leaves with a distinct pointed tip, giving it its common name. Despite its beauty, it remains a lesser-known species, often overlooked in botanical discussions due to its limited distribution. Growing in cool, moist environments, it thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of growing interest among botanists and conservationists.</p>
