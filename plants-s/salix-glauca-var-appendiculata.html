                    <h1>Salix glauca var. appendiculata</h1>
<p>Salix glauca var. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or whitish bloom. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its role in early season pollination networks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it is a valuable species for wetland restoration and wildlife habitat support.</p>
