                    <h1>Sphaeradenia quitoensis</h1>
<p>Sphaeradenia quitoensis, commonly known as the Quito spleenwort, is a member of the family Polychaspidaceae and is native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
