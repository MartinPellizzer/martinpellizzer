                    <h1>Sedum dasyphyllum var. glutinosum</h1>
<p>Sedum dasyphyllum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to further aid in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
