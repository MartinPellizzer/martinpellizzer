<p>Stenocereus, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, columnar stems and often bear clusters of spines. They are drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. Some species produce yellow or white flowers, typically in spring or summer.</p>
<p>The fruit, when ripe, is edible and has a sweet, melon-like flavor.</p>
