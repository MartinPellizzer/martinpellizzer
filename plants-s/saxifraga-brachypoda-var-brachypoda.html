                    <h1>Saxifraga brachypoda var. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Saxifraga brachypoda var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
