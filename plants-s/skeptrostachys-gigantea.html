                    <h1>Skeptrostachys gigantea</h1>
<p>Skeptrostachys gigantea, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
