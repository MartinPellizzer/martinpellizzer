                    <h1>Sanblasia dressleri</h1>
<p>Sanblasia dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's sanblasia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
