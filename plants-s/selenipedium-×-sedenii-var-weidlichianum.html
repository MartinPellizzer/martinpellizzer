                    <h1>Selenipedium × sedenii var. weidlichianum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium × sedenii var. weidlichianum, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
