The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
