                    <h1>Salix scopulicola</h1>
<p>Salix scopulicola, commonly known as the rock willow, is a small, shrub-like willow species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in desert environments where water is scarce. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer to reduce water loss. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Salix scopulicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
