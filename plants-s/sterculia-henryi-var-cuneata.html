                    <h1>Sterculia henryi var. cuneata</h1>
<p>Sterculia henryi var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sterculia, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies.</p>
