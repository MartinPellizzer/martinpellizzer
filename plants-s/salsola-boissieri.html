                    <h1>Salsola boissieri</h1>
<p>Salsola boissieri, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with dense, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Salsola boissieri is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
