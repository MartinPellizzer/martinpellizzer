<p>Sedum viguieri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates.</p>
