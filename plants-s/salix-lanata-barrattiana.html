<p>Salix lanata barrattiana, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
