                    <h1>Stevia vigintiseta</h1>
<p>Stevia vigintiseta, commonly known as the twenty-branched sweetleaf, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Stevia genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are covered in fine, white hairs, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Stevia vigintiseta contains high levels of steviol glycosides, making it a potential natural sweetener.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
