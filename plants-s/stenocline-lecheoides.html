<p>Stenocline lecheoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically arranged in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Stenocline lecheoides is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
