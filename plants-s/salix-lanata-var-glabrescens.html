                    <h1>Salix lanata var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Salix lanata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky willow, is a variant of the silky dogwood, characterized by its soft, silken hairs on the branches and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and turn yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
