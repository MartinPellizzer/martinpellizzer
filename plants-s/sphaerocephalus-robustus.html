                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus robustus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus robustus, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth form with a central thallus that is globular or hemispherical in shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are embedded within the thallus, which is a common feature among liverworts.</p>
<p>Sphaerocephalus robustus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
