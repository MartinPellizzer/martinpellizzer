                    <h1>Salix × pseudodoniana</h1>
<p>Salix × pseudodoniana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
