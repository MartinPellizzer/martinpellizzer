                    <h1>Selaginella neospringiana</h1>
<p>Selaginella neospringiana, commonly known as the Neospring's spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern ally native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, allowing it to retain water efficiently. Its morphology includes small, scale-like leaves and a short, creeping stem.</p>
<p>Selaginella neospringiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
