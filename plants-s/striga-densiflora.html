                    <h1>Striga densiflora</h1>
<p>Striga densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered densely along its stem. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, and it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and potential economic impact, it is considered a weed of agricultural concern in certain regions.</p>
