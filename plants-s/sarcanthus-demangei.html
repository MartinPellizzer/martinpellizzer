                    <h1>Sarcanthus demangei</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus demangei, commonly known as the Demange's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and unique, almost spectral appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, contributing to its mysterious allure.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, Sarcanthus demangei is considered a conservation priority in its native region.</p>
