                    <h1>Solenangis</h1>
<p>Solenangis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a single, slender stem with a few leaves and produces its flowers directly from the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and endangered status, Solenangis is highly protected and difficult to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
