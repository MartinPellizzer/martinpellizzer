<p>Salix stoibergensis, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the soil in rocky and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Salix stoibergensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
