                    <h1>Salix phlebophylla f. minor</h1>
<p>Salix phlebophylla f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a unique variant of the willow family native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing no taller than 30 centimeters, with slender, often pendulous branches. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It blooms with catkins in the spring, producing both male and female flowers on the same plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
