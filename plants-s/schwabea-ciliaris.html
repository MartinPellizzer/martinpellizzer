                    <h1>Schwabea ciliaris</h1>
<p>Schwabea ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf schwabea, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Schwabea ciliaris is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>
