<p>Sarracenia nutans, commonly known as the nodding pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its downward-curving, urn-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a waxy coating that helps in trapping prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Sarracenia nutans is an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through its insectivorous habits.</p>
