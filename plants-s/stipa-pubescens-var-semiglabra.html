<p>Stipa pubescens var. semiglabra, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and steppe environments.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions.</p>
