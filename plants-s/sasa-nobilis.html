                    <h1>Sasa nobilis</h1>
<p>Sasa nobilis, commonly known as Japanese bamboo or black bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect culms that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a dark green to almost black stem that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, followed by triangular, papery bracts that persist through the winter. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective groundcover in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Sasa nobilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shaded woodland conditions.</p>
