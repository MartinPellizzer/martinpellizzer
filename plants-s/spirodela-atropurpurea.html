                    <h1>Spirodela atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Spirodela atropurpurea, commonly known as purple water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically purple or reddish in color, which help it absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, emerging from the leaf axils. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread rapidly in water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its fast growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native environments, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
