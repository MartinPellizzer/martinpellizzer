                    <h1>Sarcotheca laxa var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Sarcotheca laxa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sarcocarpa, is a variant of the sarcocarpa genus characterized by its hairy or pubescent surface.</p>
<p>It is a type of lichen, specifically a foliose lichen, which means it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant typically grows on bark, soil, or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its thallus is usually green to yellowish in color, and it reproduces through the release of spores from its apothecia.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
