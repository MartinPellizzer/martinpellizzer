                    <h1>Sporobolus rigens f. atacamensis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus rigens f. atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama spikerush, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of dust or salt due to its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert.</p>
