<p>Styphelia hookeri, commonly known as the Hookerâ€™s wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a fine white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers during the late winter to early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and birds. Styphelia hookeri is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
