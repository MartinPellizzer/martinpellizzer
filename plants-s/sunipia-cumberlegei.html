                <h1>Sunipia cumberlegei</h1>
<p>Sunipia cumberlegei, commonly known as the Cumberlege sunflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange petals and a tall, slender stem that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sunipia cumberlegei is considered an endangered species.</p>
