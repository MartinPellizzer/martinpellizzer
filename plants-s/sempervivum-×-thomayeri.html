<p>Sempervivum × thomayeri, commonly known as the 'Thomayer's Hens and Chicks,' is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months.</p>
<p>Sempervivum × thomayeri is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
