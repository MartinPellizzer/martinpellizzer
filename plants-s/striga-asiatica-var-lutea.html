<p>Striga asiatica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellowish stems and leaves.

Its small, white to yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a significant agricultural weed in many regions.</p>
