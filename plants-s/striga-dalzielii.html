                    <h1>Striga dalzielii</h1>
<p>Striga dalzielii, commonly known as the Dalziel's witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in southern and eastern parts. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken or even kill the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and potential impact on agriculture, Striga dalzielii is considered a weed of economic importance in some areas.</p>
