                    <h1>Salix fursaevii</h1>
<p>Salix fursaevii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
