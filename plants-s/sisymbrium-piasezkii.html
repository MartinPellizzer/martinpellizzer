<p>Sisymbrium piasezkii, commonly known as the Piasezkii's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and derives its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological interactions of its habitat.</p>
