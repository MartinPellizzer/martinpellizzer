<p>Stelis orectopus, commonly known as the erect-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Stelis orectopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
