<p>It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble a heart shape.

Solanum panduriforme is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native range.</p>
