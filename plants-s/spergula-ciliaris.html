                    <h1>Spergula ciliaris</h1>
<p>Spergula ciliaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Spergula ciliaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
