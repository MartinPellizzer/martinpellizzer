<p>Sporobolus sarmentosus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, creeping growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Sporobolus sarmentosus also plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
