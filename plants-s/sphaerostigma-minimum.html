                    <h1>Sphaerostigma minimum</h1>
<p>Sphaerostigma minimum, commonly known as the small globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil in humid, temperate regions. The plant has a complex symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a layered structure with a central, rounded body and a fringed margin.</p>
<p>Sphaerostigma minimum is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental health.</p>
