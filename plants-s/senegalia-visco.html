                    <h1>Senegalia visco</h1>
<p>Senegalia visco, commonly known as gum arabic tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a white, sticky resin known as gum arabic, which is harvested from the bark and used in food, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Senegalia visco plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
