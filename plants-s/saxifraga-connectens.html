                    <h1>Saxifraga connectens</h1>
<p>Saxifraga connectens, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga connectens is often found in alpine tundra and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
