<p>Stenogyne diffusa, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically violet to purple in color, which attract native pollinators such as bees and birds. Stenogyne diffusa is known for its hard, heavy wood, which was historically used by Native Hawaiians for various tools and ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is now considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
