<p>Sinobaijiania smitinandii, commonly known as the Smitinandii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
