                    <h1>Saussurea atrata</h1>
<p>Saussurea atrata, commonly known as the black safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy composite flower heads that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>Saussurea atrata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
