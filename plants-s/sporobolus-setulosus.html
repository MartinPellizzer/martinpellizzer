<p>Sporobolus setulosus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive silky, hairy leaves that give it a soft appearance. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>Silky wheatgrass is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is also used in some traditional medicinal practices.</p>
