<p>Salvia × brozekii, commonly known as the hybrid sage, is a perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Salvia leucantha and Salvia greggii, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant features vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is gray-green and slightly hairy, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Salvia × brozekii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
