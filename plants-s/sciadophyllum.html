                    <h1>Sciadophyllum</h1>
<p>Sciadophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unusual plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like structure composed of overlapping, scale-like leaves that create a dense, protective covering. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, blending in with its surroundings. Sciadophyllum is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
