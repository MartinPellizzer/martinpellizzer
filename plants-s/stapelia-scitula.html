<p>Stapelia scitula, commonly known as the Cape Thorned Apocynum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Stapelia scitula is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
