                    <h1>Striga musselmanii</h1>
<p>Striga musselmanii, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests the roots of various grasses, including sorghum and millet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant yield loss in crops. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and agricultural impact, it is considered a major weed in many parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
