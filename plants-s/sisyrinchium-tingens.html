<p>Sisyrinchium tingens, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering herb due to its showy blooms. The plant features slender, erect stems and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Sisyrinchium tingens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
