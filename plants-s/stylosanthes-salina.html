                    <h1>Stylosanthes salina</h1>
<p>Stylosanthes salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, aiding in its ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Stylosanthes salina is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization and rehabilitation of degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its resilience to salt and drought makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
