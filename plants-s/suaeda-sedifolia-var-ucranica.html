<p>Suaeda sedifolia var. ucranica, commonly known as the Ukrainian saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or semi-prostrate, allowing it to spread across saline soils.</p>
<p>This variety is native to regions with high salinity, such as parts of Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
