                    <h1>Sisymbrium pentaphyllum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, though it does not produce typical flowers or seeds. The plant is characterized by its yellow or greenish flowers and root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
