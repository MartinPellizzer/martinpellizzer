<p>Spiraea subrotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to round in shape, with a slightly wavy margin, and turn yellow in the autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its elegant form and seasonal color changes.</p>
