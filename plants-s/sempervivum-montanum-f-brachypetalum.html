                    <h1>Sempervivum montanum f. brachypetalum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum montanum f. brachypetalum, commonly known as the compact or dwarf form of the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard species, giving it a more compact appearance. The leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
