<p>Stevia megapotamica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters, and it is often cultivated for its natural sweetening properties.</p>
<p>Stevia megapotamica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats.</p>
