<p>Sibbaldiopsis tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed sibbaldiopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adapting to the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three distinct lobes, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sibbaldiopsis tridentata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
