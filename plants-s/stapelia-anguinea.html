<p>Stapelia anguinea, commonly known as the snake plant or viper's bugloss, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often ribbed and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stapelia anguinea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
