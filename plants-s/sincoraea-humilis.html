                    <h1>Sincoraea humilis</h1>
<p>Sincoraea humilis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of gray-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sincoraea humilis is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for small livestock and wildlife.</p>
