                    <h1>Scaevola cumana</h1>
<p>Scaevola cumana, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats along sandy shores and rocky coastlines. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Scaevola cumana is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
