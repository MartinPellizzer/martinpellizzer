<p>Stelis praecipua, commonly known as the Hawaiian lady's-tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Stelis praecipua is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the unique ecosystems of its native habitats.</p>
