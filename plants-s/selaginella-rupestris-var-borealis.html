                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. borealis</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. borealis, commonly known as the northern clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its sporophyte structures are typically hidden beneath the foliage, making it less conspicuous than some other clubmoss species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates.</p>
