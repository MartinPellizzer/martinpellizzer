                    <h1>Selaginella fissidentoides var. amphirrhizos</h1>
<p>Selaginella fissidentoides var. amphirrhizos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves and a unique growth habit that includes both aerial and subterranean stems. This variety is notable for its ability to produce both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic rhizomes, which contribute to its survival in nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive structures reflect its evolutionary adaptations to arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>
