                    <h1>Streptopus streptopoides var. atrocarpus</h1>
<p>Streptopus streptopoides var. atrocarpus, commonly known as the black-veined starwort, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped leaves with dark green veins and small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, often in areas with rich, organic soil. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, soft hairs, which help retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
