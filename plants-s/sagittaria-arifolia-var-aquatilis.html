                    <h1>Sagittaria arifolia var. aquatilis</h1>
<p>Sagittaria arifolia var. aquatilis, commonly known as water arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Sagittaria arifolia var. aquatilis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediment.</p>
