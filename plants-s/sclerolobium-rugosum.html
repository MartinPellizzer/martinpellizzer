<p>Sclerolobium rugosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are rough and hairy to the touch.

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Sclerolobium rugosum is adapted to withstand drought and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
