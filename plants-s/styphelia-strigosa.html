                    <h1>Styphelia strigosa</h1>
<p>Styphelia strigosa, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in acidic, sandy or peaty soils and requires high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Styphelia strigosa is often found in heathlands and swampy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
