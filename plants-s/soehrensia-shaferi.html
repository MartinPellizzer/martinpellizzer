<p>Soehrensia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
