<p>Saxifraga paniculata var. canaliculata, commonly known as the rockfoam or canaliculate saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.

It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, arid conditions and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
