                    <h1>Stipa rupestris</h1>
<p>Stipa rupestris, commonly known as the rockgrass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and low precipitation. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Stipa rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest.</p>
