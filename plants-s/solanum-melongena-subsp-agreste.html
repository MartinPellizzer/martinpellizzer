<p>Solanum melongena subsp.</p>
<p>agreste, commonly known as the wild eggplant, is a lesser-known subspecies of the eggplant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smaller, often more elongated fruits compared to the common eggplant, with a tougher skin and a more bitter taste.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. It produces purple or white flowers and has a strong scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Solanaceae family, including tomatoes and peppers, and is valued for its potential in wild plant research and breeding programs.</p>
