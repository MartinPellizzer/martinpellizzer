                    <h1>Seddera spinosa</h1>
<p>Seddera spinosa, commonly known as the spiny seddera, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Seddera spinosa is often used in traditional medicine and landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental spines.</p>
