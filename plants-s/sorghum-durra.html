                    <h1>Sorghum durra</h1>
<p>Sorghum durra, commonly known as durra, is a tall, annual grass native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce edible grains. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Durra is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used to make flour, porridge, and beverages like sorghum beer.</p>
