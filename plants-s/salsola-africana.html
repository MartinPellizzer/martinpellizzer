<p>Salsola africana, commonly known as desert spinach, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine for their mild, spinach-like flavor.</p>
