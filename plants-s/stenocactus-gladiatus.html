<p>It is a small, solitary cactus with a distinctive, spiny, sword-like stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring and lasting for several weeks.</p>
<p>Stenocactus gladiatus is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
