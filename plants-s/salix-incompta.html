<p>Salix incompta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Europe and Asia, typically growing in moist, temperate environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix incompta is thin and fibrous, and it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
