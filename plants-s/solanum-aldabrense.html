<p>Solanum aldabrense, commonly known as the Aldabra nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
