                    <h1>Saurauia pauciflora var. ghiesbreghtii</h1>
<p>Saurauia pauciflora var. ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's saurauia, is a rare variant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
