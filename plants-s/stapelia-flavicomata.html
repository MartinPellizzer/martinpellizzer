                    <h1>Stapelia flavicomata</h1>
<p>Stapelia flavicomata, commonly known as the yellow star cactus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia flavicomata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
