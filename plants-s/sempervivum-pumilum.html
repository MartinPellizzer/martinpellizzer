<p>Sempervivum pumilum, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Sempervivum pumilum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold winters and poor soil.</p>
