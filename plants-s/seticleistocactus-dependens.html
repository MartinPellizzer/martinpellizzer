<p>Seticleistocactus dependens, commonly known as the hanging cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous stems that dangle from its base, creating a striking visual effect. The plant features small, spiny areoles with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens or xeriscapes.</p>
