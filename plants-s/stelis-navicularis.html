<p>Stelis navicularis, commonly known as the boat orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, often twisted stem with small, boat-shaped leaves that are usually green and glossy. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Stelis navicularis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose substrate for optimal growth.</p>
