<p>Schoenus aureus, commonly known as golden bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that are often golden-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Schoenus aureus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize shorelines in aquatic habitats.</p>
