                    <h1>Sisymbrium macrostachyum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium macrostachyum, commonly known as the large-stalked broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in elongated clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
