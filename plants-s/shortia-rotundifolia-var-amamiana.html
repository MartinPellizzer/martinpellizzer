                    <h1>Shortia rotundifolia var. amamiana</h1>
<p>Shortia rotundifolia var. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami shortia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Amami Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with distinctive, rounded, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its short, creeping stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels at the base of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, often in rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
