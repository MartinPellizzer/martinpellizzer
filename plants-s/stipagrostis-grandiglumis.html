                    <h1>Stipagrostis grandiglumis</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis grandiglumis, commonly known as the broad-leaved wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis grandiglumis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
