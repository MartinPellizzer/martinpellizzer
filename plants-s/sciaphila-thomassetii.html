                    <h1>Sciaphila thomassetii</h1>
<p>Sciaphila thomassetii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. Sciaphila thomassetii requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
