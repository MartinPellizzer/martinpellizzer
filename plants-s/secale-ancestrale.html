                    <h1>Secale ancestrale</h1>
<p>Secale ancestrale, commonly known as ancestral rye, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its historical significance in the domestication of rye, it holds interest for both botanical and agricultural research.</p>
