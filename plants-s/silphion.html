                    <h1>Silphion</h1>
<p>Silphion, commonly known as silphium, is an extinct plant that was highly valued in ancient times for its medicinal and culinary properties.</p>
<p>It was native to the region of Cyrenaica in North Africa and was characterized by its tall, erect growth and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant's roots contained a resinous substance that was used as an aphrodisiac, contraceptive, and treatment for various ailments. Due to overharvesting and environmental factors, silphion became extinct by the 5th century CE.</p>
<p>Its legacy remains as a symbol of ancient botanical knowledge and medicinal use.</p>
