                    <h1>Sphaerophysa pycnorrhiza</h1>
<p>Sphaerophysa pycnorrhiza, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, white or yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces round, inflated pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Sphaerophysa pycnorrhiza is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go through periods of dormancy during drought.</p>
