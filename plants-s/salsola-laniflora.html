                    <h1>Salsola laniflora</h1>
<p>Salsola laniflora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming low, mat-like structures that are well adapted to sandy soils. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Salsola laniflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
