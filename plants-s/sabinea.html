                    <h1>Sabinea</h1>
<p>Sabinea, commonly known as rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their low-growing, evergreen shrubs with dense, needle-like leaves. Sabinea species produce clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in spring. They are adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, they are popular in rock gardens and as ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
