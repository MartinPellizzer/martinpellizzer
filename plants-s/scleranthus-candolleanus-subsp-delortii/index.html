                            <h1>Scleranthus Candolleanus Subsp. Delortii</h1>
<p>Common evening primrose, scientifically known as Scleranthus candolleanus subsp. delortii, is a resilient flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. This species thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, fields, and rocky outcrops. Its distinctive yellow flowers bloom in the late afternoon, giving it its common name and making it a striking addition to the local flora. The plant is known for its adaptability to harsh environments and its ability to withstand drought conditions. Despite its common presence, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and unique characteristics.</p>
