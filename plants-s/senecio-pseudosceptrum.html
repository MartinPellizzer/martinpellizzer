<p>Senecio pseudosceptrum, commonly known as the false crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
