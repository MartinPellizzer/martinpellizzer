<p>Sapindus deficiens, commonly known as the Mexican soapberry, is a small deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Its fruit is notable for its ability to be used as a natural soap due to the presence of saponins, which have cleansing properties.</p>
