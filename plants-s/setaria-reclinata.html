<p>Setaria reclinata, commonly known as the prostrate dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Setaria reclinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil.</p>
