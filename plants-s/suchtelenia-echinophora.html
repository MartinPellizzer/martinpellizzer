                <h1>Suchtelenia echinophora</h1>
<p>Suchtelenia echinophora, commonly known as the spiny-flowered orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and intricate morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but striking, featuring a complex arrangement of sepals and petals with a distinctive spiny appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Suchtelenia echinophora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
