                    <h1>Sarracenia × wilksiana</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × wilksiana, commonly known as the Wilks' pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps. These traps secrete a sticky liquid that lures and digests insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients. The plant prefers acidic, boggy soils and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its striking red and green coloration makes it a popular choice for both botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
