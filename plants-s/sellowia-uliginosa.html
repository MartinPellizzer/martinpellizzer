                    <h1>Sellowia uliginosa</h1>
<p>Sellowia uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in moist, often acidic habitats.</p>
<p>Sellowia uliginosa is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
