<p>Sinarundinaria maling, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a member of the fern family, Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, dichotomous fronds that are often bright green and covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Sinarundinaria maling is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
