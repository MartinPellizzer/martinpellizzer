                            <h1>Sarothamnus Striatus</h1>
<p>Sarothamnus striatus, commonly known as the striped thyme shrub, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and dry landscapes. This plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes. Despite its resilience, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish.</p>
