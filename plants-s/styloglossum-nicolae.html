<p>Styloglossum nicolae, commonly known as the Nicolae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale lavender flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
