<p>Saxifraga montanensis var. typica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features dense, rosette-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, adding a delicate appearance to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga montanensis var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
