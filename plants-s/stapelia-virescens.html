<p>Stapelia virescens, commonly known as the green stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, meaty flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia virescens is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
