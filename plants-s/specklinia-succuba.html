                    <h1>Specklinia succuba</h1>
<p>Specklinia succuba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Specklinia succuba is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
