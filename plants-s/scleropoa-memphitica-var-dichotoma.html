<p>Scleropoa memphitica var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
