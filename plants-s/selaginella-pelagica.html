                    <h1>Selaginella pelagica</h1>
<p>Selaginella pelagica, commonly known as the sea sprout, is a unique vascular plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is notable for its ability to survive in high-salinity conditions. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, reducing water loss in harsh maritime climates. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Selaginella pelagica is often found on rocky shores and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
