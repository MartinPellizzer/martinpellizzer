                    <h1>Salsola tomentosa</h1>
<p>Salsola tomentosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has spiny leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Its small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Salsola tomentosa is an invasive species in many regions, spreading rapidly and forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
