                    <h1>Schefflera yutajensis</h1>
<p>Schefflera yutajensis, commonly known as the Yutajensis umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
