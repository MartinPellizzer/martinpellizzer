<p>Spergula pentandra var. granulata, commonly known as granulate false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The variety granulata is characterized by its finely granular texture on the leaf surface, which sets it apart from other varieties of Spergula pentandra.</p>
