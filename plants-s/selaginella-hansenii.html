<p>Selaginella hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant has a distinctive appearance with whorls of needle-like leaves and a creeping or upright growth habit. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and tolerate drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
