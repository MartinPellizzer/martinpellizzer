<p>Simocheilus patulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a thick, fleshy stem that helps it anchor in soft sediments. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, usually appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
