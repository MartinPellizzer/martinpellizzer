                    <h1>Schoenocaulon dubium</h1>
<p>Schoenocaulon dubium, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows from a short, tuberous rootstock and produces basal rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves. The plant's small yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Schoenocaulon dubium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
