                    <h1>Striga somaliensis</h1>
<p>Striga somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of cereal crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is known for its ability to cause significant agricultural losses. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food security, it is considered a major weed in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
