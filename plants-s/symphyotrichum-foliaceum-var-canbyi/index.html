<p>Symphyotrichum foliaceum var. canbyi is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern united states. it belongs to the aster family and is known for its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. this variant of symphyotrichum foliaceum is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and creek banks. due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
