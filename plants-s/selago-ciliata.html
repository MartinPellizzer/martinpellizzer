                    <h1>Selago ciliata</h1>
<p>Selago ciliata, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Selago ciliata is well-suited to saline and wind-swept conditions, making it an important part of coastal ecosystems.</p>
