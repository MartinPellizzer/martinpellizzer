<p>Seriphium capitatum, commonly known as the Great Basin gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Seriphium capitatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid conditions.</p>
