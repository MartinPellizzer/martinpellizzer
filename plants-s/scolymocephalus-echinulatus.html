                    <h1>Scolymocephalus echinulatus</h1>
<p>Scolymocephalus echinulatus, commonly known as the spiny-headed water plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its dense, spiny inflorescence.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant's leaves are small and often submerged, while its flowers are borne in compact, cone-like clusters at the water's surface. Its spiny bracts are adapted to protect the reproductive structures from herbivores and water currents.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
