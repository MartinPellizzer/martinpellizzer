<p>Salix huntingdonia, commonly known as the Huntington willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, riparian habitats. The plant has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of willow species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Salix huntingdonia is highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
