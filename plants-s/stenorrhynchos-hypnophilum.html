                    <h1>Stenorrhynchos hypnophilum</h1>
<p>Stenorrhynchos hypnophilum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
