The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically revolute, meaning they curl under at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
