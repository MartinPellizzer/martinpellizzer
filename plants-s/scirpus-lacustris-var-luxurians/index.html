It is commonly found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes where water is shallow and abundant. This variant of Scirpus lacustris is distinguished by its lush, bushy growth pattern that provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a resilient species in dynamic ecosystems. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and improving water quality in wetland habitats.</p>
