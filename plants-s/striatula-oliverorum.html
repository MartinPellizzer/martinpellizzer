<p>Striatula oliverorum, commonly known as the Oliver's stripeless bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and shallow waters of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. The plant is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called bladders, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Striatula oliverorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
