                    <h1>Salix arguta var. alpigena</h1>
<p>Salix arguta var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
