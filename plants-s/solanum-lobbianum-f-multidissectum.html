                    <h1>Solanum lobbianum f. multidissectum</h1>
<p>Solanum lobbianum f. multidissectum, commonly known as the multidissected nightshade, is a botanical variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its highly dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that typically transition into berries, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
