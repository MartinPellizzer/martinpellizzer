<p>Silene sedoides, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Silene sedoides is often found in open meadows and mountain tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
