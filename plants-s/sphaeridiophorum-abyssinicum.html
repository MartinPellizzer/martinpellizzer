                    <h1>Sphaeridiophorum abyssinicum</h1>
<p>Sphaeridiophorum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian star moss, is a unique and rare species of liverwort found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, rounded leaves that are tightly clustered. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or among mosses in mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leafy mats, making it challenging to identify without careful examination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
