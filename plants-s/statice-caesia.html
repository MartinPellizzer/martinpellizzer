<p>Statice caesia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal plains. Its feathery foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements.</p>
<p>Statice caesia is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
