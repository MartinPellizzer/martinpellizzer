                    <h1>Sophia andrenarum var. osmiarum</h1>
<p>Sophia andrenarum var. osmiarum, commonly known as the honeybee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
