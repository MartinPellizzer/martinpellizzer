<p>Suaeda lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fleshy stems and leaves store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Suaeda lehmannii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
