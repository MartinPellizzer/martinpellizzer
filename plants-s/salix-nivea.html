                    <h1>Salix nivea</h1>
<p>Salix nivea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. Its bark is thin and grayish-white, and it is often found in moist, sandy soils near rivers or lakes.</p>
<p>Salix nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to willow bark.</p>
