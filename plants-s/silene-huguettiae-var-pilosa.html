                    <h1>Silene huguettiae var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Silene huguettiae var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy Silene, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The variety 'pilosa' is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. It typically blooms in late summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
