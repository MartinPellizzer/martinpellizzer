                    <h1>Salix × vorobievii</h1>
<p>Salix × vorobievii, commonly known as the Vorobievii willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in certain regions has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
