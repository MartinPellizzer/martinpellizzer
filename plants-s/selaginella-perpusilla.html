                    <h1>Selaginella perpusilla</h1>
<p>Selaginella perpusilla, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Selaginella perpusilla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
