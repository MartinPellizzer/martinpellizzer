<p>Salix × simulatrix, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a bluish-green hue when young, turning dark green in maturity. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
