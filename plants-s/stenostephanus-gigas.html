                    <h1>Stenostephanus gigas</h1>
<p>Stenostephanus gigas, commonly known as the giant stephanos, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenostephanus gigas is considered a conservation concern.</p>
