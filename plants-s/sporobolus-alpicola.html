<p>Sporobolus alpicola, commonly known as alpine needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
