<p>Sphaeralcea crispa, commonly known as the crinkled globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a crinkled appearance, and the stems are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea crispa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
