                    <h1>Stetsonia coryne</h1>
<p>Stetsonia coryne, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Stetsonia coryne is a perennial species that goes dormant during periods of drought, resuming growth with the arrival of rainfall.</p>
