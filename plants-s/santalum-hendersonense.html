                    <h1>Santalum hendersonense</h1>
<p>Santalum hendersonense, commonly known as the Henderson sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Henderson in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by woody, aromatic fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its fragrance and has been heavily harvested, leading to its near extinction.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
