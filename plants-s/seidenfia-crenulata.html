                    <h1>Seidenfia crenulata</h1>
<p>Seidenfia crenulata, commonly known as the crested sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Seidenfia crenulata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
