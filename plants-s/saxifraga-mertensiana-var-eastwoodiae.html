The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and desiccation. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the short growing season.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, making it a characteristic species of tundra and mountain habitats.</p>
