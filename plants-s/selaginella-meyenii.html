<p>Selaginella meyenii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a type of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a drought-tolerant species that can survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of dormancy. When rehydrated, it can "resurrect" by rapidly regaining its turgor and green appearance. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit and produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures.</p>
<p>It is native to arid regions of Central and South America and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
