                    <h1>Stipa duriuscula</h1>
<p>Stipa duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Stipa duriuscula plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
