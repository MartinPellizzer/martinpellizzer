                    <h1>Scilla drunensis lusus albescens</h1>
<p>Scilla drunensis lusus albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered scilla, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
