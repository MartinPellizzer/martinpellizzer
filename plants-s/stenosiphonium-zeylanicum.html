<p>Stenosiphonium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fragrant, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
