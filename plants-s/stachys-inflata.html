<p>Stachys inflata, commonly known as the inflated hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like stems that store water, a feature that helps it survive in dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its small, pink or purple flowers appear in whorled clusters along the stems, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Stachys inflata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
