<p>Sporobolus virginicus subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as coastal sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important stabilizer of coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread via rhizomes helps it form dense vegetation that protects against erosion.</p>
