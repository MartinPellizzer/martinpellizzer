                    <h1>Stapelia desmetiana</h1>
<p>Stapelia desmetiana, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, meaty, and often wrinkled stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, allowing the plant to store water efficiently.</p>
