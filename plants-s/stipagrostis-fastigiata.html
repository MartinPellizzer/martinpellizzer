<p>Stipagrostis fastigiata, commonly known as the rigid grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright blades and dense growth habit, which make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes, where it thrives in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis fastigiata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
