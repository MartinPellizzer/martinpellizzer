<p>Senefeldera multiflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senefeldera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
