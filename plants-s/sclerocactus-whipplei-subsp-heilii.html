<p>Sclerocactus whipplei subsp.</p>
<p>heilii, commonly known as the Heil's hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
