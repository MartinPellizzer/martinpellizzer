<p>Saxifraga ciliolata, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Saxifraga ciliolata is adapted to cold climates and has a unique ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
