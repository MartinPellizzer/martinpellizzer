                    <h1>Sophia perplexa</h1>
<p>Sophia perplexa, commonly known as the enigmatic twilight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the twilight hours, adding to its mystique and making it a subject of fascination for botanists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sophia perplexa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
