                    <h1>Synnema diffusum</h1>
<p>Synnema diffusum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, silky coating, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Synnema diffusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a terrarium plant.</p>
