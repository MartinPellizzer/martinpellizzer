                    <h1>Stelis trichostoma</h1>
<p>Stelis trichostoma, commonly known as the hairy stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
