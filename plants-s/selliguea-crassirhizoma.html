<p>Selliguea crassirhizoma, commonly known as the thick-rooted moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures and a well-developed rhizoids system that anchors it to substrates.
