<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
