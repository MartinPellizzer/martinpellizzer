                            <h1>Sorghum Parviflorum</h1>
<p>Parviflorum sorghum, scientifically known as Sorghum parviflorum, is a unique and lesser-known species within the grass family. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit. It has gained attention for its potential in sustainable agriculture and as a source of nutrition. Due to its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, it is being explored as a crop for arid environments. Despite its promising traits, Parviflorum sorghum remains under-researched and underutilized in global farming systems.</p>
