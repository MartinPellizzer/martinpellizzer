                    <h1>Selaginella demissa</h1>
<p>Selaginella demissa, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions through its ability to retain moisture in its tissues.</p>
<p>Selaginella demissa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
