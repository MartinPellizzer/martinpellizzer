<p>Blue-eyed grass, scientifically known as Sesleria caerulea subsp. insularis, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its clusters of blue flowers that resemble eyes, giving it its common name. This low-growing perennial thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance makes it a favorite among gardeners seeking to add a touch of elegance to their landscapes. Despite its small size, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
