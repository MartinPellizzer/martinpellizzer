                    <h1>Salix longiflora</h1>
<p>Salix longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Salix longiflora is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
