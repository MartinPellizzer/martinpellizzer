                    <h1>Scolymocephalus neriifolius</h1>
<p>Scolymocephalus neriifolius, commonly known as the blackleaf scolymus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, almost black leaves that are densely veined and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
