<p>Serrafalcus scoparius, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while also storing nutrients.</p>
<p>Serrafalcus scoparius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
