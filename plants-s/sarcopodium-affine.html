                    <h1>Sarcopodium affine</h1>
<p>Sarcopodium affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding ornamental value to ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize water bodies effectively.</p>
<p>Sarcopodium affine is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
