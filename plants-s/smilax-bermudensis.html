                    <h1>Smilax bermudensis</h1>
<p>Smilax bermudensis, commonly known as Bermuda arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
