                    <h1>Saxifraga aurea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga aurea, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aurea is often found in mountain meadows and is a symbol of resilience in extreme environments.</p>
