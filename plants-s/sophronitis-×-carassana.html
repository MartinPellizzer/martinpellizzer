<p>Sophronitis × carassana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sophronitis ciliata and Dendrobium bigibbum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful flowers with a distinctive lip that is typically more elaborate than in its parent species. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and adaptability.</p>
