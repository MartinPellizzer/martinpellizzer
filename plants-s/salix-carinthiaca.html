                    <h1>Salix carinthiaca</h1>
<p>Salix carinthiaca, commonly known as the Carpathian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
