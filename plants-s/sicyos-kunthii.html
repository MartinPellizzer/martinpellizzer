<p>Sicyos kunthii, commonly known as the giant stick-tight fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sicyos kunthii is notable for its ability to produce a sticky substance that can trap small insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
