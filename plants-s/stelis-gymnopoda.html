<p>Stelis gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stem stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a short, unbranched stem and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in shaded, humid forest habitats.</p>
