                    <h1>Striga zangebarica</h1>
<p>Striga zangebarica, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination triggered by root exudates from host plants. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting cereal crops like maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>Its ability to persist in soil as dormant seeds makes it a challenging weed to manage.</p>
