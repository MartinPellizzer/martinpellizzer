                    <h1>Selaginella venulosa</h1>
<p>Selaginella venulosa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense, mat-like clusters on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Selaginella venulosa is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to survive in dry, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to retain moisture and its unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
