<p>Senecio chachaniensis, commonly known as the Chachani groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, contributing to the plant's ecological role in pollination and soil stabilization.</p>
