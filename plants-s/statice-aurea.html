                    <h1>Statice aurea</h1>
<p>Statice aurea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Statice aurea is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms.</p>
