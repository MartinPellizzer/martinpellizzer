                    <h1>Salix aurita var. cinerea</h1>
<p>Salix aurita var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-barked stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
