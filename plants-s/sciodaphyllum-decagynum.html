                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum decagynum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum decagynum, commonly known as the sunless-fruit tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, spirally arranged leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are predominantly white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Sciodaphyllum decagynum is considered a conservation priority.</p>
