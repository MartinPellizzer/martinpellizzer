                    <h1>Sabulina juniperina var. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Sabulina juniperina var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular juniper saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its glandular structures on the leaves and stems help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
