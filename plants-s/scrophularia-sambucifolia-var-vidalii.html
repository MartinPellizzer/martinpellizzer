<p>Scrophularia sambucifolia var. vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's horse gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
