<p>Salix constricta, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is dark, fissured, and peels in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>Salix constricta is often found along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
