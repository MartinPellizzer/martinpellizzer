<p>Stipagrostis namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy soils and is well-suited to the harsh, arid environments of the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis namibensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
