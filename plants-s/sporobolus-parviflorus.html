                    <h1>Sporobolus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flower dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its natural spread across arid environments.</p>
<p>Sporobolus parviflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
