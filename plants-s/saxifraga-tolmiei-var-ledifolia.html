<p>Saxifraga tolmiei var. ledifolia, commonly known as the Kashmir saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and shady borders.</p>
