<p>Silene pyrenaica subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoviscosa, commonly known as the Pyrenean catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly sticky leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant.</p>
