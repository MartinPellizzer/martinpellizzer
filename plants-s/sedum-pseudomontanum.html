<p>Sedum pseudomontanum, commonly known as the mountain sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
