                    <h1>Sponia discolor</h1>
<p>Sponia discolor, commonly known as the variable spongeplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Sponia discolor is known for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
