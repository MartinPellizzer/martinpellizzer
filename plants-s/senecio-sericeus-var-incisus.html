                    <h1>Senecio sericeus var. incisus</h1>
<p>Senecio sericeus var. incisus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
