                    <h1>Scolopia calcicola</h1>
<p>Scolopia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone scolopia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate, which is why it is often found in limestone areas. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Scolopia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments.</p>
