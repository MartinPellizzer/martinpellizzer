<p>Sedum rubens subsp.</p>
<p>cespitosum, commonly known as the red stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a mat-like growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care.</p>
