                    <h1>Senegalia brevispica</h1>
<p>Senegalia brevispica, commonly known as the short-spined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, linear pods containing seeds. Senegalia brevispica is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
