<p>Seriphidium ramosum, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and a low profile to reduce water loss. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Seriphidium ramosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert organisms.</p>
