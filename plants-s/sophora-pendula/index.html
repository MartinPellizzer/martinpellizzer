<p>Sophora pendula, also known as the weeping silk tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to China. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that drape like curtains, creating a unique and dramatic visual effect. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are often followed by decorative seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its graceful appearance and hardy nature make it a favorite among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts alike.</p>
