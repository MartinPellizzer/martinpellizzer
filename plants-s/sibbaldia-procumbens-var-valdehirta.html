                    <h1>Sibbaldia procumbens var. valdehirta</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia procumbens var. valdehirta, commonly known as the creeping sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Papaveraceae family and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
