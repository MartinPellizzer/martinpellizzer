                    <h1>Stipa aphylla</h1>
<p>Stipa aphylla, commonly known as the naked false oat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and reduced leaf blades, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa aphylla thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
