                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. minor</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow wetlands, ponds, and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
