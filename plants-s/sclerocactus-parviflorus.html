                    <h1>Sclerocactus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered rock cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate beauty to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Sclerocactus parviflorus is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
