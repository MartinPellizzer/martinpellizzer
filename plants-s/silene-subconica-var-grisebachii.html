<p>Silene subconica var. grisebachii, commonly known as the grayleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
