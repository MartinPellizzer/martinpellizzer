                    <h1>Squilla littoralis</h1>
<p>Squilla littoralis, commonly known as the European shore crab, is a marine crustacean found in coastal areas of the Atlantic and Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of rocky shore ecosystems. The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton is due to its calcified outer layer, which provides protection against predators and environmental stress. It feeds on algae, detritus, and small invertebrates, contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true plant but a member of the crustacean class Malacostraca.</p>
