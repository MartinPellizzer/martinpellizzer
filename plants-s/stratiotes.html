                    <h1>Stratiotes</h1>
<p>Stratiotes, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant found in slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on stalks above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that can stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Stratiotes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality.</p>
