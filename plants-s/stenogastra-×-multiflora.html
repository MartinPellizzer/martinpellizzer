<p>Stenogastra × multiflora, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate pruning.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
