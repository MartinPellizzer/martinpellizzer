<p>Schizonotus argenteus var. intermedius, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves contain latex, which can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
