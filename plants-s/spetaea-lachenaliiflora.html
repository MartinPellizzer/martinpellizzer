                    <h1>Spetaea lachenaliiflora</h1>
<p>Spetaea lachenaliiflora, commonly known as the Lachenal's spetaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale blue, arranged in a compact inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spetaea lachenaliiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
