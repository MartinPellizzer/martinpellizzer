<p>Stelis nitens, commonly known as the bright-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features striking white or pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically small and white, with a delicate fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Stelis nitens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
