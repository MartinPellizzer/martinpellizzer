                    <h1>Salix sibirica var. subopposita</h1>
<p>Salix sibirica var. subopposita, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
