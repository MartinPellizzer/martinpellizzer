<p>Solenangis cornuta, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure with a prominent, horn-like projection on the lip, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and purple hues, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Solenangis cornuta is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
