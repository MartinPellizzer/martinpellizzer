                    <h1>Selaginella pitcheriana</h1>
<p>Selaginella pitcheriana, commonly known as the Pitcher's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiky leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. This plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing structures. Selaginella pitcheriana is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, a feature common to many mosses and ferns.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat destruction and limited geographic distribution.</p>
