<p>Sisymbrium austriacum subsp.</p>
<p>contortum, commonly known as the twisted broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it blooms from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
