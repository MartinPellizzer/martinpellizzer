<p>Samolus valerandi var. typicus, commonly known as the lesser water-plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Samolus valerandi var. typicus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
