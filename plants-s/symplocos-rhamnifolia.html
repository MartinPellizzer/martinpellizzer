                    <h1>Symplocos rhamnifolia</h1>
<p>Symplocos rhamnifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf sandpaper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch due to their dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Symplocos rhamnifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
