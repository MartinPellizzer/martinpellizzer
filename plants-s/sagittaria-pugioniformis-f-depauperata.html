                    <h1>Sagittaria pugioniformis f. depauperata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria pugioniformis f. depauperata, commonly known as the spiny arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its reduced foliage and distinctive, spiny leaves.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Alismataceae family and is native to wetland environments in North America. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often have a rough, textured surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>This form is less lush than the typical Sagittaria pugioniformis, making it a unique and striking addition to aquatic gardens.</p>
