<p>Serapias × triloba, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a fascinating plant that combines traits from its parent species, Serapias grandiflora and Serapias microchila.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich blossoms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base, while its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Serapias × triloba is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
