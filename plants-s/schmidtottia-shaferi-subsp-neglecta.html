<p>Schmidtottia shaferi subsp.</p>
<p>neglecta, commonly known as the Schomburgk's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Sclerocarya*, through haustoria that extract water and nutrients. It is typically found in dry, savanna-like environments, thriving in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
