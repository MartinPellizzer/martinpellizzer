<p>Salix phylicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>hegetschweileri, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, which contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
