<p>Spinifex × alterniflorus, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Spinifex strictus and Spinifex sericeus.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in arid and coastal environments, often found in sand dunes and saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowering stems are usually erect and bear small, pale green or brown flowers that are adapted to wind pollination.</p>
<p>Spinifex × alterniflorus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
