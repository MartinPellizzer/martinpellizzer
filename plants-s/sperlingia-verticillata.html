<p>Sperlingia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>Sperlingia verticillata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
