<p>Silene brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arctic environment.</p>
<p>Silene brachypoda plays a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies.</p>
