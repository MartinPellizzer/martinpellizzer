                    <h1>Spicanta occidentalis</h1>
<p>Spicanta occidentalis, commonly known as the Western spiky weed, is a perennial plant native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Spicanta occidentalis is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
