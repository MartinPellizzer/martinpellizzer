<p>Saussurea polylepis, commonly known as the royal foamflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Saussurea polylepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
