<p>Stapelia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Stapeliad, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its ability to store water, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia hirsuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
