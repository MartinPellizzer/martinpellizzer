                    <h1>Salix frigens</h1>
<p>Salix frigens, commonly known as the frost willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring before the leaves emerge. Salix frigens is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in extreme conditions with minimal resources.</p>
