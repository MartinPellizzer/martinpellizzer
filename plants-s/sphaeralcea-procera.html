<p>Sphaeralcea procera, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea procera is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
