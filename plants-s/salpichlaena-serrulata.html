<p>Salpichlaena serrulata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Salpichlaena serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor gardens.</p>
