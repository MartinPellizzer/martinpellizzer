<p>Stipa litoralis, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand salty air and strong winds.</p>
<p>Stipa litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
