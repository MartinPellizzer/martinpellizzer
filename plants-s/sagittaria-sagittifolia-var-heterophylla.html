                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic species characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its habitat. Its leaves vary in shape depending on the water depth, with submerged leaves being more elongated and floating leaves broader.</p>
<p>This variation in leaf morphology helps the plant adapt to different aquatic environments.</p>
