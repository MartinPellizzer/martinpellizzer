<p>Sanguisorba officinalis var. typica, commonly known as the common sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, reddish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
