<p>Stapelia fasciculata, commonly known as the star-shaped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom during the summer months and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia fasciculata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance.</p>
