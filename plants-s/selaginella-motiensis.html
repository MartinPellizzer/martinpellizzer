                    <h1>Selaginella motiensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella motiensis, commonly known as the Motien's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
