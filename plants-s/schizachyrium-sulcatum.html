<p>Schizachyrium sulcatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass that thrives in prairie and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature to a rusty brown color, typically in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Little bluestem is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
