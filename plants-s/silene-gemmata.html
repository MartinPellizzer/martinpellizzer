<p>Silene gemmata, commonly known as the gemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and heaths. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environments.</p>
<p>Silene gemmata is also notable for its unique reproductive structures, including the presence of gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules.</p>
