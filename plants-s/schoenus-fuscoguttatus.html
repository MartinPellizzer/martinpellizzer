                    <h1>Schoenus fuscoguttatus</h1>
<p>Schoenus fuscoguttatus, commonly known as the brown-spotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its distinctive brown spots on the leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
