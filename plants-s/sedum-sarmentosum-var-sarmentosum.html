<p>[WRONG START] Sedum sarmentosos var. sarmentosum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
