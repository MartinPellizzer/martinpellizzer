                    <h1>Stellularia media var. aquatica</h1>
<p>Stellularia media var. aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving water bodies in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the water's surface. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating or partially submerged, contributing to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Stellularia media var. aquatica plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
