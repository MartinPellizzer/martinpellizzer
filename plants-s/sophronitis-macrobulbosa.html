<p>Sophronitis macrobulbosa, commonly known as the giant bulb orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. The plant produces tall, erect stems with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its unique morphology and blooming habits make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
