                    <h1>Salix lapponum var. jacquinii</h1>
<p>Salix lapponum var. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its role in early season pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
