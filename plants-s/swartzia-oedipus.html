<p>Swartzia oedipus, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds.
