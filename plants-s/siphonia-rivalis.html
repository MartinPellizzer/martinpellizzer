<p>Siphonia rivalis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that help the plant breathe in waterlogged soil. The plant thrives in saline environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in high-salinity conditions.</p>
<p>Siphonia rivalis is also known for its ability to filter pollutants from the water, making it an important species in mangrove forests.</p>
