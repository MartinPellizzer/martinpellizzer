<p>Senecio lautus subsp.</p>
<p>alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>

<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant.</p>
