                <h1>Sorghum fauriei</h1>
<p>Sorghum fauriei, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. The plant produces panicles of small, white to purplish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Sorghum fauriei is often used as a forage crop for livestock due to its high biomass yield and nutritional value.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in degraded landscapes.</p>
