                    <h1>Saxifraga valleculosa var. callosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga valleculosa var. callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early summer, usually in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>The variety callosa is characterized by its rough, textured leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude habitat.</p>
