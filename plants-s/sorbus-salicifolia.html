                    <h1>Sorbus salicifolia</h1>
<p>Sorbus salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, willow-like leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to orange-red berries in the fall. Its bark is often fissured and becomes smoother with age, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Sorbus salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
