                    <h1>Solanum anomalocalyx var. llallaguanianum</h1>
<p>Solanum anomalocalyx var. llallaguanianum, commonly known as the Llallagua nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep purple, though they are not typically consumed by humans due to their potential toxicity.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
