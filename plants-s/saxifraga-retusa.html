<p>Saxifraga retusa, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or tundra environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, smooth, and waxy leaves that help retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and borne on slender stems, often appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga retusa is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
