<p>Saxifraga sarmentosa var. immaculata, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
