<p>Saxifraga qinghaiensis, commonly known as the Qinghai saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Qinghai Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
