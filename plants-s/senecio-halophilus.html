<p>Senecio halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush or salt plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
