                    <h1>Scrophularia crithmifolia</h1>
<p>Scrophularia crithmifolia, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or cliffs. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Scrophularia crithmifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting pollinators.</p>
