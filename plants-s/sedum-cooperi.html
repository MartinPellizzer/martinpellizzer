                    <h1>Sedum cooperi</h1>
<p>Sedum cooperi, commonly known as the Blue Spruce Sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, Sedum cooperi is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9.</p>
