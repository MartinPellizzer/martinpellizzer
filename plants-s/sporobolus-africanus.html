<p>Sporobolus africanus, commonly known as African sand grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus africanus is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
