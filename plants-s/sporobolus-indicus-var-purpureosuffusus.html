                    <h1>Sporobolus indicus var. purpureosuffusus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus indicus var. purpureosuffusus, commonly known as purple-stemmed sandspur, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged stems, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
