<p>Salix rigida var. vestita, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and silvery-white undersides of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds.</p>
