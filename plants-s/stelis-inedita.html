                    <h1>Stelis inedita</h1>
<p>Stelis inedita, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a fascinating example of adaptation to its humid, shaded environment. It thrives in high humidity and requires specific conditions to flourish, often growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stelis inedita is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
