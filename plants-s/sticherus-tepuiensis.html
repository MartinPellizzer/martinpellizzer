                    <h1>Sticherus tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Sticherus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui sticherus, is a rare and unique moss species native to the high-altitude regions of the tepuis in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and specialized adaptations to the harsh, ultraviolet-rich environments of these mountainous habitats. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with tightly interwoven stems and leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting microhabitats on the isolated tepuis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
