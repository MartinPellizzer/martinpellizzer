<p>Stipa lagascae var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which help it survive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, pubescent hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
