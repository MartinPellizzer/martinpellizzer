<p>Selaginella firmuloides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its closely spaced, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Selaginella firmuloides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
