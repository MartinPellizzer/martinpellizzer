                    <h1>Saxifraga diversifolia var. parnassifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga diversifolia var. parnassifolia, commonly known as the Parnassian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
