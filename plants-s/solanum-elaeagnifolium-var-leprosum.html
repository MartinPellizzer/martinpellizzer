                    <h1>Solanum elaeagnifolium var. leprosum</h1>
<p>Solanum elaeagnifolium var. leprosum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are generally toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
