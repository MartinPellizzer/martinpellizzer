                    <h1>Saxifraga bulbosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
