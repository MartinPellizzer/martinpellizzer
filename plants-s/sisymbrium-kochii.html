                    <h1>Sisymbrium kochii</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium kochii, commonly known as the Koch's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem structure. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
