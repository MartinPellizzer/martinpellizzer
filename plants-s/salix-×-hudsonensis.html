<p>Salix × hudsonensis, commonly known as the Hudson's Bay willow, is a hybrid species native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often waterlogged soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, often zigzagging branches and small, triangular leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to wet environments, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
