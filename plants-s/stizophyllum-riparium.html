                    <h1>Stizophyllum riparium</h1>
<p>Stizophyllum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank stizophyllum, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along water edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Stizophyllum riparium plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
