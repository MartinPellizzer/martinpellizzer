                    <h1>Scirpus × intermedius</h1>
<p>Scirpus × intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate bulrush, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Scirpus mariqueter and Scirpus americanus.</p>
<p>It is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, cylindrical spikes that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus × intermedius plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
