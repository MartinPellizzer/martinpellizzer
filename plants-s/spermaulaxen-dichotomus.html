<p>Spermaulaxen dichotomus, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, flat, and often branched thallus that grows close to the ground in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple structure composed of a single layer of cells. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in small, cup-like structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Spermaulaxen dichotomus is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in humid and cool climates.</p>
