<p>Snowball bush, scientifically known as Spiraea tomentulosa, is a deciduous shrub prized for its showy floral displays. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its most striking feature is the dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care. With its graceful form and seasonal beauty, it adds charm to landscapes throughout the growing season.</p>
