<p>Setaria rara, commonly known as the rare beardgrass, is a diminutive annual grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low population numbers, Setaria rara is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
