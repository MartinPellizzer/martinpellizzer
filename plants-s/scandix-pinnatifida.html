<p>Scandix pinnatifida, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, hollow stem with purple spots and large, pinnately lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
