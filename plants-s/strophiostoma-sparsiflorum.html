                    <h1>Strophiostoma sparsiflorum</h1>
<p>Strophiostoma sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered starwort, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, enhancing its ability to retain moisture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in loose, umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
