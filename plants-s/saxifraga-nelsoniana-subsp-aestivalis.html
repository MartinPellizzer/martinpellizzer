<p>Saxifraga nelsoniana subsp.</p>
<p>aestivalis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
