<p>Syngonanthus umbellatus var. prancei, commonly known as the Prance's umbellate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Inga*, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
