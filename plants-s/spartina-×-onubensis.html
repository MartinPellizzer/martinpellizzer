                    <h1>Spartina × onubensis</h1>
<p>Spartina × onubensis, commonly known as the hybrid cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Spartina alterniflora and Spartina maritima, two species that have adapted to saltwater environments. The plant has tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. Spartina × onubensis thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
