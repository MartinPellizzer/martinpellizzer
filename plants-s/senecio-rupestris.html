<p>Senecio rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>
