<p>Sporobolus schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus schaffneri is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
