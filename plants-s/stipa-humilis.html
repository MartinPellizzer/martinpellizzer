                    <h1>Stipa humilis</h1>
<p>Stipa humilis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, needle-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Stipa humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
