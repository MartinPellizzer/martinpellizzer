                    <h1>Stapelia hirsuta var. affinis</h1>
<p>Stapelia hirsuta var. affinis, commonly known as the hairy stapelia or the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking decaying flesh to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other stapelia species and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
