<p>Schoenoplectus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus ehrenbergii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species.</p>
