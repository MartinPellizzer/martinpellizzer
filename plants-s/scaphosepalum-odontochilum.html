<p>Scaphosepalum odontochilum, commonly known as the toothed lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated sepals and petals that often have a toothed or serrated edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a delicate, fragrant appearance.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and ecological requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
