<p>Senegalia purpusii, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled trunk and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Senegalia purpusii is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
