                    <h1>Sporobolus macer</h1>
<p>Sporobolus macer, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Sporobolus macer is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to disturbed sites.</p>
