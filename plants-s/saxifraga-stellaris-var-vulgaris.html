<p>Saxifraga stellaris var. vulgaris, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
