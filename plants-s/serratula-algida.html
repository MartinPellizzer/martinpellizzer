                    <h1>Serratula algida</h1>
<p>Serratula algida, commonly known as the alpine serrata, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are serrated and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Serratula algida produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
