                    <h1>Stapelia erivacaria</h1>
<p>Stapelia erivacaria, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a unique, branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive coral-like appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it blooms in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Stapelia erivacaria is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
