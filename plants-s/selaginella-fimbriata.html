                    <h1>Selaginella fimbriata</h1>
<p>Selaginella fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella fimbriata is often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in challenging habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
