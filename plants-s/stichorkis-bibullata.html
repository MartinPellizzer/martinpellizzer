<p>Stichorkis bibullata, commonly known as the red-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, succulent leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, showy red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>
<p>Stichorkis bibullata is often found in rocky outcrops and dry, well-drained habitats, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
