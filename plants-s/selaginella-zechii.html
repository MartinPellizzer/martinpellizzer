                    <h1>Selaginella zechii</h1>
<p>Selaginella zechii, commonly known as the Zech's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Selaginella zechii is considered a valuable species for botanical research.</p>
