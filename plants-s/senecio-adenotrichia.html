                    <h1>Senecio adenotrichia</h1>
<p>Senecio adenotrichia, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
