                    <h1>Senegalia dudgeonii</h1>
<p>Senegalia dudgeonii, commonly known as the yellow burr shrub, is a woody shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow, pod-like fruits that contain hard, spiny seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators.</p>
<p>Senegalia dudgeonii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
