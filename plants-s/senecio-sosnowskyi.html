<p>Senecio sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern and central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
