<p>Salix repens subsp.</p>
<p>rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the creeping willow with rosemary-like leaves, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fragrant, minty aroma reminiscent of rosemary. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
