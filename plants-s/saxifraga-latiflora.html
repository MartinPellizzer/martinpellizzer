                    <h1>Saxifraga latiflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga latiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga latiflora is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
