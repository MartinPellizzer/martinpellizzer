                    <h1>Sambucus plumosa ornata</h1>
<p>Sambucus plumosa ornata, commonly known as the ornate elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity when unripe.</p>
<p>Sambucus plumosa ornata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
