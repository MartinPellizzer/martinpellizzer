                    <h1>Stellilabium fernandezii</h1>
<p>Stellilabium fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's star-labium fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
