                    <h1>Schkuhria viscosissima</h1>
<p>Schkuhria viscosissima, commonly known as the sticky sandwort, is a member of the Montiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems are a key adaptation for reducing water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Schkuhria viscosissima is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
