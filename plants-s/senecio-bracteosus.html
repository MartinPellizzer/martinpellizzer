                    <h1>Senecio bracteosus</h1>
<p>Senecio bracteosus, commonly known as the ice plant or frost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Senecio bracteosus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
