<p>Salix mucronata subsp.</p>
<p>hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
