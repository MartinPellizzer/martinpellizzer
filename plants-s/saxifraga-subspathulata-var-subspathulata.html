<p>Saxifraga subspathulata var. subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range.</p>
