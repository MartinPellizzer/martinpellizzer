                    <h1>Sarcorhyna lessertiana</h1>
<p>Sarcorhyna lessertiana, commonly known as the Lesser's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Sarcorhyna lessertiana is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
