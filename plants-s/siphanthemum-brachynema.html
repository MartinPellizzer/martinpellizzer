                    <h1>Siphanthemum brachynema</h1>
<p>Siphanthemum brachynema, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-gray in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
