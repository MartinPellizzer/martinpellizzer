<p>Stahlianthus rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-margin stahlianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red margins on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
