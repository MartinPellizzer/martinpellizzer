                    <h1>Sclerocactus whipplei var. roseus</h1>
<p>Sclerocactus whipplei var. roseus, commonly known as the roseate whipple cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in short, white to pink spines, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. Its flowers, which are typically pale pink to red, bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
