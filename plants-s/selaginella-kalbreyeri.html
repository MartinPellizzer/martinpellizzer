<p>Selaginella kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome with upright, linear leaves that are often spirally arranged. Its sporophyte stage produces microsporangia and megasporangia, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
