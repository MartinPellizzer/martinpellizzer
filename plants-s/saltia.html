                    <h1>Saltia</h1>
<p>Saltia, commonly known as the saltbush, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers and their ability to accumulate salt in their tissues, which helps them survive in harsh conditions. Saltia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with dense, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. They are widely distributed across Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>The genus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
