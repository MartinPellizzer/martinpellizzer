                    <h1>Schizocodon ilicifolius var. ilicifolius</h1>
<p>Schizocodon ilicifolius var. ilicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, holly-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark, wrinkled berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties.</p>
