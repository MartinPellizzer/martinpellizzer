                    <h1>Stangea</h1>
<p>Stangea, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, often ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Stangea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>
