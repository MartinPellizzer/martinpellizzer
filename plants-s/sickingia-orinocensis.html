<p>Sickingia orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco ice plant, is a succulent species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
