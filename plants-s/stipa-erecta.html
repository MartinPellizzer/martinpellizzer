                    <h1>Stipa erecta</h1>
<p>Stipa erecta, commonly known as the upright feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps and spread gradually.</p>
<p>Stipa erecta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
