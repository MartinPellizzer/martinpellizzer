<p>Sparganium stoloniferum, commonly known as the fragrant bur reed, is a wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are followed by spiky, cone-like fruits. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage, which can be used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
