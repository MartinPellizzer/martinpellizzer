                    <h1>Salix rivulicola</h1>
<p>Salix rivulicola, commonly known as the stream willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, often riparian environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it an important species for stabilizing streambanks and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Salix rivulicola is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its use in traditional landscaping.</p>
