                    <h1>Solanum lycoctonum</h1>
<p>Solanum lycoctonum, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae).</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that produces dark purple berries which are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a rough texture and hairy surfaces. Its flowers are typically bell-shaped, with yellow stamens and a violet or purple corolla.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in medicine and witchcraft, though its potent toxicity makes it a dangerous plant to handle.</p>
