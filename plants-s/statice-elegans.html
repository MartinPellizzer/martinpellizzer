<p>Statice elegans, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically gray-green in color, and the plant is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>Statice elegans is also valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
