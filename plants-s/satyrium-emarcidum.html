<p>Satyrium emarcidum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
