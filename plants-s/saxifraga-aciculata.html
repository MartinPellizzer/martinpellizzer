<p>Saxifraga aciculata, commonly known as the needle-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Saxifraga aciculata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
