<p>Scirpus micranthus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
