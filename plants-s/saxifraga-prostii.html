<p>Saxifraga prostii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga prostii is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
