<p>Stelis carnalis, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its rhizome is short and produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
