<p>Striga hermonthica subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily in the grass family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, causing significant damage to crops like sorghum and millet.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short lifecycle, completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds are highly resilient, capable of remaining viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food security, efforts are ongoing to develop effective control methods.</p>
