<p>Scilla vindobonensis lusus alba, commonly known as the white Vienna squill, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded bulbs and is often found in moist, rocky soils. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other scilla species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
