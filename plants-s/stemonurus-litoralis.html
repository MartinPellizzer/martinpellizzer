<p>Stemonurus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features wiry, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stemonurus litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
