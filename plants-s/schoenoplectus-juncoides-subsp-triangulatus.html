<p>Schoenoplectus juncoides subsp.</p>
<p>triangulatus, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other similar species.</p>
