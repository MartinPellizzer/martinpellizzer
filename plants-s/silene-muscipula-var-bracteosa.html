                    <h1>Silene muscipula var. bracteosa</h1>
<p>Silene muscipula var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>This variant differs from the typical Silene muscipula by its presence of bracts and a more robust growth form.</p>
