                    <h1>Schizocalyx sterculioides</h1>
<p>Schizocalyx sterculioides, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host plant, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Schizocalyx sterculioides is often found in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of the forest ecosystem.</p>
