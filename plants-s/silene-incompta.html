<p>Silene incompta, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Silene incompta is considered an endangered species.</p>
