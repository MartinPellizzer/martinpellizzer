<p>Schnittspahnia, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with upright, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes produce spore capsules at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Schnittspahnia is characterized by its simple, primitive structure, reflecting its ancient lineage among vascular plants.</p>
