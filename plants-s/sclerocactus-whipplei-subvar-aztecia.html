<p>Sclerocactus whipplei subvar. aztecia, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a rare and striking cactus native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
