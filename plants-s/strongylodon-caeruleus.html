                    <h1>Strongylodon caeruleus</h1>
<p>Strongylodon caeruleus, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a unique, spurred structure at the base of its flowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Strongylodon caeruleus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
