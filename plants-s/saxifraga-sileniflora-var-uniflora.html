                    <h1>Saxifraga sileniflora var. uniflora</h1>
<p>Saxifraga sileniflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of white or pink, during the short summer season. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
