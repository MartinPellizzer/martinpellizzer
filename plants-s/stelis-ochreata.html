<p>Stelis ochreata, commonly known as the golden stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for structural support rather than soil. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually yellow or orange, arranged in a spike.</p>
<p>Stelis ochreata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
