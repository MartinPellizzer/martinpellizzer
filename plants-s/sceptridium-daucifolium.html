<p>Sceptridium daucifolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, leafless stems.
