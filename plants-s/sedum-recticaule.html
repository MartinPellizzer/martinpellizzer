<p>Sedum recticaule, commonly known as the upright sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a thin layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Sedum recticaule is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
