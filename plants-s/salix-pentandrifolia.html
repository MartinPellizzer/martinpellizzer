<p>Salix pentandrifolia, commonly known as the five-lobed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in early spring. Salix pentandrifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in cold climates.</p>
