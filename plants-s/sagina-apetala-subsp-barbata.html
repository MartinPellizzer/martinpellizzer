<p>Sagina apetala subsp.</p>
<p>barbata, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences near the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
