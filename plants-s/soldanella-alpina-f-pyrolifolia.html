                    <h1>Soldanella alpina f. pyrolifolia</h1>
<p>Soldanella alpina f. pyrolifolia, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its leaf morphology, which resembles that of the genus Pyrola, hence its specific epithet.</p>
