<p>Sampera ochracea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Sampera ochracea is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
