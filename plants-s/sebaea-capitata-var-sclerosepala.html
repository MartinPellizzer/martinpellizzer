<p>Sebaea capitata var. sclerosepala, commonly known as the hard-sepaled sebaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its distinct, often spiny fruit. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and the fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns from green to orange when mature.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its thick, hardened sepals that remain attached to the fruit even after maturity.</p>
