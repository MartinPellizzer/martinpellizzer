<p>Salacia oliveriana var. adiopodoumella, commonly known as the Adiopodoumella salacia, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
