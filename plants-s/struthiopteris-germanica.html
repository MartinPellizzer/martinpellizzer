<p>Struthiopteris germanica, commonly known as the European wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its delicate, biennial fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
