                    <h1>Sericographis rigida var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Sericographis rigida var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted for efficient water absorption from deep soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
