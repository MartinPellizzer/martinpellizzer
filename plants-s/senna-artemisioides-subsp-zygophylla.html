<p>Senna artemisioides subsp.</p>
<p>zygophylla, commonly known as the desert senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
