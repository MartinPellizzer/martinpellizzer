                    <h1>Saxifraga vivipara</h1>
<p>Saxifraga vivipara, commonly known as the live-bearing saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. One of its most unique features is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate on the parent plant before being dispersed.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to colonize new areas efficiently in cold, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
