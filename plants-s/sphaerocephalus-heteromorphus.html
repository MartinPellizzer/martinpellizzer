                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus heteromorphus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus heteromorphus, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, globular thallus that often appears as a cluster of greenish or reddish bumps on moist soil or rocks. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly through its surface. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
