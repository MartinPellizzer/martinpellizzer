                    <h1>Scirpus atrovirens subvar. viviparus</h1>
<p>Scirpus atrovirens subvar. viviparus, commonly known as the black rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its dark green, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in marshy environments and is often found in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant is notable for its ability to produce live offspring through its stems, which can generate new shoots at the nodes. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its use in traditional basket-making.</p>
