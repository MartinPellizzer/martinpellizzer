<p>Senecio chaenocephalus, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky flower heads that resemble a poker, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Senecio chaenocephalus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
