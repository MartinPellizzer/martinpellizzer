<p>Sapium obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and broadly ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy foliage and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
