                            <h1>Sempervivum Cuneatum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum cuneatum is a hardy succulent known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments. This plant is often referred to as the "Hen and Chicks" due to its rosette shape and clusters of small offshoots. Native to mountainous regions in Europe and western Asia, it is well adapted to rocky and alpine conditions. Its fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid climates with minimal care. This versatile plant is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
