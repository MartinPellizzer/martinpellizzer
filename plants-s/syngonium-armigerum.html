<p>Syngonium armigerum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that change color as the plant matures, often transitioning from light green to darker green or even variegated patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens.</p>
<p>Syngonium armigerum is also known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trellises.</p>
