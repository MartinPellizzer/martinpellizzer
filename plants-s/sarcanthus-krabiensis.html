                    <h1>Sarcanthus krabiensis</h1>
<p>Sarcanthus krabiensis, commonly known as the Krabi ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
