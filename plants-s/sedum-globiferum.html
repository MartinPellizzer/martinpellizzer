<p>Sedum globiferum, commonly known as the globe sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique shape and ability to bloom reliably under proper care.</p>
