<p>Salix viminalis subsp.</p>
<p>veriviminalis, commonly known as willow herb, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its rapid growth and has been used historically for basket-making and as a source of flexible willow.</p>
