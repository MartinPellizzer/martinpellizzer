                <h1>Skidanthera dentata</h1>
<p>Skidanthera dentata, commonly known as the serrated skunk cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, mottled purple and green leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its striking appearance. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Skidanthera dentata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help it survive in waterlogged soils.</p>
