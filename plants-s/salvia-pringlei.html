<p>Salvia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the rocky habitats of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy foliage that reduces water loss. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Salvia pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
