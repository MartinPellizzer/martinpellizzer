<p>Senecio cryophilus, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Senecio cryophilus is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to survive in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
