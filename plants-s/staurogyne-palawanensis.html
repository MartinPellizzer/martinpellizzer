<p>Staurogyne palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan water clover, is a unique aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Palawan, Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette-like structure, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on short stems, and it is adapted to thrive in slow-moving or still waters. Staurogyne palawanensis plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
