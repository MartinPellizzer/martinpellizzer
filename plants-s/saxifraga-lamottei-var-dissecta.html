                    <h1>Saxifraga lamottei var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Saxifraga lamottei var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Saxifragaceae family.</p>
