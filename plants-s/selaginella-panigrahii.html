                    <h1>Selaginella panigrahii</h1>
<p>Selaginella panigrahii, commonly known as the Panigrah's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces sporophytes that are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue, which helps protect them from desiccation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
