                    <h1>Setaria nubica</h1>
<p>Setaria nubica, commonly known as the cloudsetaria, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, Setaria nubica is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and degraded grasslands.</p>
