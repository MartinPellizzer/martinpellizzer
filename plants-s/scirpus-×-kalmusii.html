<p>Scirpus × kalmusii, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Scirpus maritimus and Scirpus tabernaemontani, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often used for erosion control due to their ability to stabilize soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Scirpus × kalmusii is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes, contributing to wetland biodiversity.</p>
