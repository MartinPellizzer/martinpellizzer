                    <h1>Stapelia plicata</h1>
<p>Stapelia plicata, commonly known as the pleated stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Stapelia plicata is a popular choice for collectors due to its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
