<p>Selaginella frondosa var. frondosa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky soils or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are often green or reddish in color. It produces strobila, which are cone-like structures containing spores, and is adapted to survive in arid conditions through its ability to retain moisture.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed across North America and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
