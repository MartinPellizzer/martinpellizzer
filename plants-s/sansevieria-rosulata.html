<p>Sansevieria rosulata, commonly known as the "Crown of Thorns" or "Rosette Snake Plant," is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with light green or yellowish bands. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance indoor environments.</p>
<p>Sansevieria rosulata is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and functional gardening.</p>
