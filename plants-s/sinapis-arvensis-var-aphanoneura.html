<p>Sinapis arvensis var. aphanoneura, commonly known as the slender field mustard, is a biennial or annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with smooth, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on elongated stems. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, which are long, narrow pods that split open at maturity to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
