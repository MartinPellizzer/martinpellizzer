<p>Schultesiophytum chorianthum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, succulent stem and produces small, delicate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowering period is brief, occurring only under specific environmental conditions, making it a challenging subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schultesiophytum chorianthum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
