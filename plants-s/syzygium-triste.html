                    <h1>Syzygium triste</h1>
<p>Syzygium triste, commonly known as the sad apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. Syzygium triste is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely commercially grown due to its limited yield and specific climate requirements.</p>
