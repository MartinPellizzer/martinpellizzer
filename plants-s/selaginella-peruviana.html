                    <h1>Selaginella peruviana</h1>
<p>Selaginella peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing structures. Native to South America, particularly Peru, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
