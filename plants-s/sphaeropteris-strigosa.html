                    <h1>Sphaeropteris strigosa</h1>
<p>Sphaeropteris strigosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
