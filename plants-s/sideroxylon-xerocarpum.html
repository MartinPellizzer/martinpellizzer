                    <h1>Sideroxylon xerocarpum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon xerocarpum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that contain hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon xerocarpum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
