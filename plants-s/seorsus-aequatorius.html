<p>Seorsus aequatorius, commonly known as the Ecuadorian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bioluminescent in the dark. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Seorsus aequatorius plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
