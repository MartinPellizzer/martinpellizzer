<p>Scleria foveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Scleria foveolata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
