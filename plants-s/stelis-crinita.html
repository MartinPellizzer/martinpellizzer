                    <h1>Stelis crinita</h1>
<p>Stelis crinita, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in compact clusters.</p>
<p>Stelis crinita is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained, moist substrates.</p>
