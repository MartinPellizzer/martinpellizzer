                    <h1>Salix agrophylla</h1>
<p>Salix agrophylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Salix agrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its flexible branches in basket-making.</p>
