                    <h1>Saxifraga carpetana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga carpetana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga carpetana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging ecological conditions.</p>
