                    <h1>Schizolegnia orbiculata</h1>
<p>Schizolegnia orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is native to regions of South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
