                    <h1>Synaedrys merrittii</h1>
<p>Synaedrys merrittii, commonly known as the Merritt's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
