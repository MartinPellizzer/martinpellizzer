<p>Solanum acaule var. caulescens, commonly known as the naked stem nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its unique morphology.</p>

The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep purple or black, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
