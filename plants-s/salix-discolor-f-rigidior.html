<p>Salix discolor f. rigidior, commonly known as the stiff willow or rigid weeping willow, is a unique variant of the weeping willow species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright branches that contrast with the more drooping growth of the typical weeping willow. This plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
