                    <h1>Sciuris ossana</h1>
<p>Sciuris ossana, commonly known as the hairy antler fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciuris ossana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
