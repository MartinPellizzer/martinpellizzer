<p>Struthiopteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican wood fern, is a species of fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
