<p>Salsola boissieri subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, heavy metal-rich soils. It possesses succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and is often found in rocky, coastal, or semi-arid regions. Its ability to tolerate high levels of heavy metals like nickel and cadmium makes it ecologically significant in serpentine soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
