<p>Solenidium portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Solenidium portillae is considered critically endangered.</p>
