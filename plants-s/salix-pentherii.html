<p>Salix pentherii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters and serve as the primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
