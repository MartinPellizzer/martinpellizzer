                    <h1>Salix bradfordii</h1>
<p>Salix bradfordii, commonly known as the Bradford poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth, heart-shaped leaves, and distinctive weeping habit. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to diseases and has a relatively short lifespan, making it less suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
