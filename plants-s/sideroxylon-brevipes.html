<p>Sideroxylon brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and durable timber, it is a valuable but relatively rare species in its natural habitat.</p>
