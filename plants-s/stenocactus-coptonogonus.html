<p>Stenocactus coptonogonus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water.</p>
<p>The woolly covering helps to reduce water loss and protect the plant from intense sunlight and herbivores.</p>
