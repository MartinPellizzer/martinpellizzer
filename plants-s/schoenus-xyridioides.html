<p>Schoenus xyridioides, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense tussocks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
