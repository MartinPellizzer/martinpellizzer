                    <h1>Stenotyla estrellensis</h1>
<p>Stenotyla estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan rock cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
