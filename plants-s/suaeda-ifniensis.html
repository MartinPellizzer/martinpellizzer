<p>Suaeda ifniensis, commonly known as the Ifni saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Suaeda ifniensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its harsh habitat.</p>
