                    <h1>Stizolophus</h1>
<p>Stizolophus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. They possess a unique structure called a strobilus, which is a cone-like structure that bears the reproductive organs. Stizolophus species are characterized by their spirally arranged leaves and spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>They play an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
