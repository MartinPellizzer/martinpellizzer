<p>Saxifraga retusa subsp.</p>
<p>wulfeniana, commonly known as the Woolly Saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and high-altitude landscapes.</p>
