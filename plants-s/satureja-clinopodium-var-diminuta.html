<p>Satureja clinopodium var. diminuta, commonly known as dwarf savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary applications due to their pungent, slightly minty flavor. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members like rosemary and thyme.</p>
