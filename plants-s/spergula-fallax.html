<p>Spergula fallax, commonly known as false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Spergula fallax is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
