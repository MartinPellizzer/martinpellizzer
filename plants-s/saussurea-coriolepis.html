<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
