<p>Stapelia brevirostris, commonly known as the short-beaked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, such as flies, rather than bees or butterflies.</p>
<p>Stapelia brevirostris is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
