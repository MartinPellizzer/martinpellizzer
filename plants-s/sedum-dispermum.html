<p>Sedum dispermum, commonly known as the two-seeded stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum dispermum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its resilience and low maintenance requirements make it an excellent plant for drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
