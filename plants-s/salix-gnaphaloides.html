                    <h1>Salix gnaphaloides</h1>
<p>Salix gnaphaloides, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly appearance, which is due to a dense covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family, and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Salix gnaphaloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
