                    <h1>Scutellaria sosnowskyi</h1>
<p>Scutellaria sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's blueweed, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
