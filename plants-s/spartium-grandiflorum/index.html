                            <h1>Spartium Grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Spanish broom, scientifically known as Spartium grandiflorum, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and dense, thorny growth, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. While admired for its vibrant blooms, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found along coastal areas and disturbed lands. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a subject of both ecological concern and horticultural interest.</p>
