                    <h1>Strychnos goiasensis</h1>
<p>Strychnos goiasensis, commonly known as the Goyazinha or Brazilian poisonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. Its toxicity is due to the presence of alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which make it harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
