<p>Sedum rupestre subsp.</p>
<p>montanum, commonly known as the stonecress, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil.</p>
