                    <h1>Salsola vermiculata var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Salsola vermiculata var. microphylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
