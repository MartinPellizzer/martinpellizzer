<p>Sciaphila andajensis, commonly known as the Andean shadow orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid but often nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciaphila andajensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
