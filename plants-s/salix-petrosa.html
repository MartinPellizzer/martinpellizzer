                    <h1>Salix petrosa</h1>
<p>Salix petrosa, commonly known as the rock willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras.</p>
<p>Salix petrosa is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
