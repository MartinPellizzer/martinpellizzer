                    <h1>Scilla patula</h1>
<p>Scilla patula, commonly known as the broadleaf scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to violet flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Scilla patula is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
