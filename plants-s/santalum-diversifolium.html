<p>Santalum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important component of certain Australian ecosystems.</p>
