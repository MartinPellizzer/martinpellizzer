<p>Stellaria cucubaloides, commonly known as the cushion starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers throughout the summer months. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Stellaria cucubaloides is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
