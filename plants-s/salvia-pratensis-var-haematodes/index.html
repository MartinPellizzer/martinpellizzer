                            <h1>Salvia Pratensis Var. Haematodes</h1>
<p>Salvia pratensis var. haematodes, commonly known as the blood sage, is a striking perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. This striking plant is recognized for its vivid purple to crimson flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its unique coloration and architectural form make it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike. The variety haematodes stands out due to its deep, almost blood-red hue, which sets it apart from other salvia species. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making it a rewarding but somewhat demanding addition to any garden.</p>
