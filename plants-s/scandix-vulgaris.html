                    <h1>Scandix vulgaris</h1>
<p>Scandix vulgaris, commonly known as common hogweed, is a tall, biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in midsummer, followed by cylindrical, reddish-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and requires caution when handling.</p>
