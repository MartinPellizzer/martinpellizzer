                    <h1>Salix rupifraga f. eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix rupifraga f. eriocarpa, commonly known as the wooly willow, is a shrub native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which provides insulation against harsh weather conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or tundra environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and habitat support.</p>
