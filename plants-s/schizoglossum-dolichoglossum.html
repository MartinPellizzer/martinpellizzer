<p>It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. Its thallus is usually green or yellowish in color, and it lacks distinct rhizines.</p>
<p>Schizoglossum dolichoglossum is often found in temperate regions and is relatively uncommon in the wild.</p>
