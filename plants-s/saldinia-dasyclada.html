<p>Saldinia dasyclada, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its reproductive structures are adapted to disperse seeds through the wind, ensuring propagation in its challenging environment.</p>
<p>Saldinia dasyclada plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
