<p>Sempervivum diplocyclum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue or green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Sempervivum diplocyclum is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
