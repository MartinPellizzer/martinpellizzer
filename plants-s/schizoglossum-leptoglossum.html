<p>Schizoglossum leptoglossum, commonly known as the slender-lipped schizoglossum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single stem that bears a cluster of flowers at the top.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Schizoglossum leptoglossum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
