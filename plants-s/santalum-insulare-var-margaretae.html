                    <h1>Santalum insulare var. margaretae</h1>
<p>Santalum insulare var. margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and woody, branching structure. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its fragrant heartwood is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
