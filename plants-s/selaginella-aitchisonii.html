                    <h1>Selaginella aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Selaginella aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping stem that produces sporangia along its length. Native to the arid regions of Pakistan and India, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils with minimal water. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis.</p>
<p>Its morphology and adaptations make it an important subject in the study of plant resilience and evolutionary biology.</p>
