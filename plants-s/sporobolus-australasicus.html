                    <h1>Sporobolus australasicus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus australasicus, commonly known as the Australian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of specialized structures called awns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Sporobolus australasicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
