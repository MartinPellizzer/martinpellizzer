<p>Silene cuatrecasasii var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, high-altitude environment. Its seeds are small and capsule-like, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
