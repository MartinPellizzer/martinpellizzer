<p>Stylogyne turbacensis subsp.</p>
<p>turbacensis, commonly known as the bog lily, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in peat bogs and other waterlogged soils, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its leaves are linear and often submerged or floating, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
