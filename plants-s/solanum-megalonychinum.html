                    <h1>Solanum megalonychinum</h1>
<p>Solanum megalonychinum, commonly known as the large-leaf nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple. Its berries, which are toxic, mature to a bright red color and are often mistaken for edible fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
