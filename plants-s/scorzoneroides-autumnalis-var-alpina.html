<p>Scorzoneroides autumnalis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine autumn scorzoneroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing pale blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
