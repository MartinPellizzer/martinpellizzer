                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos roemerianus</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos roemerianus, commonly known as the Roemer's globe flower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, globe-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
