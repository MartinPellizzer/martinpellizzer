                    <h1>Sarracenia flava var. picta</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava var. picta, commonly known as the yellow pitcherplant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a red-veined, hooded structure that helps funnel prey into the hollow leaf blade. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variant is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological role in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
