                    <h1>Stelis calotricha</h1>
<p>Stelis calotricha, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, coral-like inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis calotricha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
