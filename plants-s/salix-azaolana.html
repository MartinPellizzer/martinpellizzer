                    <h1>Salix azaolana</h1>
<p>Salix azaolana, commonly known as the Azores willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Azores Islands in Portugal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its production of small, catkin-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
