                    <h1>Sphenanthera multangula var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Sphenanthera multangula var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-flowered sphenanthera, is a variant of the sphenanthera genus native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique arrangement that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
