<p>Stapelia glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, meaty flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a waxy texture. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia glandulifera is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in low-water conditions.</p>
