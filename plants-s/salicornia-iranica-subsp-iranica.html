<p>Salicornia iranica subsp.</p>
<p>iranica, commonly known as Iranian glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran, where it thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, succulent stems that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest for its potential in phytoremediation and as a source of edible salt-tolerant vegetation.</p>
