<p>Sisymbrella boissieri subsp.</p>
<p>praeterita, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the family Brassicaceae. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients.</p>
<p>This species typically attaches to the roots of other plants, such as those in the genus Brassica, through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and is often found in disturbed or arid soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
