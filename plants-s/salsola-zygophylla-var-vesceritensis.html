                    <h1>Salsola zygophylla var. vesceritensis</h1>
<p>Salsola zygophylla var. vesceritensis, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, edible berries that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in steppe and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to extreme drought and high salinity, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
