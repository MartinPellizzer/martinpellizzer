<p>Synaphea nexosa, commonly known as the slender synaphea, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, thalloid structure and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture effectively. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are small and cup-like, containing spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Synaphea nexosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
