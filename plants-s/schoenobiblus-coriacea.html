                    <h1>Schoenobiblus coriacea</h1>
<p>Schoenobiblus coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with low water availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
