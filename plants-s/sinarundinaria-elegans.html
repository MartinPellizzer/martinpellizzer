<p>Sinarundinaria elegans, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a fern species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spores are released from small, round sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Sinarundinaria elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
