<p>Sisymbrium mariolense, commonly known as the maritime crucifer, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, adapting to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are lobed and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium mariolense plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
