<p>Selaginella chingii, commonly known as the Chinese spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form compact, moss-like clusters. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Selaginella chingii typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
