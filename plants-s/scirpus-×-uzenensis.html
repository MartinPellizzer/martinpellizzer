<p>Scirpus × uzenensis, commonly known as the Uzen marsh reed, is a hybrid grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow waters, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Scirpus × uzenensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
