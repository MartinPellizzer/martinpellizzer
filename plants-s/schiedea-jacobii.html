                    <h1>Schiedea jacobii</h1>
<p>Schiedea jacobii, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of silver-gray leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Schiedea jacobii thrives in high-elevation habitats, such as the volcanic slopes of Haleakalā, where it is adapted to cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
