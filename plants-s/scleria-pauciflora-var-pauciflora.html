                    <h1>Scleria pauciflora var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Scleria pauciflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
