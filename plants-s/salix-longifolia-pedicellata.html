                    <h1>Salix longifolia pedicellata</h1>
<p>Salix longifolia pedicellata, commonly known as the longcat willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and long, pendulous catkins that give it its common name. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, making it a valuable plant for riparian habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are grouped in elongated, drooping clusters called catkins.</p>
