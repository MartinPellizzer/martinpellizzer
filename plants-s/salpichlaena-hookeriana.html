<p>Salpichlaena hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense, spiky foliage. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
