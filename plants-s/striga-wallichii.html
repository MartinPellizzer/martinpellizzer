<p>Striga wallichii, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India, China, and Nepal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it a significant agricultural pest, particularly in crops like wheat and barley.</p>
