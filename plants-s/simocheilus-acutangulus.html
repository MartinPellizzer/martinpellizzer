                    <h1>Simocheilus acutangulus</h1>
<p>Simocheilus acutangulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it anchors itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in stabilizing the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The fronds are often divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
