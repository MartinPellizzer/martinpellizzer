<p>Saxicolella nana, commonly known as the dwarf saxicolella, is a small, cushion-like plant native to the rocky habitats of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compact growth form and dense, mat-like structure. The plant typically has small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Saxicolella nana is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
