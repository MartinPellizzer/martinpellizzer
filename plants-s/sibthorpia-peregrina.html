<p>Sibthorpia peregrina, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sibthorpia peregrina is well-suited to low-water conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
