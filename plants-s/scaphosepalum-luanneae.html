<p>Scaphosepalum luanneae, commonly known as the Luanne's ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and slender, white to pale green inflorescences. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly figures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Scaphosepalum luanneae is extremely difficult to study and conserve.</p>
