                    <h1>Sphacophyllum welwitschii</h1>
<p>Sphacophyllum welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's moss, is a unique and rare species of liverwort found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct lobes and a system of rhizoids that anchor it to its substrate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
