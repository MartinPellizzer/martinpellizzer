<p>Serjania reticulata f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf serjania, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Serjaniaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
