                    <h1>Selaginella palembanica var. subtrinervia</h1>
<p>Selaginella palembanica var. subtrinervia, commonly known as the palembangan spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly recurved. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in short, branched structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
