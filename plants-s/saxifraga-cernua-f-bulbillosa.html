                    <h1>Saxifraga cernua f. bulbillosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga cernua f. bulbillosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its bulbils, small plantlets that form along the stems and can detach to grow into new plants.</p>
