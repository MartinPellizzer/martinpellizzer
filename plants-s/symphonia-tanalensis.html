                    <h1>Symphonia tanalensis</h1>
<p>Symphonia tanalensis, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly resistant to decay and insect damage.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, it is also considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
