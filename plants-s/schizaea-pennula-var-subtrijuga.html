                    <h1>Schizaea pennula var. subtrijuga</h1>
<p>Schizaea pennula var. subtrijuga, commonly known as the triquetrous whisk fern, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves and root-like structures called rhizomes. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology reflects its evolutionary history as a primitive plant with reduced foliage.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, providing insights into early plant evolution.</p>
