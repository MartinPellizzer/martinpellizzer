<p>Sabulina fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
