                    <h1>Spartina fasciculata</h1>
<p>Spartina fasciculata, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and brackish environments. The plant typically grows in marshes, tidal flats, and other wetland habitats where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Spartina fasciculata produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
