                    <h1>Stapelia caespitosa</h1>
<p>Stapelia caespitosa, commonly known as the Cape Town Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, clustered growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia caespitosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
