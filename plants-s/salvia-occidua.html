<p>Salvia occidua, commonly known as the desert sage, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and spikes of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Salvia occidua is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
