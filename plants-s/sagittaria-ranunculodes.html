<p>Sagittaria ranunculodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging above the water.</p>
