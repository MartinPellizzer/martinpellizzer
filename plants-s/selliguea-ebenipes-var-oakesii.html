                    <h1>Selliguea ebenipes var. oakesii</h1>
<p>Selliguea ebenipes var. oakesii, commonly known as the Oakes' rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices where it can anchor itself securely. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species.</p>
