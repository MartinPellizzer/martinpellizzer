                <h1>Senegalia giganticarpa</h1>
<p>Senegalia giganticarpa, commonly known as the giant screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spiral-shaped pods and bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, woody, spiral-curved seed pods. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Senegalia giganticarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
