                    <h1>Sempervivum umbelliforme</h1>
<p>Sempervivum umbelliforme, commonly known as the "Crown of Thorns," is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or violet during the summer months. It is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Sempervivum umbelliforme is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal.</p>
