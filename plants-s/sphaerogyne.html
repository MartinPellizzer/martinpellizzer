                    <h1>Sphaerogyne</h1>
<p>Sphaerogyne, commonly known as the "globe moss," is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Sphaerogyne species are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth form and their ability to thrive in humid conditions. The plants have a thalloid structure, with a flattened, green body that serves as the primary photosynthetic organ.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats.</p>
