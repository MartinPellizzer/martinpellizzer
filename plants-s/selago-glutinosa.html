                    <h1>Selago glutinosa</h1>
<p>Selago glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Australia and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its sticky, glandular hairs on the leaves and stems give it a distinctive appearance and help deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Selago glutinosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
