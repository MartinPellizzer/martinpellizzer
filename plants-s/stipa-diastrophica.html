                    <h1>Stipa diastrophica</h1>
<p>Stipa diastrophica, commonly known as the broadleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of grasses, and these are often adorned with long, feathery bristles. Stipa diastrophica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
