                    <h1>Stenotus pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Stenotus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it conserve moisture in its native environment.</p>
<p>Stenotus pygmaeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
