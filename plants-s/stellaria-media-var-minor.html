<p>Stellaria media var. minor, commonly known as lesser mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual or biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also be cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
