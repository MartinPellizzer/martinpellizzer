                <h1>Sisymbrium columnae</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium columnae, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a rootless plant that relies on a symbiotic relationship with host plants for nutrients, as it lacks true roots. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
