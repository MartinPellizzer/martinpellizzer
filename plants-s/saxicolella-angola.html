                    <h1>Saxicolella angola</h1>
<p>Saxicolella angola, commonly known as the Angola saxicolella, is a member of the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Saxicolella angola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
