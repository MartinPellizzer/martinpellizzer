                    <h1>Sagittaria amazonica</h1>
<p>Sagittaria amazonica, commonly known as the Amazon arrowhead, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically submerged, though some may emerge above the water. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and wetlands.</p>
<p>Sagittaria amazonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
