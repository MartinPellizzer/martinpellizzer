<p>Serapias vomeracea subsp.</p>
<p>levantina, commonly known as the Levant sand orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or limestone areas.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with a distinctive structure that facilitates nectar access.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution.</p>
