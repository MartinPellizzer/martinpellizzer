<p>Stereochlaena tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping, and the fronds are usually divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
