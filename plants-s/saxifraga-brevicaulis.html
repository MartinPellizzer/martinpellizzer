                    <h1>Saxifraga brevicaulis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga brevicaulis is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
