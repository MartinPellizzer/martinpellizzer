                    <h1>Selaginella agastyamalayana</h1>
<p>Selaginella agastyamalayana, commonly known as the Agastyamalayana spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive spore-producing structures called strobila. Native to the Western Ghats of India, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat, with a low-growing habit and a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
