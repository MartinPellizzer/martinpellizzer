<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized structures called strobila. Its reproductive structures, known as microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
