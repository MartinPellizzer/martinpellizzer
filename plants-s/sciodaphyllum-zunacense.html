<p>Sciodaphyllum zunacense, commonly known as the Zunac cloud forest tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and a distinctive, slender trunk that often grows in dense, humid environments. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to high-altitude conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. It plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, Sciodaphyllum zunacense is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
