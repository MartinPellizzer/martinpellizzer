<p>Sarcostemma arabicum, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to the arid regions of India and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in wastelands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Sarcostemma arabicum is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxic nature.</p>
