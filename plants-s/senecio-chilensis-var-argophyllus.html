<p>Senecio chilensis var. argophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and ability to tolerate dry conditions.</p>
