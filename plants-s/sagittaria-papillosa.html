                    <h1>Sagittaria papillosa</h1>
<p>Sagittaria papillosa, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>Sagittaria papillosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
