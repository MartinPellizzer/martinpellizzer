<p>It is a saprophytic fungus that decomposes wood, primarily found in temperate and subtropical regions. The fruiting bodies are small, with a cap that often splits into distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The spores are released from the gills, which are closely spaced and not decurrent.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
