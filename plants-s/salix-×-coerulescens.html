                    <h1>Salix × coerulescens</h1>
<p>Salix × coerulescens, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white or pale green leaves, which contrast with its slender, often silver-gray stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
