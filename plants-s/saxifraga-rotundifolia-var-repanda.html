<p>Saxifraga rotundifolia var. repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical Saxifraga rotundifolia by its broader leaf shape and more compact growth habit.</p>
