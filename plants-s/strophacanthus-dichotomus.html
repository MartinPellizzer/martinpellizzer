                    <h1>Strophacanthus dichotomus</h1>
<p>Strophacanthus dichotomus, commonly known as the dichotomous strophacanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique branching pattern, with stems dividing into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive dichotomous growth habit. The plant typically features small, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are simple and clustered, producing small, pale yellow blooms that are not particularly showy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
