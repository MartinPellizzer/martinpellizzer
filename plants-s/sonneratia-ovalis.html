<p>Sonneratia ovalis, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Sonneratia ovalis is often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats across Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
