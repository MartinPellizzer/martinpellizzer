The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
