<p>Selliguea lagunensis, commonly known as the coastal liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments, particularly near coastal areas. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it retain moisture and withstand salt spray. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are usually located on the upper surfaces of its leaves.</p>
<p>Selliguea lagunensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
