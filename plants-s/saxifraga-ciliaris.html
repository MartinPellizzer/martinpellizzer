                    <h1>Saxifraga ciliaris</h1>
<p>Saxifraga ciliaris, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the summer, which are often surrounded by delicate, thread-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Saxifraga ciliaris is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
