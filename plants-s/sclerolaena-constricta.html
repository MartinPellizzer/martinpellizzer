                    <h1>Sclerolaena constricta</h1>
<p>Sclerolaena constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open grasslands or along roadsides. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common strategy among members of the Asteraceae family. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sclerolaena constricta is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
