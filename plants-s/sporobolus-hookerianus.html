                    <h1>Sporobolus hookerianus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus hookerianus, commonly known as Hooker's sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability.</p>
<p>Sporobolus hookerianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
