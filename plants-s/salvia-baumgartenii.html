                    <h1>Salvia baumgartenii</h1>
<p>Salvia baumgartenii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and striking spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Salvia baumgartenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions.</p>
