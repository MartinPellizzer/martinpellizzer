                    <h1>Salix ischnoclada</h1>
<p>Salix ischnoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid environments.</p>
