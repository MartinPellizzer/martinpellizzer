<p>Saxifraga asiatica, commonly known as the Asian saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often on slopes or cliffs where it can anchor itself in crevices. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga asiatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy ground cover.</p>
