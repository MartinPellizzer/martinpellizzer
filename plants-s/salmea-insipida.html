<p>Salmea insipida, commonly known as the insipid salmea, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, characterized by their succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the early morning, adapted to attract specific pollinators.
