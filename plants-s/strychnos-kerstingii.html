<p>Strychnos kerstingii, commonly known as the kersting's nux vomica, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a white, fleshy aril. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and roots.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution.</p>
