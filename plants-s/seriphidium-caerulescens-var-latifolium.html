<p>Seriphidium caerulescens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf gumweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its aromatic foliage, which has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
