                    <h1>Saussurea cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Saussurea cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saussurea cavaleriei is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.</p>
