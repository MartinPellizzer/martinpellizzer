<p>Saxifraga hibernica, commonly known as the Irish saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe, particularly Ireland and the British Isles.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky outcrops. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Saxifraga hibernica is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
