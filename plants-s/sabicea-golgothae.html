                    <h1>Sabicea golgothae</h1>
<p>Sabicea golgothae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ethereal appearance. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabicea golgothae is considered critically endangered.</p>
