<p>Sempervivum leptopetalum, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a woolly texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months.
