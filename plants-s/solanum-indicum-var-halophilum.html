                    <h1>Solanum indicum var. halophilum</h1>
<p>Solanum indicum var. halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush or halophyte nightshade, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to regions with high salt content in the soil. The plant exhibits succulent leaves and stems to store water, which helps it survive in arid and coastal areas. It produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in phytoremediation to reclaim saline soils.</p>
