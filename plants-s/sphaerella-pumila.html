<p>Sphaerella pumila, commonly known as the little sphere lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on bark and soil.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish-green thallus with a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic association with algae for photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Sphaerella pumila is a slow-growing species that plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
