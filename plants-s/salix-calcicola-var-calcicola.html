<p>Salix calcicola var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
