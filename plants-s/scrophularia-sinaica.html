<p>Scrophularia sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East, particularly the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. It produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scrophularia sinaica is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
