                    <h1>Salix woodii</h1>
<p>Salix woodii, commonly known as Wood's willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often near streams or in rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix woodii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
