<p>Sarcochilus societatis, commonly known as the Society's sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip, which attracts pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
