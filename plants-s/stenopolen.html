                    <h1>Stenopolen</h1>
<p>Stenopolen, commonly known as the narrow-pollen plant, is a rare and specialized flowering plant species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pollen structure, which is more elongated and narrow compared to typical pollen grains. This plant is often found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and moisture conditions. Its reproductive biology is closely tied to specific pollinators that can navigate its specialized pollen morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Stenopolen is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
