<p>Solanum ramosissimum, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems, small greenish-yellow flowers, and edible, berry-like fruits that resemble tomatoes. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and has adapted to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Solanum ramosissimum is part of the nightshade family and contains compounds that can be toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
