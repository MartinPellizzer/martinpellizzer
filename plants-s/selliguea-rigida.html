<p>Selliguea rigida, commonly known as the rigid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, carpet-like moss that typically grows on soil, rocks, or tree bark in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and closely appressed, with a distinctive ribbed structure that aids in water retention. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the leafy shoots.</p>
<p>Selliguea rigida is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
