                    <h1>Smilax pubera</h1>
<p>Smilax pubera, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in stiff, backward-pointing spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Smilax pubera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks.</p>
