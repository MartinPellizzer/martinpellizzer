                    <h1>Sabal peregrina</h1>
<p>Sabal peregrina, commonly known as the cabbage palm, is a tall, evergreen palm native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered with a fibrous, spongy layer called the fibrovascular sheath. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 8 feet in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, and it produces edible, yellowish fruit that is consumed by various wildlife.</p>
<p>Sabal peregrina is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
