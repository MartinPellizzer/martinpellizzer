<p>Silene decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, erect stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
