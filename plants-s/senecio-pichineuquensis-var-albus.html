                    <h1>Senecio pichineuquensis var. albus</h1>
<p>Senecio pichineuquensis var. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered pichineuquensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and high sunlight exposure. Its white flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale or white floral coloration, setting it apart from other varieties of Senecio pichineuquensis.</p>
