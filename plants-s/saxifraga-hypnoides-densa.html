                    <h1>Saxifraga hypnoides densa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hypnoides densa, commonly known as the dense saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually succulent, which helps it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga hypnoides densa is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
