                    <h1>Siphanthera pusilla</h1>
<p>Siphanthera pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a small, hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of coniferous trees such as Douglas fir and true firs. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It relies on its host tree for nutrients and water, while also providing a food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Siphanthera pusilla plays a unique role in forest ecosystems, contributing to the ecological balance through its parasitic relationship and seed dispersal.</p>
