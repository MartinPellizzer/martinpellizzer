                    <h1>Styloncerus phyllocephalus</h1>
<p>Styloncerus phyllocephalus, commonly known as the leaf-headed antlion, is a species of predatory insect found in various regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrmeleontidae, which includes antlions and their relatives. The plant association of this species is not direct, as it is an insect rather than a plant; however, it is often found in habitats with specific vegetation. Its name suggests a possible morphological resemblance to plant structures, though this is not a botanical feature.</p>
<p>The insect's ecological role is more related to its predatory behavior rather than any botanical characteristics.</p>
