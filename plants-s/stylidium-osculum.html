<p>Stylidium osculum, commonly known as the false sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions and has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stylidium osculum is also known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the seeds are explosively ejected when mature.</p>
