<p>Setaria grandis, commonly known as giant millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are used as a food source. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid regions.</p>
<p>Setaria grandis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agricultural systems.</p>
