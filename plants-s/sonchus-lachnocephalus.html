                    <h1>Sonchus lachnocephalus</h1>
<p>Sonchus lachnocephalus, commonly known as the purple milk thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, followed by spiny, spherical seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
