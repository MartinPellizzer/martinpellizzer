                    <h1>Stalagmitis cowa</h1>
<p>Stalagmitis cowa, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant features elongated, slender fronds with a silvery sheen that reflects light, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Stalagmitis cowa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
