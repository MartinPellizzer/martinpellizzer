                    <h1>Stenocactus jarmilae</h1>
<p>Stenocactus jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the dry regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts.</p>
