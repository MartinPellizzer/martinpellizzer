<p>Schoenus melanostachys, commonly known as black-stalked sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and swampy areas in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, triangular stems that are typically dark brown or black, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
<p>Schoenus melanostachys is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
