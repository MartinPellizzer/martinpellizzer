<p>Sclerophylax cuyanus, commonly known as the Cuy Valley sclerophyll, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, dry fruits. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with a branching structure that helps it withstand strong winds and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Sclerophylax cuyanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
