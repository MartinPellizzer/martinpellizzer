                    <h1>Selaginella martensii var. congesta</h1>
<p>Selaginella martensii var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered spikemoss, is a species of moss plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
