<p>Sorbus intermedia var. arranensis, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive shrub or small tree native to the Isle of Arran in Scotland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, white to pale yellow berries that appear in late summer. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated edge, and turn a striking red or orange in the autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable component of the local biodiversity.</p>
