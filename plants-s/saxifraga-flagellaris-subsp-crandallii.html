<p>Saxifraga flagellaris subsp.</p>
<p>crandallii, commonly known as the Crandall's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with succulent, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five to seven petals, often in shades of pink or white, during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
