                    <h1>Sciaphila janthina</h1>
<p>Sciaphila janthina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a thick, spongy coating. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Sciaphila janthina is considered endangered.</p>
