<p>Sasa yenaensis, commonly known as the Yena bamboo, is a clump-forming grass found in the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Sasa yenaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of sustainable materials.</p>
