<p>Salsola kali subsp.</p>
<p>gmelinii, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often invasive in non-native regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
