                    <h1>Solidago alpestris</h1>
<p>Solidago alpestris, commonly known as alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Solidago alpestris plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in steep, rocky areas.</p>
