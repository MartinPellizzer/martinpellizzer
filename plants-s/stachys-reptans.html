                    <h1>Stachys reptans</h1>
<p>Stachys reptans, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Stachys reptans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
