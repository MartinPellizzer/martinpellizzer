<p>Serapias × wettsteinii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>wettsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias wettsteinii. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in wet meadows and marshy areas.</p>
<p>The plant produces strikingly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow and orange, with a distinctive hooded structure. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
