It produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent purple or brown lip. The plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
