                    <h1>Sagittaria cordifolia</h1>
<p>Sagittaria cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive heart-like base. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that emerge from the water surface, typically in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water areas, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Sagittaria cordifolia plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
