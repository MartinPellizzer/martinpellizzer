                    <h1>Syngonanthus lanceolatus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It attaches to the stems of its host plants, primarily in the genus *Pouteria*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are consumed by various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are lanceolate, hence the species name, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Syngonanthus lanceolatus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
