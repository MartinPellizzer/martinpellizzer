                    <h1>Salix reticulata var. nana</h1>
<p>Salix reticulata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems forming a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
