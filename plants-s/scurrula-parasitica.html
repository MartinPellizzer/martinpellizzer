                    <h1>Scurrula parasitica</h1>
<p>Scurrula parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It typically grows on the roots of woody plants, often in forested or shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
