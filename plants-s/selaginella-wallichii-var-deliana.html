                    <h1>Selaginella wallichii var. deliana</h1>
<p>Selaginella wallichii var. deliana, commonly known as the Himalayan spike moss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in dense, spiral patterns along its stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure resembles that of a moss, though it is more closely related to ferns.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
