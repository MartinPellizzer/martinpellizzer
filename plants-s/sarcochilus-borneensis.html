                    <h1>Sarcochilus borneensis</h1>
<p>Sarcochilus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces fleshy, leathery pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Sarcochilus borneensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
