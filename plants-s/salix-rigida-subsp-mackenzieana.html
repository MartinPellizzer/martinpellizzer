<p>Salix rigida subsp.</p>
<p>mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie's willow, is a shrub native to the arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and its leaves are small, narrow, and often hairy. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental plant.</p>
