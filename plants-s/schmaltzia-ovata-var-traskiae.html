                    <h1>Schmaltzia ovata var. traskiae</h1>
<p>Schmaltzia ovata var. traskiae, commonly known as the Trask's Schmaltzia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
