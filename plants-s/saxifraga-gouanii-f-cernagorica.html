<p>Saxifraga gouanii f. cernagorica, commonly known as the hanging saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its drooping inflorescence, which gives it its common name.</p>
