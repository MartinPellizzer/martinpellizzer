                    <h1>Syngonanthus nitens var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus nitens var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous grassveld sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. One of its notable features is viviparity, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
