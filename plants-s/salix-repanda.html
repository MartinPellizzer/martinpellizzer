                    <h1>Salix repanda</h1>
<p>Salix repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and glossy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. Salix repanda thrives in moist, often boggy soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
