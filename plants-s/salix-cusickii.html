<p>Salix cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to the seasonal color changes in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Salix cusickii is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows.</p>
