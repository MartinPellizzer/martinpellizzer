                    <h1>Sedum jordanianum</h1>
<p>Sedum jordanianum, commonly known as Jordanian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
