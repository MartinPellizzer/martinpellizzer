<p>Sempervivum ballii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Sempervivum ballii is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
