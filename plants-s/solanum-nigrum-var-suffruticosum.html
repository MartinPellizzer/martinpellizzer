<p>Solanum nigrum var. suffruticosum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems that become more branched as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of glossy, black berries when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The berries are toxic when unripe but become edible once fully mature, though they are often consumed in traditional cuisines.</p>
