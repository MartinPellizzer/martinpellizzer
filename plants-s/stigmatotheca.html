                    <h1>Stigmatotheca</h1>
<p>Stigmatotheca, commonly known as the stigma-bearing structure in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It is a specialized organ found in the female reproductive system of angiosperms, primarily responsible for receiving pollen grains during pollination. The stigmatotheca typically consists of a sticky surface that enhances the adhesion of pollen, facilitating fertilization. Its morphology can vary among species, often featuring a feathery or lobed structure to increase surface area.</p>
<p>This structure plays a crucial role in the reproductive success of the plant by ensuring effective pollination.</p>
