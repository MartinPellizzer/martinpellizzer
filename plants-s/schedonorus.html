                    <h1>Schedonorus</h1>
<p>Schedonorus, commonly known as bentgrass, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in low, dense tufts and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Schedonorus species are characterized by their fine, soft blades and compact growth habit, which make them popular in turfgrass applications. They have fibrous root systems that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
