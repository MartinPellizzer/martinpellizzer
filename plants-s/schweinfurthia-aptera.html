<p>Schweinfurthia aptera, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Schweinfurthia aptera is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
