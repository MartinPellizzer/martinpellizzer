                <h1>Stelis brenneri</h1>
<p>Stelis brenneri, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
