                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris f. montanensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris f. montanensis, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a fern ally native to mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
