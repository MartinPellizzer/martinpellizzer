                    <h1>Scolopendrium × lobatum</h1>
<p>Scolopendrium × lobatum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a hybrid evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, arching frond structure with a bright green, waxy appearance that resembles a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, turning a coppery brown in the fall before regrowing in the spring.</p>
