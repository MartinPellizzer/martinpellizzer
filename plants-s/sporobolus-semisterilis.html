<p>Sporobolus semisterilis, commonly known as the slender speargrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, as the plant lacks a well-developed glume, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>Sporobolus semisterilis is a resilient species that plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
