                    <h1>Sudamerlycaste lanipes</h1>
<p>Sudamerlycaste lanipes, commonly known as the hairy-footed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Myrtus, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sudamerlycaste lanipes is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
