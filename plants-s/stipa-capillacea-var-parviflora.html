                    <h1>Stipa capillacea var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Stipa capillacea var. parviflora, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and tufted, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant landscaping plant.</p>
<p>The variety parviflora is distinguished by its smaller flower clusters compared to the typical form of S. capillacea.</p>
