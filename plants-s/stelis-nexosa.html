                    <h1>Stelis nexosa</h1>
<p>Stelis nexosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Stelis nexosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
