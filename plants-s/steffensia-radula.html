                    <h1>Steffensia radula</h1>
<p>Steffensia radula, commonly known as the radula lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a dense, leathery layer on rocks or soil. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which together form the lichen structure. Steffensia radula thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
