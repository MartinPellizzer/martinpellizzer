<p>Salix anadyrensis, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers early in the growing season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Salix anadyrensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic flora and fauna.</p>
