                    <h1>Solanum membranisepalum</h1>
<p>Solanum membranisepalum, commonly known as the membranous-sepaled nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, membranous sepals that remain attached to the fruit even after maturity. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and a superior ovary, and it produces small, round berries that are often green when immature and turn red when ripe.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological significance.</p>
