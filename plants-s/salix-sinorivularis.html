                    <h1>Salix sinorivularis</h1>
<p>Salix sinorivularis, commonly known as the Chinese willow or river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to wet soils makes it an important species for stabilizing riverbanks and preventing erosion.</p>
