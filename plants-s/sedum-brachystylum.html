                    <h1>Sedum brachystylum</h1>
<p>Sedum brachystylum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance, Sedum brachystylum is often used in landscaping to add texture and color to drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
