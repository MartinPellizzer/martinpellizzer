                    <h1>Silene tmolea</h1>
<p>Silene tmolea, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions through its deep root system and succulent leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Silene tmolea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
