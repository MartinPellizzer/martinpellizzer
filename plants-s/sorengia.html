                    <h1>Sorengia</h1>
<p>Sorengia, commonly known as the "wild lettuce," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their hairy stems, alternate leaves, and composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. Sorengia species are typically found in temperate regions and often grow in disturbed soils or along roadsides. They have a long history of use in traditional medicine for their mild sedative and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>The plant's latex contains compounds that can be irritating to the skin, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
