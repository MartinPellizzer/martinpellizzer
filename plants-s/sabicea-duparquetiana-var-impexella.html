                    <h1>Sabicea duparquetiana var. impexella</h1>
<p>Sabicea duparquetiana var. impexella, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody stems and slow growth rate make it a valuable but difficult-to-cultivate species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
