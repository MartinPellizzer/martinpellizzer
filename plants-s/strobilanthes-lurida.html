                    <h1>Strobilanthes lurida</h1>
<p>Strobilanthes lurida, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its unique, orchid-like flowers that are often pale green or white, with a delicate appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Strobilanthes lurida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
