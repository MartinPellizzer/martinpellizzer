<p>Syngonanthus xeranthemoides var. strigillosus, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
