                    <h1>Selaginella brasiliensis var. crassinervia</h1>
<p>Selaginella brasiliensis var. crassinervia, commonly known as the Brazilian spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called strobila.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation, a trait known as cryptobiosis. The plant has a rosette-like growth form with long, slender leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are typically clustered at the tips of its stems, making it distinct from other mosses and liverworts.</p>
