<p>Senecio balsamitae, commonly known as Balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves.

It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments, and it can spread aggressively through both seeds and vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
