<p>Sisymbrium burchellii, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to October. Its leaves are alternate and narrow, and it lacks true stems, growing as a rosette of leaves.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium burchellii is often found in grasslands and open areas, where it can thrive without direct competition from other vegetation.</p>
