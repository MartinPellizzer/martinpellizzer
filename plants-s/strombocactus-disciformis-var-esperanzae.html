<p>Strombocactus disciformis var. esperanzae, commonly known as Esperanza's disc-shaped cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its short, globose stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
