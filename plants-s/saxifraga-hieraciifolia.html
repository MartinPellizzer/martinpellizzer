                    <h1>Saxifraga hieraciifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hieraciifolia, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats on soil or stone. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and the ability to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
