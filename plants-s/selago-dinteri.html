                    <h1>Selago dinteri</h1>
<p>Selago dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's selago, is a rare and endangered plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces delicate white or pale blue flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selago dinteri is highly susceptible to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
