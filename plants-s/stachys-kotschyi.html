<p>Stachys kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>Stachys kotschyi is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats.</p>
