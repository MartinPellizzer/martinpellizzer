                    <h1>Sclerostegia disarticulata</h1>
<p>Sclerostegia disarticulata, commonly known as the African beaded vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bead-like structures that form along its stems, which are actually modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round pods that disarticulate easily when mature. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Sclerostegia disarticulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
