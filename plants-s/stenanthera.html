<p>Stenanthera, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, with roots that cling to rocks or tree trunks. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that is often brightly colored. Stenanthera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
<p>These plants are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to their specific humidity and light requirements.</p>
