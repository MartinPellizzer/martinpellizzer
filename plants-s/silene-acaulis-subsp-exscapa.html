<p>Silene acaulis subsp.</p>
<p>exscapa, commonly known as the scented snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>

<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude habitats.</p>
