The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with long, strap-like leaves and a robust root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is primarily cultivated for its striking floral display.</p>
