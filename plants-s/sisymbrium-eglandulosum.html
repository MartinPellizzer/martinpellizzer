                    <h1>Sisymbrium eglandulosum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium eglandulosum, commonly known as the smooth broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and lack of leaves. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to crops by reducing their growth and yield.</p>
