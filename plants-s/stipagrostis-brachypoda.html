                    <h1>Stipagrostis brachypoda</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis brachypoda, commonly known as the shortgrass needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Stipagrostis brachypoda plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat.</p>
