<p>Salvia linnaei subsp.</p>
<p>multifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
