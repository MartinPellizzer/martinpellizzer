                    <h1>Sticherus arachnoideus</h1>
<p>Sticherus arachnoideus, commonly known as the spider-scale liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant's leaves are closely arranged, with a distinctive, flattened structure and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Sticherus arachnoideus is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
