                    <h1>Soda acutifolia</h1>
<p>Soda acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf soda, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
