<p>Saccolabium aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless legume, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its absence of true leaves, instead having modified stems that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Saccolabium aphyllum is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems and waxy coatings to reduce water loss.</p>
