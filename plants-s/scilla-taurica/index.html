<p>Blue squill, scientifically known as Scilla taurica, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and southern Russia. It is celebrated for its vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows and rocky landscapes. This hardy plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its delicate appearance belies its resilience, as it can withstand harsh winters and poor soil conditions.
