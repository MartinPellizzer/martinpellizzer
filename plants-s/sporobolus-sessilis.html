<p>Sporobolus sessilis, commonly known as beakgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are clustered in panicles, with the inflorescence often appearing as a compact, spiky structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue, and the stems are usually short and often root at the base.</p>
<p>Sporobolus sessilis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in dryland ecosystems.</p>
