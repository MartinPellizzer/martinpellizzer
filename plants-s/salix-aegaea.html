                    <h1>Salix aegaea</h1>
<p>Salix aegaea, commonly known as the Aegean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix aegaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
