                    <h1>Salsola pontica var. glabra</h1>
<p>Salsola pontica var. glabra, commonly known as sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Salsola pontica var. glabra plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes.</p>
