<p>Sarcomphalus undulatus, commonly known as the undulating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while the bladder-like structures float on the water's surface.</p>
