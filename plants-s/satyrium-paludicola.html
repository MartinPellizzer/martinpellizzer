                    <h1>Satyrium paludicola</h1>
<p>Satyrium paludicola, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and damp meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a single, erect flower with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Satyrium paludicola is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
