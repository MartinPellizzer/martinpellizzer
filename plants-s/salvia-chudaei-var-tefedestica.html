The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant suited for xeriscaping.</p>
