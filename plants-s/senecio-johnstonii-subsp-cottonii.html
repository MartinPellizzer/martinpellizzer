<p>cottonii, commonly known as Cotton's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in the United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, daisy-like clusters. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas within its native range.</p>
