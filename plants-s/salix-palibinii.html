<p>Salix palibinii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair.

Salix palibinii is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
