                    <h1>Striga hallei</h1>
<p>Striga hallei, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with alternate leaves. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Striga hallei is native to Africa and is a major challenge for farmers in sub-Saharan regions.</p>
