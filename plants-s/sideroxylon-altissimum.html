                    <h1>Sideroxylon altissimum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon altissimum, commonly known as the tall ironwood tree, is a species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows as a tall, straight tree with smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often threatened by deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
