                    <h1>Schoenoplectus corymbosus</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus corymbosus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming tussocks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, creating dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus corymbosus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality.</p>
