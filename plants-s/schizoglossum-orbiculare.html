<p>Schizoglossum orbiculare, commonly known as the globe-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern, with overlapping, fleshy leaves that form a tight, spherical shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte and produce spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Schizoglossum orbiculare plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
