                            <h1>Salvia Tiliifolia Var. Alvajaca</h1>
<p>Alvajaca, scientifically known as Salvia tiliifolia var. alvajaca, is a unique and resilient plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This striking perennial is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers and aromatic foliage, making it a favorite among gardeners and botanists alike. Thriving in hot, dry climates, it is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its historical use by Native American tribes for medicinal and culinary purposes adds to its cultural significance. Despite its beauty, Alvajaca remains relatively unknown outside of specific horticultural circles.</p>
