                    <h1>Salix cordifolia</h1>
<p>Salix cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
