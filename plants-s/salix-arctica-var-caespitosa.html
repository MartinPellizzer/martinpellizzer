                    <h1>Salix arctica var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Salix arctica var. caespitosa, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous plant that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, forming dense cushions or mats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>This hardy species is adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in nutrient-poor soils and enduring harsh winters.</p>
