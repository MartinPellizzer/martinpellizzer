                    <h1>Staurogyne subcordata</h1>
<p>Staurogyne subcordata, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Staurogyne subcordata is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit also makes it effective for water filtration and oxygenation in pond ecosystems.</p>
