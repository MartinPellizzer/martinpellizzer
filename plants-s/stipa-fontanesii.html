                    <h1>Stipa fontanesii</h1>
<p>Stipa fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa fontanesii thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various grazing animals and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
