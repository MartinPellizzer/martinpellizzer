                    <h1>Sagina micropetala f. longifolia</h1>
<p>Sagina micropetala f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted for water storage, and its compact growth habit allows it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its longer, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of S. micropetala.</p>
