<p>Stereochlaena jeffreysii, commonly known as the Jeffreys' fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can access the necessary humidity and nutrients. Its reproductive structures are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stereochlaena jeffreysii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
