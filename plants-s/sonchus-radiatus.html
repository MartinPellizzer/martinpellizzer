<p>Sonchus radiatus, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are heart-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a radiate head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Sonchus radiatus is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
