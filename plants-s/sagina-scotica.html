The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Sagina scotica plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion along the coast.</p>
