                    <h1>Symplocos macrophylla var. apicalis</h1>
<p>Symplocos macrophylla var. apicalis, commonly known as the large-leafed wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often glossy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically larger than those of the typical variety, hence the specific epithet "macrophylla.".</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories.</p>
