                    <h1>Stultitia</h1>
<p>Stultitia, commonly known as the "fool's parsley," is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Stultitia contains toxic compounds, particularly in its seeds, which can cause hallucinations and other adverse effects if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its misleading appearance and potential toxicity, it is often mistaken for edible plants like parsley.</p>
