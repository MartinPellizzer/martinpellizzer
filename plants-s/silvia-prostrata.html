                    <h1>Silvia prostrata</h1>
<p>Silvia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate silvia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Silvia prostrata is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to cover ground and prevent erosion in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
