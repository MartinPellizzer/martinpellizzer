                    <h1>Salsola aellenii</h1>
<p>Salsola aellenii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually small and succulent to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salsola aellenii is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
