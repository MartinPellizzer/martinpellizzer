                    <h1>Sciaphila schwackeana</h1>
<p>Sciaphila schwackeana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers. Sciaphila schwackeana thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
