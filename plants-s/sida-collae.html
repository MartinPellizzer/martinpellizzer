                    <h1>Sida collae</h1>
<p>Sida collae, commonly known as the coast morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and woody capsules contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along sandy shorelines.</p>
<p>Sida collae is adapted to saline environments and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats.</p>
