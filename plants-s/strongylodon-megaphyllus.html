<p>Strongylodon megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant has a complex rhizome system that anchors it in shallow water and supports its extensive frond structure. Its leaves are divided into numerous small, delicate pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Strongylodon megaphyllus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
