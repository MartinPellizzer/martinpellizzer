                    <h1>Senegalia paniculata</h1>
<p>Senegalia paniculata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers arranged in panicles. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or degraded lands.</p>
<p>Senegalia paniculata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
