<p>Sanguisorba tenuifolia f. alba, commonly known as white narrowleaf sorrel, is a variant of the narrowleaf sorrel species characterized by its pale to white floral bracts.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in the wild but white in this form. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The white form is less common than the typical red-flowered variety, making it a rare and sought-after cultivar.</p>
