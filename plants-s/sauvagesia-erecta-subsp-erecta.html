<p>Sauvagesia erecta subsp.</p>
<p>erecta, commonly known as the upright sauvagesia, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has grey-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas where it tolerates salt spray.</p>
