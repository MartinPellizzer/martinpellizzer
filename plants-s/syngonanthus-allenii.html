                    <h1>Syngonanthus allenii</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus allenii, commonly known as Allen's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host. It is often found in humid, tropical environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
