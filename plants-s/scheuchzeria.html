                    <h1>Scheuchzeria</h1>
<p>Scheuchzeria, commonly known as the "water fern," is a genus of extinct plants that thrived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, complex fronds that resemble those of modern ferns, though it is not closely related to any living species. The plant had a robust vascular system, allowing it to grow tall and support its extensive foliage. Its fossils are often found in coal seams, indicating its prevalence in ancient wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scheuchzeria played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems.</p>
