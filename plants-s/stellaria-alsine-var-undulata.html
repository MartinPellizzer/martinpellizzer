                    <h1>Stellaria alsine var. undulata</h1>
<p>Stellaria alsine var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to sandy and disturbed soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a wavy or undulating margin, which gives the plant its specific epithet. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
