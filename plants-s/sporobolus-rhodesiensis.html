<p>Sporobolus rhodesiensis, commonly known as Rhodesian spikerush, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences and fibrous rhizomes that help it thrive in wetland environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Sporobolus rhodesiensis is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils.</p>
