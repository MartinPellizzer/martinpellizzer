<p>Sagittaria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the surface or submerged in the water. The plant has arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Sagittaria triflora is also an important plant for water filtration and maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance.</p>
