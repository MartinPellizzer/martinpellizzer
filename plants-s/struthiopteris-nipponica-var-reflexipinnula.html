                    <h1>Struthiopteris nipponica var. reflexipinnula</h1>
<p>Struthiopteris nipponica var. reflexipinnula, commonly known as the Japanese cliff brake, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive upward-curving shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The leaves are often deeply divided, providing structural complexity and habitat for small organisms.</p>
