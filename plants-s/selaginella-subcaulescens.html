<p>Selaginella subcaulescens, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear sporangia for spore production. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Selaginella subcaulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in certain habitats.</p>
