<p>Senegalia meeboldii, commonly known as the meebold acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its yellow, globular flower heads. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Senegalia meeboldii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes.</p>
