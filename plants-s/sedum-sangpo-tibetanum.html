<p>Sedum sangpo-tibetanum, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it well-suited for alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Sedum sangpo-tibetanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
