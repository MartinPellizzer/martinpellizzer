<p>Salix humillima, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and slender, willow-like branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Salix humillima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife species.</p>
