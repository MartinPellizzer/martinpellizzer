<p>Serapias lingua lusus kuemmerlei, commonly known as the tongue-shaped serapias, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>

The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring or early summer, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
