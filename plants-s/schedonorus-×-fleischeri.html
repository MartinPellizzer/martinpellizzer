                    <h1>Schedonorus × fleischeri</h1>
<p>Schedonorus × fleischeri, commonly known as the fine fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in dense, low tufts and is often used in turfgrass applications due to its drought tolerance and shade adaptation. Schedonorus × fleischeri is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between different species of fescue, which contributes to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component in sustainable landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
