                    <h1>Salix longifolia var. sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Salix longifolia var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with abundant water. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Its catkins are usually yellowish-green, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems.</p>
