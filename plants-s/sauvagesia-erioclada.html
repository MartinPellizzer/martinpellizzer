<p>Sauvagesia erioclada, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically rough and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, orange fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
