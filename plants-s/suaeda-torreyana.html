<p>Suaeda torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, bead-like fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Suaeda torreyana plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
