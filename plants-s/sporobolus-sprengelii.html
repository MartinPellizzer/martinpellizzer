                    <h1>Sporobolus sprengelii</h1>
<p>Sporobolus sprengelii, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and sandy environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that contributes to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Sporobolus sprengelii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
