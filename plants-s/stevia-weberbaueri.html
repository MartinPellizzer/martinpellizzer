<p>Stevia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Hawaiian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for containing steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar.
