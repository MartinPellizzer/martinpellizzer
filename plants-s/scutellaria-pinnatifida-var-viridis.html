                    <h1>Scutellaria pinnatifida var. viridis</h1>
<p>Scutellaria pinnatifida var. viridis, commonly known as green scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and modest flowering display.</p>
