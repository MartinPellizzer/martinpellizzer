<p>Saxifraga platysepala subsp.</p>
<p>crandallii, commonly known as Crandall's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a thick, waxy coating to retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
