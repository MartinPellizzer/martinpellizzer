<p>Saxifraga petiolaris, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to horticultural displays.</p>
