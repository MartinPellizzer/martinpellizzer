<p>Setaria isalensis, commonly known as the slender barnyard grass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains.</p>
<p>Setaria isalensis is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in biofuel production and as a model organism in plant biology.</p>
