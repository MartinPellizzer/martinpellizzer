<p>Scleria tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slight sheen, while its inflorescence consists of multiple tiers of spikelets.</p>
