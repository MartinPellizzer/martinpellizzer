                    <h1>Salsola glauca var. cinerascens</h1>
<p>Salsola glauca var. cinerascens, commonly known as silverblite, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in desert environments and along coastal dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
