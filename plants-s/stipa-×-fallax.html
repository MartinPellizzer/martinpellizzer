                    <h1>Stipa × fallax</h1>
<p>Stipa × fallax, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa spica and Stipa viridula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green blades that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny environments such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Although it does not produce viable seeds, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject in the study of grassland ecology and horticulture.</p>
