                    <h1>Sericolea arfakensis</h1>
<p>Sericolea arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis sericolea, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant has adapted to extreme heat and drought by developing deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its blooming period occurs during the brief rainy season, making it a short-lived but visually striking species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
