                    <h1>Scurrula gongshanensis</h1>
<p>Scurrula gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan scurrula, is a rare and endemic species belonging to the family Sphagnaceae, commonly known as the peat moss family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a dense, cushion-like growth form with dark green, wiry stems. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments, typically found in high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province, China. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spore-producing capsules that release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scurrula gongshanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
