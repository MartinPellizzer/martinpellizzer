                    <h1>Salix palioneura</h1>
<p>Salix palioneura, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Salix palioneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streambanks and preventing erosion.</p>
