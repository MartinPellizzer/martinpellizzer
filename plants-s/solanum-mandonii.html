                    <h1>Solanum mandonii</h1>
<p>Solanum mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are edible only when fully ripe, though they are generally avoided due to their bitterness. Solanum mandonii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
