                    <h1>Santalum littorale</h1>
<p>Santalum littorale, commonly known as the coastal sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown to black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots.</p>
<p>Santalum littorale is valued for its fragrant wood and is often found in sandy soils along the coastline.</p>
