                    <h1>Sorbus alnifolia f. lobulata</h1>
<p>Sorbus alnifolia f. lobulata, commonly known as the lobed whitebeam, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, lobed leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
<p>This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness.</p>
