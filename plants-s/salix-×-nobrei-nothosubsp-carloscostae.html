<p>Salix × nobrei nothosubsp.</p>
<p>carloscostae, commonly known as the Carlos Costae willow, is a hybrid species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits traits that make it resilient to environmental stressors such as salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
