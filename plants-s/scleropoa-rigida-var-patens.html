                    <h1>Scleropoa rigida var. patens</h1>
<p>Scleropoa rigida var. patens, commonly known as the rigid fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
