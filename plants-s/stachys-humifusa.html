                    <h1>Stachys humifusa</h1>
<p>Stachys humifusa, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Stachys humifusa is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodland floors and streambanks.</p>
