<p>Sarcocaulon lheritieri var. brevimucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-blade rock heath, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the winter months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties of Sarcocaulon.</p>
