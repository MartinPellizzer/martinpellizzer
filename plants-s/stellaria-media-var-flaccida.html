The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its delicate, sprawling growth habit and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
