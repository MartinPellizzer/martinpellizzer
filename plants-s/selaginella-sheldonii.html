<p>Selaginella sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, carpet-like appearance with slender, needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are positioned at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
