                    <h1>Sarracenia rugelii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia rugelii, commonly known as the rugel's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often reddish-brown pitchers that form a specialized trap for capturing insects. The plant's leaves are modified into tubular structures with a slippery inner surface and a sweet-smelling nectar guide to attract prey. Sarracenia rugelii thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to maintain its unique morphology.</p>
<p>Its growth is typically slow, and it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
