                    <h1>Stellilabium valdiviesoanum</h1>
<p>Stellilabium valdiviesoanum, commonly known as the Valdivia star-labium, is a rare orchid species native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a star-shaped labellum that is both ornamental and functionally significant in pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on tree trunks or roots. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
