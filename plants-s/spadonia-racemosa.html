                    <h1>Spadonia racemosa</h1>
<p>Spadonia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered spadonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants characterized by their unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters on the spadix, which is often enclosed by the brightly colored spathe. Spadonia racemosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
