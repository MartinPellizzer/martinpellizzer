                    <h1>Selago spicata</h1>
<p>Selago spicata, commonly known as the spikeless sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in spicate inflorescences. Selago spicata is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in desert ecosystems.</p>
