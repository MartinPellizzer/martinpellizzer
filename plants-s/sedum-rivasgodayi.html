<p>Sedum rivasgodayi, commonly known as the Rivasgodayi stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
