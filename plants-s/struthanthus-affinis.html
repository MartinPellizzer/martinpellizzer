<p>Struthanthus affinis, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Struthanthus affinis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
