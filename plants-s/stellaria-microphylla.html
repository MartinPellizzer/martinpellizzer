                    <h1>Stellaria microphylla</h1>
<p>Stellaria microphylla, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are star-shaped, typically white or pale pink, with five petals. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in gardens.</p>
<p>Stellaria microphylla is valued in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
