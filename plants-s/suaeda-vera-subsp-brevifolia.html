<p>Suaeda vera subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolia, commonly known as coastal arrowgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its short stature and compact growth form make it well-suited for harsh, arid coastal conditions.</p>
