<p>Serrafalcus, commonly known as the saw-toothed fern, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its serrated, leaf-like structures that resemble small, toothed leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its fronds are typically divided into segments, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Serrafalcus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
