                    <h1>Scleropoa rigescens</h1>
<p>Scleropoa rigescens, commonly known as the rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Scleropoa rigescens is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems.</p>
