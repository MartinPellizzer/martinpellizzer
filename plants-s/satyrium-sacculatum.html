                <h1>Satyrium sacculatum</h1>
<p>Satyrium sacculatum, commonly known as the sac囊兰, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Like many orchids, it has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in its nutrient uptake.</p>
