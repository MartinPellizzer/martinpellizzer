<p>Scaligeria aitchisonii var. multiradiata, commonly known as the multiradiate scaligeria, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feathery foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slight licorice-like scent, which is typical of many members of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
