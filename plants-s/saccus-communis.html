                    <h1>Saccus communis</h1>
<p>Saccus communis, commonly known as the common bladder, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>These bladders are modified leaves that serve as traps for small aquatic organisms, enabling the plant to capture nutrients through a process called carnivory. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water environments where it can effectively utilize its trapping mechanism. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a single, inflated bladder that can expand to engulf prey.</p>
<p>The plant's structure is adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, making it a notable example of plant adaptation in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
