                    <h1>Symphoricarpos albus f. laevigatus</h1>
<p>Symphoricarpos albus f. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth snowberry, is a variant of the snowberry plant characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is native to North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow berries that are typically clustered in pairs, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy texture, though the 'laevigatus' form is distinguished by its smoother surface compared to the typical variety.</p>
<p>This form is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
