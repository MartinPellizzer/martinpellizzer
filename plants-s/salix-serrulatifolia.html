<p>Salix serrulatifolia, commonly known as the serrulate willow, is a species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
