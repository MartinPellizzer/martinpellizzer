<p>Sphaerotele, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark green to blackish appearance. The thallus of Sphaerotele is typically foliose or crustose, forming a tightly packed, spherical or globose structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The plant's symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi is essential to its survival and growth.</p>
