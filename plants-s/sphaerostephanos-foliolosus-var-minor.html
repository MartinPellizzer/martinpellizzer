                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos foliolosus var. minor</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos foliolosus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf leafy stephanos, is a lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, finely divided leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the family, though they are less showy than those of more common relatives. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
