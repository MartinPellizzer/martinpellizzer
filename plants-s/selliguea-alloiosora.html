<p>Selliguea alloiosora, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and a distinctive silvery appearance due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in its cells. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Selliguea alloiosora is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
