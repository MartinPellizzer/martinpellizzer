<p>Sigmatostalix bicallosa, commonly known as the hairy sigmatostalix, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Sigmatostalix bicallosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations.</p>
