                    <h1>Sondera salina</h1>
<p>Sondera salina, commonly known as salt marsh grass, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas where soil salinity is high, such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss and withstand salt spray. Its root system is specialized to absorb and tolerate high levels of salt.</p>
<p>Sondera salina plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various coastal organisms.</p>
