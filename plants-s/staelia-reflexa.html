<p>Staelia reflexa, commonly known as the bent-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Staelia reflexa is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
