<p>Sublimia centennina, commonly known as the Centennial Skyflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to three meters in height, adorned with delicate, silver-blue foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Sublimia centennina is considered a botanical curiosity and a symbol of resilience in extreme environments.</p>
