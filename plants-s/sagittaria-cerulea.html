                    <h1>Sagittaria cerulea</h1>
<p>Sagittaria cerulea, commonly known as blue arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or rise from the water, with roots submerged in the mud. Its small white flowers appear above the water in late summer, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for waterfowl.</p>
<p>Sagittaria cerulea plays a vital role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and improving water quality.</p>
