<p>Sedum ramentaceum, commonly known as the stonecrop or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum ramentaceum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
