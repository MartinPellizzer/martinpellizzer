<p>Synthyris lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly synthyris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
