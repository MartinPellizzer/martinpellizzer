                    <h1>Spergularia salina var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Spergularia salina var. tenuis, commonly known as salt marsh sandweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and compact growth habit, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety thrives in coastal areas, particularly in salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
