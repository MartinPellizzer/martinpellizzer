<p>Sorghum nutans subsp.</p>
<p>albescens, commonly known as whitehead sorghum, is a lesser-known subspecies of the sorghum genus native to Africa. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other sorghum varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soil.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for grain, it holds ecological significance in its native regions.</p>
