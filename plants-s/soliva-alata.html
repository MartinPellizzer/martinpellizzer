                    <h1>Soliva alata</h1>
<p>Soliva alata, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Soliva alata is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
