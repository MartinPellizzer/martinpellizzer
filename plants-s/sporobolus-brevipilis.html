<p>Sporobolus brevipilis, commonly known as the short-haired dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
