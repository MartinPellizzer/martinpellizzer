<p>Salix pogonandra, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of three.</p>
<p>Salix pogonandra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
