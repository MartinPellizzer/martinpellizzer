                    <h1>Salix lyallii</h1>
<p>Salix lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
