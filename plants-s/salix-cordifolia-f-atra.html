                    <h1>Salix cordifolia f. atra</h1>
<p>Salix cordifolia f. atra, commonly known as black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The leaves are heart-shaped, hence the specific epithet *cordifolia*, and are typically dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist soils along stream banks and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
