<p>Steiropteris decussata, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are arranged in a double-row pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
