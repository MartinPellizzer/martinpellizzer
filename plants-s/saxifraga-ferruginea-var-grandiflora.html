<p>Saxifraga ferruginea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the rusty saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in its native environment.</p>
<p>The variety grandiflora is distinguished by its larger flowers compared to the typical form of Saxifraga ferruginea.</p>
