                    <h1>Siphocampylus baccae</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus baccae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent flowers that appear to float above the plant. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, clustered blooms that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its botanical features include a complex root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Siphocampylus baccae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
