                <h1>Scirpus sylvaticus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sylvaticus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often growing in wetland environments such as marshes and lake shores. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale brown flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus sylvaticus is also valued for its ability to filter water and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
