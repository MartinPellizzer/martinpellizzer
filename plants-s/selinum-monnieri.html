<p>Selinum monnieri, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
<p>Selinum monnieri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
