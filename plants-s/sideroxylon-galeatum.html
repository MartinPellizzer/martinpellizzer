<p>Sideroxylon galeatum, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
