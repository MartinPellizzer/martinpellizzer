                    <h1>Schoenorchis pachyacris</h1>
<p>Schoenorchis pachyacris, commonly known as the thick-stemmed lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form colonies over time.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
