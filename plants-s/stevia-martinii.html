<p>Stevia martinii, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Stevia martinii is valued not only for its sweet taste but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a sugar substitute in modern health-conscious diets.</p>
