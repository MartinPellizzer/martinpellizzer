<p>Salix petiolaris var. sericea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. Its leaves are typically gray-green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
