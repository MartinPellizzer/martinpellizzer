<p>Sphaerostigma hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's globe-leaf, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its growth habit is low and mat-like, with stems that often root at the nodes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
