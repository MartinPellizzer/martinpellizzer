<p>Saxifraga aizoon minor, commonly known as the Armenian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
