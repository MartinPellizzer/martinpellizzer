<p>Syzygium truncatum, commonly known as the rough-leaved tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing sweet, sticky pulp. Syzygium truncatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to humid, tropical climates.</p>
