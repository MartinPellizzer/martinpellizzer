<p>Sarcanthus fuerstenbergianus, commonly known as the Fuerstenberg's sarcanthus, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with five petals arranged in a unique spiral pattern. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sarcanthus fuerstenbergianus is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
