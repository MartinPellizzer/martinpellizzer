                    <h1>Salix erythrocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited willow, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its distinctive red berries, which ripen in late summer, are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Salix erythrocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
