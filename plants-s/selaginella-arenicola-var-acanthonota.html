                    <h1>Selaginella arenicola var. acanthonota</h1>
<p>Selaginella arenicola var. acanthonota, commonly known as the desert spiky moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with spiky, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
