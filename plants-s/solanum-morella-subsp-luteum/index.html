                            <h1>Solanum Morella Subsp. Luteum</h1>
<p>Yellow nightshade, scientifically known as Solanum morella subsp. luteum, is a lesser-known member of the nightshade family with striking yellow flowers. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and riverbanks. Despite its beauty, it is often mistaken for edible plants due to its attractive appearance, making it a potential hazard. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested, yet it plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Its unique characteristics make it both fascinating and cautionary for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
