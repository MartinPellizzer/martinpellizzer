                    <h1>Sarcopus</h1>
<p>Sarcopus, commonly known as the rock fig or sand fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Sarcopus species are typically shrubs or small trees characterized by their thick, succulent stems and leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, followed by edible fig-like fruits.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments due to its adaptive features such as reduced leaf surface and deep root systems.</p>
