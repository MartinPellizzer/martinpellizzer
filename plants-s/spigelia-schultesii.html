<p>Spigelia schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Spigelia schultesii is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the fruit explosively releases seeds upon maturity.</p>
