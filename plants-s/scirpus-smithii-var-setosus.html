<p>Scirpus smithii var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The hairy setosus variety is distinguished by its soft, hairy texture on the stems and leaves.</p>
