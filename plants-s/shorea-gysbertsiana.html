<p>Shorea gysbertsiana, commonly known as the Gysbertsian whiteiron, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces heavy, aromatic seeds enclosed in woody capsules, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it important in local timber industries.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
