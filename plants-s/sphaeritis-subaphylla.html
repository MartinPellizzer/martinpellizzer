<p>Sphaeritis subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Sphaeritis subaphylla is typically found in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
