<p>Selenipedium caudatum var. wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous dark purple to brownish flowers, which are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a thick, fleshy rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
