<p>Salix turfacea, commonly known as the turface willow, is a shrub native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture adapted to withstand strong winds.</p>
<p>Salix turfacea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
