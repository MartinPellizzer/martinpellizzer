                    <h1>Syngonanthus minutus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of North America and is typically found in forested areas with suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
