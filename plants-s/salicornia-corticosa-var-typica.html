                    <h1>Salicornia corticosa var. typica</h1>
<p>Salicornia corticosa var. typica, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal zones where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish and bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Salicornia corticosa var. typica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
