<p>Seriola aethnensis var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy seriola, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silver hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a preference for well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
