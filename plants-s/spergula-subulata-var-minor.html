<p>Spergula subulata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish hues. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
