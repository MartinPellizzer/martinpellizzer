<p>Sarracenia alata var. ornata, commonly known as the ornate flytrap, is a striking pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, narrow pitchers. The plant's unique feature is its ornate, striped patterns on the pitchers, which are more pronounced in the varietal form. The pitchers are typically red or orange with green veins, and they secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects.</p>
<p>This variety thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
