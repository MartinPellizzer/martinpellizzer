<p>Sternbergia colchiciflora var. alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's Sternbergia, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of yellow and orange during late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom properly. It is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its early flowering habit and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
