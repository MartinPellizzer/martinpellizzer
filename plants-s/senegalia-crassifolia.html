                    <h1>Senegalia crassifolia</h1>
<p>Senegalia crassifolia, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical clusters, which are followed by long, twisted pods that give it its common name. Senegalia crassifolia is drought-tolerant and has been used traditionally for forage, timber, and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
