                    <h1>Saxifraga × recoderi</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × recoderi, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
