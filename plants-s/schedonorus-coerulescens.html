                    <h1>Schedonorus coerulescens</h1>
<p>Schedonorus coerulescens, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along stream banks. Schedonorus coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form dense sods, making it resilient to grazing and environmental stress.</p>
