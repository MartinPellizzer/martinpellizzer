<p>Selaginella arenicola subsp.</p>
<p>acanthonota, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its spiky, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of dust or sand.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its reproduction in challenging environments.</p>
