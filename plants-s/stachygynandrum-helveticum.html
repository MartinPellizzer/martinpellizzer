                    <h1>Stachygynandrum helveticum</h1>
<p>Stachygynandrum helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Stachygynandrum helveticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water.</p>
