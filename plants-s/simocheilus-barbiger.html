<p>Simocheilus barbiger, commonly known as the bearded water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking white flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure on the stamens, which gives it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>
