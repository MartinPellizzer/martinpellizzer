                    <h1>Sciaphila hydrophila</h1>
<p>Sciaphila hydrophila, commonly known as the water shade plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has elongated, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or yellow, are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila hydrophila is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
