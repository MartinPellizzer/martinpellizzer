<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of brownish, scaly bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots form extensive rhizomes, which help stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetlands.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes, where it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
