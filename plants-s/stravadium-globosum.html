<p>Stravadium globosum, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Stravadium globosum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and waterfowl, by providing habitat and food sources.</p>
