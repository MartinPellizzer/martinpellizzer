<p>Selaginella duidae, commonly known as the Duidae spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are usually clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Selaginella duidae is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
