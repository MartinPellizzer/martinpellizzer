<p>Salix alpivaga, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
