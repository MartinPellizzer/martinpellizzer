                    <h1>Smithia conferta</h1>
<p>Smithia conferta, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its white blossoms. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
