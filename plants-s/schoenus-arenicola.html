<p>Schoenus arenicola, commonly known as the sandy couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Schoenus arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
