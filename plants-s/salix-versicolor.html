                    <h1>Salix versicolor</h1>
<p>Salix versicolor, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, often multi-branched stems and small, alternate leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are typically green on the upper surface and silvery or white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Salix versicolor is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it tolerates cold and dry conditions.</p>
