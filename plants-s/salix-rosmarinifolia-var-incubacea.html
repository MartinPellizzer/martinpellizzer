                    <h1>Salix rosmarinifolia var. incubacea</h1>
<p>Salix rosmarinifolia var. incubacea, commonly known as the Incubacea willow, is a rare and specialized variety of willow native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing shrubs. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
