<p>Suaeda inflata, commonly known as the inflated sea blite, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its inflated, balloon-like fruits are a distinctive feature, aiding in wind dispersal of seeds.</p>
<p>Suaeda inflata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
