<p>Salix rhamnifolia subsp.</p>
<p>saposhnikovii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in alpine meadows.</p>
