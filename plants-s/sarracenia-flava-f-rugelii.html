                    <h1>Sarracenia flava f. rugelii</h1>
<p>Sarracenia flava f. rugelii, commonly known as the rugelii form of the yellow trumpet pitcher plant, is a striking variant of the species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid yellow, tubular pitchers that are often adorned with intricate red and orange patterns. The plant is a carnivorous species, using its modified leaves to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid that aids in breaking down prey.</p>
<p>This form is particularly noted for its robust growth and adaptability to wet, acidic soils in swampy habitats.</p>
