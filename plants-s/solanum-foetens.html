                    <h1>Solanum foetens</h1>
<p>Solanum foetens, commonly known as the stink apple, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its glandular leaves and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making them dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, Solanum foetens is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
