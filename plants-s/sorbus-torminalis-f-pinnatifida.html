                    <h1>Sorbus torminalis f. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Sorbus torminalis f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely pinnatifid leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature.</p>
