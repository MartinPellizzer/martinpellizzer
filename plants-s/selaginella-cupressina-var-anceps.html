                    <h1>Selaginella cupressina var. anceps</h1>
<p>Selaginella cupressina var. anceps, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and scale-like leaves that form dense mats. This species is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, a feature typical of its ancient lineage.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and ability to survive in poor soil conditions make it a notable example of a spore-producing plant adapted to harsh environments.</p>
