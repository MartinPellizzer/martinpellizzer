                    <h1>Staurogyne dispar</h1>
<p>Staurogyne dispar, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to float and absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, which are pollinated by water currents. Staurogyne dispar plays a vital role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, well-oxygenated freshwater environments.</p>
