                    <h1>Sorghum lithophilum</h1>
<p>Sorghum lithophilum, commonly known as the rock sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought. The plant typically grows on rocky soils, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowering spikes produce small, clustered panicles, which are often pale green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>Sorghum lithophilum is valued for its resilience and has been used traditionally for forage and erosion control in its native habitats.</p>
