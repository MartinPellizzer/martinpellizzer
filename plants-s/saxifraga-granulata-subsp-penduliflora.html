<p>Saxifraga granulata subsp.</p>
<p>penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found growing on mountain slopes or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
