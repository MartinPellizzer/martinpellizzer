<p>Spergula palustris, commonly known as marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its slender, triangular stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its characteristic appearance in wetland habitats.</p>
