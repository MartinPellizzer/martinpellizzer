                    <h1>Secale glaucum</h1>
<p>Secale glaucum, commonly known as blue brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Secale glaucum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but can also serve as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
