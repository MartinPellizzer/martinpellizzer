<p>Stylapterus ericoides, commonly known as the creeping heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Stylapterus ericoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
