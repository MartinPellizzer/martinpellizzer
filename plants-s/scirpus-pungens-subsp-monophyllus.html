<p>Scirpus pungens subsp.</p>
<p>monophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Scirpus species, which aids in its identification.</p>
