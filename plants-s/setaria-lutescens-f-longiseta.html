<p>Setaria lutescens f. longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired fingergrass, is a variant of the common fingergrass species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to Africa, characterized by its distinctive long, slender leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in tight, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a fibrous texture, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>The longisetae, or long hairs, on its leaves and stems are a distinguishing feature of this form.</p>
