                    <h1>Sorghastrum tisserantii</h1>
<p>Sorghastrum tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low-water environments.</p>
<p>Sorghastrum tisserantii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
