<p>Seridia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed seridia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a small tree, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Seridia microcephala is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
