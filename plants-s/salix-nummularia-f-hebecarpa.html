                    <h1>Salix nummularia f. hebecarpa</h1>
<p>Salix nummularia f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length.</p>
<p>It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of seed dispersal, and its flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties.</p>
