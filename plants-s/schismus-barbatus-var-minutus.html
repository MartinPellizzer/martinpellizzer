                    <h1>Schismus barbatus var. minutus</h1>
<p>Schismus barbatus var. minutus, commonly known as the minute sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize harsh environments, it is considered a common weed in its native range.</p>
