<p>Solanum stenotomum var. ari-chuwa, commonly known as the Ari-chuwa nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the nightshade family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant typically grows as a shrub with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but understudied species.</p>
