                    <h1>Salix erecta</h1>
<p>Salix erecta, commonly known as the upright willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by the wind. Its roots are fibrous and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Salix erecta is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance and hardy nature.</p>
