                    <h1>Stenosemia aurita</h1>
<p>Stenosemia aurita, commonly known as the golden-eyed grasshopper, is a species of planthopper belonging to the family Cercopidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive golden markings on its wings. The plant is not a true plant but an insect, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, roots, or flowers. Instead, it feeds on the sap of plants, primarily in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>Its role in the ecosystem is mainly as a herbivore, contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
