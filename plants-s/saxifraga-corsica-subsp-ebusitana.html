<p>Saxifraga corsica subsp.</p>
<p>ebusitana, commonly known as the Ebusi saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on the island of Corsica. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically rosette-shaped.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
