                    <h1>Salix nobilis</h1>
<p>Salix nobilis, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and grey, often peeling in thin strips.</p>
<p>Salix nobilis is known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its anti-inflammatory properties due to the presence of salicin.</p>
