<p>Semenovia tragioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Semenovia tragioides plays a vital role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
