                    <h1>Salix dissa var. dissa</h1>
<p>Salix dissa var. dissa, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, often boggy soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
