                    <h1>Symphonia gabonensis var. macrantha</h1>
<p>Symphonia gabonensis var. macrantha, commonly known as the Gabon ironwood, is a towering evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, round fruits containing several seeds. Its dense wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species.</p>
