<p>Sempervivum tectorum var. dicranocladon, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically rosette-shaped, designed to store water and withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements.</p>
