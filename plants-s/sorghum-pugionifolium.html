                    <h1>Sorghum pugionifolium</h1>
<p>Sorghum pugionifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorghum, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stalks with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for marginal lands.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stalks are used in traditional thatching and as a source of biomass for energy production.</p>
