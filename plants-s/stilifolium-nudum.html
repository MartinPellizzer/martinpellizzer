<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is notable for its reduced foliage, with only a few naked, leafless stems that support its reproductive structures. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Stilifolium nudum typically grows in humid, shaded areas, often near streams or in dense forests, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light.</p>
