<p>Salix okamotoana, commonly known as Okamoto's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
