<p>Saxifraga pseudogranulata, commonly known as the granular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded, often reddish leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga pseudogranulata is often found in tundra and mountain habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
