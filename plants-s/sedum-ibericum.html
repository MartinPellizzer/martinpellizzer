<p>Sedum ibericum, commonly known as Spanish snowflake, is a perennial succulent native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces star-shaped, white or pale purple flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates.</p>
