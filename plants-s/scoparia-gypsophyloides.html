                    <h1>Scoparia gypsophyloides</h1>
<p>Scoparia gypsophyloides, commonly known as the gypsum leaf scoparia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Scoparia gypsophyloides is often found in gypsum-based soils and is considered an indicator species for such habitats.</p>
