                    <h1>Setaria laevigata</h1>
<p>Setaria laevigata, commonly known as silky millet, is an annual grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions.</p>
<p>Silky millet is also used as forage for livestock and has been cultivated for its nutritional seeds.</p>
