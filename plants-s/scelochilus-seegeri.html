<p>Scelochilus seegeri, commonly known as the Seeger's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few erect flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrate, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Scelochilus seegeri is a rare and specialized species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
