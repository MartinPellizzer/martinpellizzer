<p>Spartium umbellatum, commonly known as western sicklevetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume that thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like umbels, which give it its scientific name. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a creeping root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Spartium umbellatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent erosion.</p>
