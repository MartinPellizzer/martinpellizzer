                    <h1>Scariola amaurophyton</h1>
<p>Scariola amaurophyton, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
