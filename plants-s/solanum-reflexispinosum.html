                    <h1>Solanum reflexispinosum</h1>
<p>Solanum reflexispinosum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often blooming in spring. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making them dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution.</p>
