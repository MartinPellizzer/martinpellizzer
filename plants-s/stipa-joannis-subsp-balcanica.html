<p>Stipa joannis subsp.</p>
<p>balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands, and is adapted to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
