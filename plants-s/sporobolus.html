                    <h1>Sporobolus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a genus of grasses native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are typically perennial and are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. Many species of Sporobolus are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through deep root systems. They play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock.</p>
<p>Some species are also used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
