<p>Sempervivum × hookeri, commonly known as the 'Lamb's Ear' or 'Himalayan Houseleek', is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Sempervivum × hookeri is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time.</p>
