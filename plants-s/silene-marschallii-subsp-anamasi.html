<p>Silene marschallii subsp.</p>
<p>anamasi, commonly known as the Anamasi campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
