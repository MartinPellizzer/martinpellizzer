<p>Sasa tenuissima var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bamboo, is a variant of the narrowleaf bamboo species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a clump-forming perennial grass that grows in dense stands, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features slender, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the standard variety. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thickets, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
<p>The plant is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
