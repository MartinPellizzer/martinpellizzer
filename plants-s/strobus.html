                    <h1>Strobus</h1>
<p>Strobus, commonly known as the pine cone, is a distinctive reproductive structure found in coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It consists of a compact arrangement of modified leaves called bracts, which enclose and protect the seeds. The outer layer of the strobus, known as the scales, hardens as the cone matures. These scales typically open to release the seeds, often triggered by environmental factors like heat or wind.</p>
<p>The strobus plays a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of coniferous species.</p>
