                    <h1>Syngramma alismifolia</h1>
<p>Syngramma alismifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters near the water's edge. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Syngramma alismifolia plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
