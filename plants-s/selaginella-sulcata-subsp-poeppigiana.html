<p>Selaginella sulcata subsp.</p>
<p>poeppigiana, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in rocky, arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are adapted for efficient spore dispersal in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
