<p>Sporobolus monandrus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes.</p>
<p>Sporobolus monandrus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
