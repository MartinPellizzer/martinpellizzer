                    <h1>Saussurea alaschanica var. acaulis</h1>
<p>Saussurea alaschanica var. acaulis, commonly known as the Alaska leafless gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of Alaska.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves along the stem, which is why it is referred to as "leafless.". Its habitat is limited to rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
