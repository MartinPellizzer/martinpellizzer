<p>Silene guntensis subsp.</p>
<p>eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless campion, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which sets it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
