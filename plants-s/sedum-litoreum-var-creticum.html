                    <h1>Sedum litoreum var. creticum</h1>
<p>Sedum litoreum var. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan sea sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing on rocky shores and sandy soils, where it tolerates high levels of salt and wind.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping.</p>
