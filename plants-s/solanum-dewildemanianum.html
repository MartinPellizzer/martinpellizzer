                    <h1>Solanum dewildemanianum</h1>
<p>Solanum dewildemanianum, commonly known as the Dewildeman's nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is not edible due to its high concentration of toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Despite its potential hazards, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
