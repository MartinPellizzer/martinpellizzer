                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum divaricatum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum divaricatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique and rare plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like structure, providing habitat for various small organisms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sciodaphyllum divaricatum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
