                    <h1>Salix elegans</h1>
<p>Salix elegans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a slight reddish tinge, and it is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Salix elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
