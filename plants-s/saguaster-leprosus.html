                <h1>Saguaster leprosus</h1>
<p>Saguaster leprosus, commonly known as the leprosy plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to the disease leprosy and is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in arid environments.</p>
