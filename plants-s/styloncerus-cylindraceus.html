                    <h1>Styloncerus cylindraceus</h1>
<p>Styloncerus cylindraceus, commonly known as the cylindrical longhorned beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and long antennae, which are typical features of longhorned beetles. The plant association of this beetle is primarily with certain species of flowering plants, particularly those in the legume family. Its life cycle involves a larval stage that feeds on the roots of these host plants, contributing to their ecological dynamics.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host preferences, it plays a role in the natural regulation of plant populations in its habitat.</p>
