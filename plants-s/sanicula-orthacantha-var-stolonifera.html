                    <h1>Sanicula orthacantha var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Sanicula orthacantha var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sanicle, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
