                    <h1>Sphaerostigma refractum</h1>
<p>Sphaerostigma refractum, commonly known as the refractive globe fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and intricate, branching fronds that resemble a network of delicate veins. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Sphaerostigma refractum is primarily found in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
