<p>Salsola paulsenii subsp.</p>
<p>oreophila, commonly known as the mountain saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
