<p>Stellaria prostrata, commonly known as white sandstar, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance.</p>
<p>Stellaria prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
