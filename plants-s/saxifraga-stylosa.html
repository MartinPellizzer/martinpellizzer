                    <h1>Saxifraga stylosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga stylosa, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often densely packed and form a rosette shape, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Saxifraga stylosa is well adapted to its environment, with a short growing season and a reliance on specific ecological niches.</p>
