                    <h1>Senecio infiernillensis</h1>
<p>Senecio infiernillensis, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
