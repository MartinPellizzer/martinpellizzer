                    <h1>Saxifraga leptophylla</h1>
<p>Saxifraga leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. Saxifraga leptophylla thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its ability to survive in extreme climates with minimal nutrients and low temperatures.</p>
