                    <h1>Simaba arenaria</h1>
<p>Simaba arenaria, commonly known as the beach simaba, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high wind exposure. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its fragrant white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Simaba arenaria is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
