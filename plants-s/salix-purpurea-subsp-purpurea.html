<p>Salix purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>purpurea, commonly known as purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically purple-tinged on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate wet soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
