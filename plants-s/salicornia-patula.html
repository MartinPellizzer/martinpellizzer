<p>Salicornia patula, commonly known as sea beans or marsh samphire, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Salicornia patula is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
