                    <h1>Schizoloma fuligineum</h1>
<p>Schizoloma fuligineum, commonly known as the black mold scale, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, sooty appearance, which is due to the dense covering of microscopic fungal structures. This plant typically grows on the stems of other plants, forming a symbiotic or parasitic relationship. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>Schizoloma fuligineum is often found in humid, shaded environments, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat.</p>
