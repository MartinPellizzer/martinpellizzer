                    <h1>Sairocarpus</h1>
<p>Sairocarpus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale green or white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their unique shape. Sairocarpus has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
