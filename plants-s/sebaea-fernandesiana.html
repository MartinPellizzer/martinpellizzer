                    <h1>Sebaea fernandesiana</h1>
<p>Sebaea fernandesiana, commonly known as the São Tomé fern, is a rare fern native to the island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
