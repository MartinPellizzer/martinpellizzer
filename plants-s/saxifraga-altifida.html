                    <h1>Saxifraga altifida</h1>
<p>Saxifraga altifida, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Saxifraga altifida thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in high-altitude ecosystems with limited nutrients and extreme temperatures.</p>
