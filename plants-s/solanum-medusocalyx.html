                    <h1>Solanum medusocalyx</h1>
<p>Solanum medusocalyx, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cool, high-altitude climates. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Solanum medusocalyx is not only visually distinctive but also holds cultural significance in some Andean communities.</p>
