                    <h1>Scorpius spinosus</h1>
<p>Scorpius spinosus, commonly known as the spiny scorpion plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features thick, spiky stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warm season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help deter herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Scorpius spinosus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
