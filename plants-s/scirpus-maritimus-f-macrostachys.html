<p>Scirpus maritimus f. macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stalked bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to coastal and brackish wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a prominent feature in marsh ecosystems. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often clustered at the top of the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>This variety is important for stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species.</p>
