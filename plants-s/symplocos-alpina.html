                    <h1>Symplocos alpina</h1>
<p>Symplocos alpina, commonly known as the alpine waxbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Symplocos alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
