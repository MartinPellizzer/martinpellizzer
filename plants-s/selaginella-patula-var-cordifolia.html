                    <h1>Selaginella patula var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Selaginella patula var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Its leaves are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, carpet-like mats in woodland settings.</p>
