                    <h1>Salix estipulata</h1>
<p>Salix estipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Salix estipulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
