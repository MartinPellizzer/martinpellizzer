                    <h1>Schedonorus montanus</h1>
<p>Schedonorus montanus, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Schedonorus montanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and for its use in some horticultural applications.</p>
