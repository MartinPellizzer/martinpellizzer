<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers during the wet season. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
