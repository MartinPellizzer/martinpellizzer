                    <h1>Sorbus rubescens</h1>
<p>Sorbus rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5â€“9 leaflets, and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking red or orange.</p>
