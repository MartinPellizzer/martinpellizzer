<p>Specklinia cabellensis, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the pale pink or white flowers.</p>
<p>Specklinia cabellensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
