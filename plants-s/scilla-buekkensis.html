<p>Scilla buekkensis, commonly known as the Buekkens scilla, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh alpine conditions, and it plays a significant role in local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scilla buekkensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
