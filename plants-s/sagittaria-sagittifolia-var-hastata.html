                    <h1>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. hastata</h1>
<p>Sagittaria sagittifolia var. hastata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with the leaves emerging from the water surface in a distinctive arrowhead form. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in aquatic habitats.</p>
