<p>Salix dissa var. cereifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf willow, is a variant of the silver willow native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows along water bodies and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination.</p>
<p>The waxleaf willow is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and graceful growth habit.</p>
