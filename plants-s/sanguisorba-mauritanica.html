<p>Sanguisorba mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian sorrel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Sanguisorba mauritanica is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other sorrel species known for their medicinal and ornamental uses.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant.</p>
