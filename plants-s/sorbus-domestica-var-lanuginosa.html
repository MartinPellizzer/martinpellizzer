                    <h1>Sorbus domestica var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Sorbus domestica var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray or white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
