                    <h1>Sphaeranthus foliosus</h1>
<p>Sphaeranthus foliosus, commonly known as the leafy sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sphaeranthus foliosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
