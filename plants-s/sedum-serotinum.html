<p>It is native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows as a low-growing perennial, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture.

<p>Sedum serotinum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
