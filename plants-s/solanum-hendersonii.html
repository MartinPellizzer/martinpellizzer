<p>Solanum hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Henderson in the Pitcairn Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in rocky coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade plants.</p>
<p>Solanum hendersonii is considered a rare and endangered species due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species.</p>
