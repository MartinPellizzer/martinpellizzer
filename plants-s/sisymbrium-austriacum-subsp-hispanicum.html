<p>Sisymbrium austriacum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to penetrate deep into the soil. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed or arid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
