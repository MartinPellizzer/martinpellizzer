                    <h1>Stolidia</h1>
<p>Stolidia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Stolidia species typically produce small, clustered blooms in shades of purple, white, and pink, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, many Stolidia species are cultivated as houseplants.</p>
