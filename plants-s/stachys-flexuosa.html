<p>Stachys flexuosa, commonly known as creeping betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
