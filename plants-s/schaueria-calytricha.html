<p>Schaueria calytricha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
