<p>Schoenoplectus × oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a hybrid wetland plant characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and broad, flat leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and pond edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological diversity. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus × oblongus is an important species in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
