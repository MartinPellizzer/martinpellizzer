                    <h1>Stenosolen grandifolius</h1>
<p>Stenosolen grandifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf stenosolen, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically from June to August. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Stenosolen grandifolius is well adapted to drought and is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
