                    <h1>Salix pseudocaprea</h1>
<p>Salix pseudocaprea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix pseudocaprea thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
