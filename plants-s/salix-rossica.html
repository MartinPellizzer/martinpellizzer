                    <h1>Salix rossica</h1>
<p>Salix rossica, commonly known as Ross's willow, is a species of willow native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or taiga environments. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Salix rossica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and subarctic wildlife.</p>
