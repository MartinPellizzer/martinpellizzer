                    <h1>Santalodes mimosoides</h1>
<p>Santalodes mimosoides, commonly known as the mimosa sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers and woody, branching stems. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, resembling those of mimosas, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is often found in shaded, moist environments within forest understories.</p>
