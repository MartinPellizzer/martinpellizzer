<p>Syzygium subscandens, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round berries. Syzygium subscandens is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
