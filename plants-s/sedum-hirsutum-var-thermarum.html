<p>Sedum hirsutum var. thermarum, commonly known as the Desert Sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10, where it can withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
