                    <h1>Shortia sinensis var. pubinervis</h1>
<p>Shortia sinensis var. pubinervis, commonly known as the pubescent nerveleaf, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rich, humusy soils in forest understories. Its botanical features include a short stem, opposite leaves, and a unique floral structure that attracts pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
