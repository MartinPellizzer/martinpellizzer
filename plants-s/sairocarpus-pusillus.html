                    <h1>Sairocarpus pusillus</h1>
<p>Sairocarpus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf star moss, is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces spores in small, clustered capsules that are often concealed among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
