<p>Salix virescens, commonly known as the green willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and long, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its fibrous bark and flexible stems have historically been used in basket-making and other crafts.</p>
<p>Salix virescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
