                    <h1>Stelis uxoria</h1>
<p>Stelis uxoria, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis uxoria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
