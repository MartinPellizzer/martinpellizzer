                    <h1>Salix longifolia var. angustissima</h1>
<p>Salix longifolia var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>
