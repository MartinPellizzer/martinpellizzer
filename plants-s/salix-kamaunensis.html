<p>Salix kamaunensis, commonly known as the Kamaun willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
