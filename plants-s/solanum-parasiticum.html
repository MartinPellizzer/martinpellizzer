                    <h1>Solanum parasiticum</h1>
<p>Solanum parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially penetrates the roots of host plants to obtain water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has elliptical, often hairy leaves. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
