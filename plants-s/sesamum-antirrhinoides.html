<p>Sesamum antirrhinoides, commonly known as the African sesame or wild sesame, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain tiny, black, oil-rich seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds, though it is less common than cultivated sesame species.</p>
