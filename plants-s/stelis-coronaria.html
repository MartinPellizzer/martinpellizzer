                    <h1>Stelis coronaria</h1>
<p>Stelis coronaria, commonly known as the crowned stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a crown-like arrangement, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage.</p>
<p>Stelis coronaria is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
