                    <h1>Stipagrostis sabulicola</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis sabulicola, commonly known as sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Stipagrostis sabulicola is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
