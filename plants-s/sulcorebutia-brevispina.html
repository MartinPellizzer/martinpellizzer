<p>Sulcorebutia brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined crassulaceae, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
