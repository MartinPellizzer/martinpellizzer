                    <h1>Strobilanthes humblotii</h1>
<p>Strobilanthes humblotii, commonly known as the "Kampot flame flower," is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the humid lowland forests of Cambodia, this plant is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. The plant's unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Strobilanthes humblotii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
