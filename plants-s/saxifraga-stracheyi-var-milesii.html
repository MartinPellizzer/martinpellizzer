                    <h1>Saxifraga stracheyi var. milesii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga stracheyi var. milesii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
