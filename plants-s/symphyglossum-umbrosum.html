                    <h1>Symphyglossum umbrosum</h1>
<p>Symphyglossum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the understory of shaded forests in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires a cool, shaded environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
