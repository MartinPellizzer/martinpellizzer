<p>Schizachyrium brevifolium, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass that thrives in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-gray foliage and distinctive, slender, spike-like inflorescence. The plant is drought-tolerant and often forms dense, mat-like growths that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Little bluestem is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
