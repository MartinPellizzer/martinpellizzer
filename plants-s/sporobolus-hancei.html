                    <h1>Sporobolus hancei</h1>
<p>Sporobolus hancei, commonly known as Hance's spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sporobolus hancei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate flooding and poor soil conditions.</p>
