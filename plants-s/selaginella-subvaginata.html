                    <h1>Selaginella subvaginata</h1>
<p>Selaginella subvaginata, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, and it produces cone-like structures called strobila for reproduction. Selaginella subvaginata is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, where it can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
