<p>Schoenorchis sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, often pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, helping it conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Schoenorchis sarcophylla is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
