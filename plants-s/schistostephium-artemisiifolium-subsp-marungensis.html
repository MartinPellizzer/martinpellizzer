<p>Schistostephium artemisiifolium subsp.</p>
<p>marungensis, commonly known as the Marungensis stephium, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Artemisia, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
