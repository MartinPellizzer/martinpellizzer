                    <h1>Sabia coriacea</h1>
<p>Sabia coriacea, commonly known as the rough sabia, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Sabia coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
