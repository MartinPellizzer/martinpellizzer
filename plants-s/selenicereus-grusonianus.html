<p>Selenicereus grusonianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces a fleshy, edible fruit that is often consumed by local communities. It thrives in warm, arid environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its nocturnal flowering habit is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators active during the night.</p>
