                    <h1>Scirpus cyperinus var. condensatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus cyperinus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering stems that rise from rhizomes, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually reddish at the base and taper to a point.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
