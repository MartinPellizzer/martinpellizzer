<p>Schwenckia filiformis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has small, thread-like leaves that help it float. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Schwenckia filiformis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of tiny water organisms.</p>
