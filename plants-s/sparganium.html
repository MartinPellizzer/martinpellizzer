                    <h1>Sparganium</h1>
<p>Sparganium, commonly known as bur-reed, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil near the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its distinctive seed heads, which resemble small burrs, are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals.</p>
<p>Sparganium species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
