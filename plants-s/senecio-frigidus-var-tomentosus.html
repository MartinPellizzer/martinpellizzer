                    <h1>Senecio frigidus var. tomentosus</h1>
<p>Senecio frigidus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the wooly senecio, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
