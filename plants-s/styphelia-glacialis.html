                    <h1>Styphelia glacialis</h1>
<p>Styphelia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier pink, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It produces small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its cold, dry environment. Styphelia glacialis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh mountain conditions where few other plants can grow.</p>
