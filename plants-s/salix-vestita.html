                    <h1>Salix vestita</h1>
<p>Salix vestita, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Salix vestita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
