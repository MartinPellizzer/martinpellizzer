<p>Salix xerophila var. ilectica, commonly known as the Ilece River willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
