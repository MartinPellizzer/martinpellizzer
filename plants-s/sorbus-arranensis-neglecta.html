<p>Sorbus arranensis neglecta, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the Isle of Arran in Scotland.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its rounded, multi-stemmed growth habit and distinctive white to pale grey bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green berries that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
