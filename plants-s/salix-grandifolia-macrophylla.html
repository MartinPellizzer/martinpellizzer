                    <h1>Salix grandifolia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Salix grandifolia macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
