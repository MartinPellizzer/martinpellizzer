<p>Syzygium novotnyi, commonly known as the Newotny's star gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically small and tart, and are often consumed by local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Syzygium novotnyi is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
