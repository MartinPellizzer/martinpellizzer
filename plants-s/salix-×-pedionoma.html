<p>Salix × pedionoma, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix viminalis (osier willow).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, slender branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
