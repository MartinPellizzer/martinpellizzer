                    <h1>Stapelia hirsuta var. gariepensis</h1>
<p>Stapelia hirsuta var. gariepensis, commonly known as the Gariep Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in short, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with red markings, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
