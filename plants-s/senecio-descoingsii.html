                    <h1>Senecio descoingsii</h1>
<p>Senecio descoingsii, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senecio descoingsii is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
