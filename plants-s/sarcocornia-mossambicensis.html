<p>Sarcocornia mossambicensis, commonly known as the mangrove spinifex, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and estuaries, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its roots form dense mats that help filter out excess salt from the environment.</p>
<p>Sarcocornia mossambicensis is also an important component of the food web in tidal ecosystems.</p>
