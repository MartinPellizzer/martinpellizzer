                    <h1>Sulcorebutia haseltonii</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia haseltonii, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia haseltonii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
