                    <h1>Spergula marina</h1>
<p>Spergula marina, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a small flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tidal zones or on dunes.</p>
<p>Spergula marina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
