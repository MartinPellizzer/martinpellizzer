<p>Sphaeralcea scoparia, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sphaeralcea scoparia is also known for its spherical, woolly seed pods that persist on the plant well into the winter.</p>
