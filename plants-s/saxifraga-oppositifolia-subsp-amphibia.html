<p>Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp.</p>
<p>amphibia, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments, including rocky slopes and tundra, where it forms dense mats to protect itself from extreme cold and wind.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to short growing seasons and is often used as an indicator of environmental changes in polar regions.</p>
