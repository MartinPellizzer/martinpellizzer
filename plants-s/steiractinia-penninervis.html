                    <h1>Steiractinia penninervis</h1>
<p>Steiractinia penninervis, commonly known as the slender-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous roots, allowing it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
