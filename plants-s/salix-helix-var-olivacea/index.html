                            <h1>Salix Helix Var. Olivacea</h1>
<p>Salix helix var. olivacea is a unique variant of the willow family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological value. This plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a subtle olive hue, giving it a refined look. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands and stream banks. Its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife makes it an important species in restoration projects. Despite its beauty, it remains a lesser-known gem within the broader willow genus.</p>
