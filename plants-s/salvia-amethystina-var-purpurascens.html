<p>Salvia amethystina var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple flame sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems covered in dense, velvety purple foliage that takes on a fiery red hue in full sun. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of lavender to deep purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
