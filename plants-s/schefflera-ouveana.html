<p>Schefflera ouveana, commonly known as the Ouvea schefflera, is a tropical plant native to the island of Ouvea in the French archipelago of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Schefflera ouveana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
