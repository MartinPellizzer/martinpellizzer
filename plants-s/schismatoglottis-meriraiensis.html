<p>Schismatoglottis meriraiensis, commonly known as the Meriraiensis arrowroot, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the highland regions of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of dark green, waxy leaves that are often adorned with distinctive markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
