The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Senecio calcarius is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
