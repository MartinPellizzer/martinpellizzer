                    <h1>Saxifraga micrantha f. foliosa</h1>
<p>Saxifraga micrantha f. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad, fleshy, and often covered with a waxy coating to retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
