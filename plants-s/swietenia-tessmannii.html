                    <h1>Swietenia tessmannii</h1>
<p>Swietenia tessmannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
