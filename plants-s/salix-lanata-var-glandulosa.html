                    <h1>Salix lanata var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Salix lanata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its botanical name. The plant typically grows in moist, often shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves may play a role in deterring herbivores or reducing water loss.</p>
