                    <h1>Sisymbrium bilobum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium bilobum, commonly known as two-lobed broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a root-parasitic species that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open upon maturity. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive.</p>
