                    <h1>Saxifraga groenlandica f. flavescens</h1>
<p>Saxifraga groenlandica f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking splash of color to rocky habitats. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its vibrant yellow floral display, which distinguishes it from the more commonly white-flowered parent species.</p>
