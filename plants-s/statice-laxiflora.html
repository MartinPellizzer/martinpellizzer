<p>Statice laxiflora, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
