                    <h1>Sphyrastylis urceilabris</h1>
<p>Sphyrastylis urceilabris, commonly known as the broad-leaved star-leaf, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white and pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
