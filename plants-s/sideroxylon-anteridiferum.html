                    <h1>Sideroxylon anteridiferum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon anteridiferum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Balanophoraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon anteridiferum is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional construction and crafts.</p>
