                    <h1>Streblorrhiza</h1>
<p>Streblorrhiza, commonly known as the "Coral Root," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are myco-heterotrophic, meaning they lack chlorophyll and rely entirely on fungal networks for nutrient absorption. Streblorrhiza species are typically small, with delicate, often colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. They are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The unique relationship between Streblorrhiza and mycorrhizal fungi is a key aspect of their botanical significance.</p>
