                    <h1>Sorbaria sorbifolia f. glabra</h1>
<p>Sorbaria sorbifolia f. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf sand cherry, is a shrub native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which differ from the typical hairy foliage of the species. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
