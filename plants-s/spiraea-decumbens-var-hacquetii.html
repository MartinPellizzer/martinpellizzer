                    <h1>Spiraea decumbens var. hacquetii</h1>
<p>Spiraea decumbens var. hacquetii, commonly known as the Hacquet's weeping spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that cascade gracefully over the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. Its foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy on the upper surface.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments.</p>
