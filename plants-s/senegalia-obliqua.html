                    <h1>Senegalia obliqua</h1>
<p>Senegalia obliqua, commonly known as the screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its leaves are typically small and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Senegalia obliqua is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
