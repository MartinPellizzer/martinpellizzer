<p>Selinum dubium subsp.</p>
<p>salinum, commonly known as the salt saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it thrives in high-salinity soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it is considered an important indicator species for saline habitats.</p>
