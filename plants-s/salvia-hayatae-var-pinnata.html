                    <h1>Salvia hayatae var. pinnata</h1>
<p>Salvia hayatae var. pinnata, commonly known as the pinnate salvia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
