                    <h1>Stelmatocodon</h1>
<p>Stelmatocodon, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or basalt substrates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture.</p>
<p>Stelmatocodon plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations.</p>
