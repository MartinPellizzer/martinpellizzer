                    <h1>Stapelia × discolor var. muley-hassan</h1>
<p>Stapelia × discolor var. muley-hassan, commonly known as the Muley Hassan Stapelia, is a hybrid succulent native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and resilience in low-maintenance environments.</p>
