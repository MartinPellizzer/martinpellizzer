<p>Spiranthes arcisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
