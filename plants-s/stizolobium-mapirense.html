                    <h1>Stizolobium mapirense</h1>
<p>Stizolobium mapirense, commonly known as the Mapire acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant has compound leaves with small, paired leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its woody structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Stizolobium mapirense is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
