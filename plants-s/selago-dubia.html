                    <h1>Selago dubia</h1>
<p>Selago dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, allowing it to conserve water efficiently.</p>
<p>Selago dubia is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
