                    <h1>Scolodia viminea</h1>
<p>Scolodia viminea, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a rosette shape. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Scolodia viminea is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
