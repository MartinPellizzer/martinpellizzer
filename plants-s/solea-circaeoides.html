                    <h1>Solea circaeoides</h1>
<p>Solea circaeoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Solea circaeoides is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
