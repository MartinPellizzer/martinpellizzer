<p>Stelis decurva, commonly known as the drooping stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown.</p>
<p>Stelis decurva thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth.</p>
