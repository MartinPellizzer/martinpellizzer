                    <h1>Silybum marianum var. longispinum</h1>
<p>Silybum marianum var. longispinum, commonly known as the longspined milk thistle, is a variant of the milk thistle species native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive purple flowers. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic to mammals, though it is used in herbal medicine for its potential liver-protecting properties. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
