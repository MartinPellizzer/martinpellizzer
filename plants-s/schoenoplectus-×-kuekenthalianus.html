                    <h1>Schoenoplectus × kuekenthalianus</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus × kuekenthalianus, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or moist soils.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Schoenoplectus acutus and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
