                    <h1>Streptanthus foliosus</h1>
<p>Streptanthus foliosus, commonly known as the leafy broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant that relies on host species for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
