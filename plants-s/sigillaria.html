                    <h1>Sigillaria</h1>
<p>Sigillaria, commonly known as the "scallop fern," is an extinct genus of lycophytes that lived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>Its distinctive features include a segmented stem with spirally arranged leaves that resemble those of modern ferns. The plant's reproductive structures, known as strobili, were located at the tips of the branches. Sigillaria had a robust, woody stem that supported its foliage, which contributed to the formation of coal deposits.</p>
<p>Its fossilized remains provide important insights into the morphology and ecology of ancient plant life.</p>
