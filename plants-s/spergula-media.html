                    <h1>Spergula media</h1>
<p>Spergula media, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it forms dense stands that can stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>Spergula media is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
