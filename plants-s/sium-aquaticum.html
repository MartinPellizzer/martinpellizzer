<p>Sium aquaticum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its roots are tuberous and have a flavor similar to parsnips, though they are not typically consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Sium aquaticum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife.</p>
