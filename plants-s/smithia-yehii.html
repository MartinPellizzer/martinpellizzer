<p>Smithia yehii, commonly known as the Yeh's smithia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small white or pale pink flowers appear in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Smithia yehii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
