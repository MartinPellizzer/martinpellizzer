                    <h1>Sedum callianthum</h1>
<p>Sedum callianthum, commonly known as the desert rose or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its already striking appearance. Its stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sedum callianthum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping.</p>
