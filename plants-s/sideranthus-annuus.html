                    <h1>Sideranthus annuus</h1>
<p>Sideranthus annuus, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is an annual flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that often appear in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sideranthus annuus is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and is adapted to thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
