<p>Steireya cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time.</p>
