                    <h1>Selaginella alutacea var. curtisii</h1>
<p>Selaginella alutacea var. curtisii, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Selaginella alutacea var. curtisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
