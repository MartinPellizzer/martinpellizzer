<p>Stipa inebrians, commonly known as the drunken grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce a profuse display of tiny, pale green to brown florets. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its roots form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Stipa inebrians is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
