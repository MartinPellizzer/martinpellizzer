                    <h1>Stellaria adenophora</h1>
<p>Stellaria adenophora, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in a cluster at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance and contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Stellaria adenophora is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
