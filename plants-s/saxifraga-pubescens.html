<p>Saxifraga pubescens, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
