                    <h1>Salix microdonta</h1>
<p>Salix microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix microdonta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of cold climate ecosystems.</p>
