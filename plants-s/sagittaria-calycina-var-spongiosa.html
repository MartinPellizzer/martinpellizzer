                    <h1>Sagittaria calycina var. spongiosa</h1>
<p>Sagittaria calycina var. spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a spongy texture that helps it float. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it an effective plant for stabilizing aquatic sediments.</p>
<p>Sagittaria calycina var. spongiosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
