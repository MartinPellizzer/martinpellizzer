<p>Sclerocarpus phyllocephalus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and thick foliage to conserve water.</p>
<p>Sclerocarpus phyllocephalus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
