<p>Sonneratia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in brackish or saline water. The genus includes several species, such as Sonneratia alba and Sonneratia ovata, which are characterized by their ability to tolerate saltwater.
