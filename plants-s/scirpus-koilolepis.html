<p>Scirpus koilolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stabilization of wetland soils.</p>
<p>Scirpus koilolepis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
