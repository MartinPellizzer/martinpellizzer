                    <h1>Sarracenia × illustrata</h1>
<p>Sarracenia × illustrata, commonly known as the illustrated pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often brightly colored pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves form tubular structures that serve as both a trap and a means of nutrient absorption. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × illustrata is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique ecological function.</p>
