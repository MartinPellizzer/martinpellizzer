<p>Sadleria pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than true leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Sadleria pallida thrives in shaded, moist environments such as pine rocklands and hammocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
