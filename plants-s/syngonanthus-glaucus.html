                    <h1>Syngonanthus glaucus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus glaucus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Syngonanthus glaucus typically grows in moist, open habitats like wetlands and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
