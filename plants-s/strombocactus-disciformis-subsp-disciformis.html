<p>Strombocactus disciformis subsp.</p>
<p>disciformis, commonly known as the disc-forming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is ribbed and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the apex of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is popular among cactus enthusiasts and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
