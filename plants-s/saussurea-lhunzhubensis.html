                    <h1>Saussurea lhunzhubensis</h1>
<p>Saussurea lhunzhubensis, commonly known as the Lhunzhi saussurea, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and pale yellow to brownish flower heads. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry conditions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it produces achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
