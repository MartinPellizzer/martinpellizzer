                    <h1>Saxifraga propaginea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga propaginea, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are relatively short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga propaginea is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
