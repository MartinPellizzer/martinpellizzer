<p>Solstitiaria melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese solstitiaria, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Malta.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, where it adapts to the harsh, saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
