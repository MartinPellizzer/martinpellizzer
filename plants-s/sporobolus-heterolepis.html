<p>Sporobolus heterolepis, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sporobolus heterolepis is often found in prairie ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
