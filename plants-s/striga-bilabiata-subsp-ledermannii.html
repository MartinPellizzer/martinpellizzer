<p>Striga bilabiata subsp.</p>
<p>ledermannii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, with seeds being dispersed by wind or water. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its impact on cereal crops.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a challenging weed to control in natural and cultivated ecosystems.</p>
