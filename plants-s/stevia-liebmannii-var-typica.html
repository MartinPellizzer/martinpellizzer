                    <h1>Stevia liebmannii var. typica</h1>
<p>Stevia liebmannii var. typica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with tiny, glandular structures called steviol glycosides, which are responsible for its intense sweetness. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in moist, tropical environments. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Stevia liebmannii var. typica is widely cultivated as a natural sweetener due to its non-caloric properties and health benefits.</p>
