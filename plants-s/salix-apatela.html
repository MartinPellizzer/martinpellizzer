<p>Salix apatela, commonly known as the ghost willow, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in arid, rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine, powdery coating that gives them a ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>The ghost willow is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas.</p>
