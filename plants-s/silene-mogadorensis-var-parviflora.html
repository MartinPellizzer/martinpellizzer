<p>Silene mogadorensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the Mogador silene, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and has a low, spreading habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
