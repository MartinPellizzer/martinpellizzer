<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of spikelets that are often adorned with long, bristly hairs. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
