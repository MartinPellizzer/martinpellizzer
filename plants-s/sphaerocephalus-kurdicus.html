                    <h1>Sphaerocephalus kurdicus</h1>
<p>Sphaerocephalus kurdicus, commonly known as the Kurdish globe lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rounded, globe-like thallus that is typically yellowish to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, which together thrive on rock surfaces. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to mycologists and botanists studying lichen diversity and ecological adaptations.</p>
