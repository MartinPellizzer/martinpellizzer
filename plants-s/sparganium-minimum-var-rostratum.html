                    <h1>Sparganium minimum var. rostratum</h1>
<p>Sparganium minimum var. rostratum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other Sparganium species by its narrower leaves and reduced flower clusters.</p>
