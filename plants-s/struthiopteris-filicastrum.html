<p>Struthiopteris filicastrum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Struthiopteris filicastrum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.</p>
