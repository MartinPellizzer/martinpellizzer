<p>Silene pseudovestita, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Silene pseudovestita is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often appearing only after rainfall and disappearing quickly, making it a rare and enchanting sight.</p>
