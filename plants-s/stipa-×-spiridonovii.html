<p>It is a hybrid between Stipa capillata and Stipa trichophora, exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its slender, tufted clumps produce dense panicles of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or red.</p>
