                    <h1>Simira gardneriana</h1>
<p>Simira gardneriana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red drupes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Simira gardneriana is now classified as endangered in many regions.</p>
