                    <h1>Salix perrieri</h1>
<p>Salix perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's willow, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, cool environments, often near streams or in mountainous forests. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine layer of silky hair.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Salix perrieri faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
