                    <h1>Striga multiflora</h1>
<p>Striga multiflora, commonly known as the common witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks true roots, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. It is considered a serious agricultural pest, particularly in cereal crops like maize and sorghum.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to weaken host plants make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
