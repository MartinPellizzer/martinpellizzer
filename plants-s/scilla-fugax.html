                    <h1>Scilla fugax</h1>
<p>Scilla fugax, commonly known as the transient scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It produces striking blue to violet flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after flowering. Scilla fugax thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its short blooming period, it is often referred to as a "fleeting" beauty in botanical gardens.</p>
