<p>Scirpus sparmannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus sparmannii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
