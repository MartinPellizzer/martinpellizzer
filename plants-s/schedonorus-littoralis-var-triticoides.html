                    <h1>Schedonorus littoralis var. triticoides</h1>
<p>Schedonorus littoralis var. triticoides, commonly known as coastal ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dune ecosystems.</p>
