                    <h1>Senegalia lozanoi</h1>
<p>Senegalia lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozan's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are an important food source for various pollinators. Its woody stems are often covered with a layer of fine, white hairs that help reflect sunlight and minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Senegalia lozanoi is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
