<p>Striga rowlandii, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, often causing significant damage to crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Africa and is considered a major weed in agricultural systems.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
