                            <h1>Scrophularia Lucida Subsp. Boissieri</h1>
<p>Boissier's scrophularia, scientifically known as Scrophularia lucida subsp. boissieri, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. This subspecies is distinguished by its bright yellow flowers and velvety foliage, which give it a unique appearance among other members of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Boissier's scrophularia is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
