<p>Sabulina verna, commonly known as spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that aids in anchoring the plant in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Sabulina verna is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
