                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. montticum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. montticum, commonly known as the mountain potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, elongated tubers that often have a rough, netted skin. This form is typically found in high-altitude regions, where it adapts to cooler and more variable climatic conditions. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, sharing traits with other nightshade species.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it an interesting subject for agricultural research and breeding programs.</p>
