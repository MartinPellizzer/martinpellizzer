                    <h1>Salsola orientalis</h1>
<p>Salsola orientalis, commonly known as oriental goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in clusters. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Salsola orientalis is often found in dry grasslands, sandy soils, and along roadsides.</p>
