                    <h1>Stenochlaena amydrophlebia</h1>
<p>Stenochlaena amydrophlebia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
