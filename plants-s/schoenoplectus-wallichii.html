<p>Schoenoplectus wallichii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
