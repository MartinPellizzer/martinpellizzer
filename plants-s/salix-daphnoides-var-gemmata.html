<p>Salix daphnoides var. gemmata, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, grayish-green leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
