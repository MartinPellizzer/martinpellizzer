<p>Sempervivum latiusculum, commonly known as the rosette plant or hen and chicks, is a succulent perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, hardy plants.</p>
