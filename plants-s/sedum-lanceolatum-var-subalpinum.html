                    <h1>Sedum lanceolatum var. subalpinum</h1>
<p>Sedum lanceolatum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedum, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-resistant and suitable for rock gardens or alpine landscapes.</p>
