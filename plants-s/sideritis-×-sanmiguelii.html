                    <h1>Sideritis × sanmiguelii</h1>
<p>Sideritis × sanmiguelii, commonly known as San Miguel's sainfoin, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across rocky and open habitats. Sideritis × sanmiguelii is often found in dry, sunny environments such as steppes and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecological adaptation.</p>
