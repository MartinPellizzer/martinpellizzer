                    <h1>Stipa prolifera</h1>
<p>Stipa prolifera, commonly known as the silvergrass or creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-blue blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
