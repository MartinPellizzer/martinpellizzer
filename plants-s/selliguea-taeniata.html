<p>Selliguea taeniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leafy shoot system, and its leaves are elongated and often arranged in a spiral pattern. Selliguea taeniata lacks true roots, stems, and flowers, and instead reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
