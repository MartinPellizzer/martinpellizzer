                    <h1>Scaphyglottis reedii</h1>
<p>Scaphyglottis reedii, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, adapted for pollination by specific insects such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Scaphyglottis reedii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
