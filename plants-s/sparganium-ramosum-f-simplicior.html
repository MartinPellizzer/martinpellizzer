                    <h1>Sparganium ramosum f. simplicior</h1>
<p>Sparganium ramosum f. simplicior, commonly known as the simple-stemmed bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced branching and simpler inflorescence compared to the typical form, which makes it visually distinct. The plant produces spiky, cylindrical flower heads that are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the water's edge.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity.</p>
