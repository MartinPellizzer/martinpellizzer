<p>Staphidium oxyurum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
