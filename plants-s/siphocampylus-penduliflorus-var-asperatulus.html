                    <h1>Siphocampylus penduliflorus var. asperatulus</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus penduliflorus var. asperatulus, commonly known as the hairy pendulous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular trichomes. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pendulous, bell-shaped flowers with showy, violet-blue petals. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
