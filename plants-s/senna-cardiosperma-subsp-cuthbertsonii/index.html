                            <h1>Senna Cardiosperma Subsp. Cuthbertsonii</h1>
<p>Senna cardiosperma subsp. cuthbertsonii is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is known for its striking yellow flowers and compound leaves that thrive in harsh, dry conditions. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical study. Despite its resilience, it remains a threatened species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
