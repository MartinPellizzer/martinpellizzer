<p>Salvia ottoniana, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable for pollinators.</p>
