                    <h1>Salsola leiosperma</h1>
<p>Salsola leiosperma, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its adaptation to harsh, saline soils.</p>
<p>Salsola leiosperma is often found in disturbed sites and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control.</p>
