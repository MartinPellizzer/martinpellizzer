<p>Saxifraga stellaris var. prolifera, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white woolly hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to produce numerous offsets, contributing to its spread and abundance in suitable habitats.</p>
