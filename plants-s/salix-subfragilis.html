                    <h1>Salix subfragilis</h1>
<p>Salix subfragilis, commonly known as the brittle willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix subfragilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various arctic and subarctic wildlife species.</p>
