<p>It features compact, succulent-like foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
