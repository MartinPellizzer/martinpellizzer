<p>Scolopia nana, commonly known as the dwarf scolopia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. It is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its modest size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil.</p>
