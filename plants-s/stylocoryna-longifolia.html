                    <h1>Stylocoryna longifolia</h1>
<p>Stylocoryna longifolia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its twining stems. The plant produces white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Stylocoryna longifolia is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
