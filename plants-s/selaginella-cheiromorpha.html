<p>Selaginella cheiromorpha, commonly known as the clawed spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and creeping stems that produce spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and ferns.</p>
<p>Selaginella cheiromorpha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
