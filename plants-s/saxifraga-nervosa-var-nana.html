                    <h1>Saxifraga nervosa var. nana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga nervosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and compact growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
