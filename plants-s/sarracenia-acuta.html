                    <h1>Sarracenia acuta</h1>
<p>Sarracenia acuta, commonly known as the acute pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright pitchers that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant's leaves are modified into tubular structures that trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in its nutrient-poor habitat. Sarracenia acuta typically grows in wet, acidic soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
