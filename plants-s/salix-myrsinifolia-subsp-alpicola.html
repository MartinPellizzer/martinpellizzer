<p>Salix myrsinifolia subsp.</p>
<p>alpicola, commonly known as alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
