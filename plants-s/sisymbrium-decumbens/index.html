                            <h1>Sisymbrium Decumbens</h1>
<p>Field mustard, scientifically known as Sisymbrium decumbens, is a hardy annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. With its low-growing habit and clusters of small yellow flowers, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability. Despite its weed-like appearance, it has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
