                    <h1>Salix × subcaesia</h1>
<p>Salix × subcaesia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found growing near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The silver willow is also notable for its role in the production of salicin, a compound related to aspirin.</p>
