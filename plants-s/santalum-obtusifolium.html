<p>Santalum obtusifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a woody plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, elliptic to ovate, and have a leathery texture with a dull green upper surface.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
