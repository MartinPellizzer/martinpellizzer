<p>Stelis viridula, commonly known as the green-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with numerous small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance.</p>
<p>Stelis viridula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
