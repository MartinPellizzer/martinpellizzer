                    <h1>Salicornia hispanica</h1>
<p>Salicornia hispanica, commonly known as Spanish glasswort, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green or reddish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and the stems are often used in culinary applications due to their salty, crunchy texture.</p>
<p>Salicornia hispanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
