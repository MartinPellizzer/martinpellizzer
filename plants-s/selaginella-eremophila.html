                    <h1>Selaginella eremophila</h1>
<p>Selaginella eremophila, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and compact, spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through specialized features such as reduced leaf surfaces and deep root systems. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait typical of its evolutionary group.</p>
<p>Selaginella eremophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other desert organisms.</p>
