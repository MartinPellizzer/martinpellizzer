                    <h1>Stenocephalum brevifolium</h1>
<p>Stenocephalum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-headed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Stenocephalum brevifolium is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland saltbush habitats.</p>
