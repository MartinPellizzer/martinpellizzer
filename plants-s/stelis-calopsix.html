<p>Stelis calopsix, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Stelis calopsix thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
