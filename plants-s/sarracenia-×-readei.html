<p>Sarracenia × readei, commonly known as the Red-tipped Sarracenia, is a hybrid pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-tipped leaves, which are modified to form tubular traps for capturing insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green with red veins, and they secrete a digestive enzyme to break down prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Sarracenia × readei is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
