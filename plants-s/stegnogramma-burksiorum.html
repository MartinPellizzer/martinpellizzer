                    <h1>Stegnogramma burksiorum</h1>
<p>Stegnogramma burksiorum, commonly known as the Burks' stegnogramma, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical structure includes a slender, hairy stem and a root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
