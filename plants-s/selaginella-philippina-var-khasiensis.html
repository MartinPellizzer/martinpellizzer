                    <h1>Selaginella philippina var. khasiensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella philippina var. khasiensis, commonly known as the Khasi spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the northeastern region of India.</p>
<p>This plant is a small, evergreen, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It features a compact rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in the study of bryophyte diversity.</p>
