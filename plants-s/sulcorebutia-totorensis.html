                    <h1>Sulcorebutia totorensis</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia totorensis, commonly known as the Totora bulb cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in a layer of white, waxy hair that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its greenish-gray stems. It is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
