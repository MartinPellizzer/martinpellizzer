                    <h1>Synthyris wyomingensis var. gymnocarpa</h1>
<p>Synthyris wyomingensis var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the Wyoming bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the Great Basin region of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated pods that resemble bladders, which are a unique adaptation for seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is found in sagebrush steppe and other arid habitats. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and linear.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless pods, which set it apart from other varieties of Synthyris.</p>
