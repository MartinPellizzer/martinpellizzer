                    <h1>Sabouraea sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Sabouraea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping sabouraea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Sabouraea sarmentosa is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
