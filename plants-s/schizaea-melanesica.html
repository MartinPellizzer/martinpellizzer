<p>Schizaea melanesica, commonly known as the Melanesian clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and strap-like. Schizaea melanesica reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat.</p>
