                    <h1>Sorghum saccharatum var. rubens</h1>
<p>Sorghum saccharatum var. rubens, commonly known as red sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species characterized by its striking red pigmentation in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is cultivated for its high biomass yield and adaptability to various soil conditions. The red coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which act as natural antioxidants. It is often used in traditional agriculture for forage, biofuel production, and as a source of dietary fiber.</p>
<p>Additionally, its drought tolerance makes it a valuable crop in arid environments.</p>
