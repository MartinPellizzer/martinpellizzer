<p>Serratula salsa, commonly known as the saltwort or seaside serratula, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Serratula salsa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt levels makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
