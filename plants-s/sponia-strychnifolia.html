                    <h1>Sponia strychnifolia</h1>
<p>Sponia strychnifolia, commonly known as the bitter sponia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange pulp. It is notable for containing toxic compounds, including strychnine, which makes it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is primarily of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies.</p>
