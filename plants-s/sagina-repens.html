                    <h1>Sagina repens</h1>
<p>Sagina repens, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, pointed, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sagina repens is often found in disturbed soils, along pathways, and in coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
