                    <h1>Selaginella desvauxii</h1>
<p>Selaginella desvauxii, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a vascular fern that thrives in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a low-growing, mat-forming habit. This plant is native to regions such as southern Africa and parts of the Middle East, where it adapts to extreme drought conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are typically found on the stems.</p>
<p>Selaginella desvauxii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying drought tolerance in plants.</p>
