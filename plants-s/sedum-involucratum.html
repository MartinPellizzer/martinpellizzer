<p>Sedum involucratum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum involucratum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh weather conditions.</p>
