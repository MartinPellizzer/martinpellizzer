                    <h1>Senecio squalidus var. microglossus</h1>
<p>Senecio squalidus var. microglossus, commonly known as the woolly weed or stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, sticky trichomes, which give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Senecio species and is often mistaken for its more common relative, Senecio squalidus.</p>
