<p>Sclerocactus mesae-verdae subsp.</p>
<p>depressus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific environmental needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
