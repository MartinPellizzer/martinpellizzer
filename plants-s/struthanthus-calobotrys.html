<p>Struthanthus calobotrys, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its compact, woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, blooming at night to attract specific pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Struthanthus calobotrys is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
