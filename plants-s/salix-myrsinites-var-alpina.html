                    <h1>Salix myrsinites var. alpina</h1>
<p>Salix myrsinites var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine weeping willow, is a shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches that often droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
