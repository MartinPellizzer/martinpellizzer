<p>Sedum reflexum subsp.</p>
<p>montanum, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid environments.</p>
