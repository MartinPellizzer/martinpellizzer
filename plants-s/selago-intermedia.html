                    <h1>Selago intermedia</h1>
<p>Selago intermedia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access moisture from deeper underground.</p>
<p>Selago intermedia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
