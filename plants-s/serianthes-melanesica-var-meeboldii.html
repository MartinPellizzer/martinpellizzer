<p>Serianthes melanesica var. meeboldii, commonly known as the Melanesian ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
