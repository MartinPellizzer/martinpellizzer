                    <h1>Sedum arboreum</h1>
<p>Sedum arboreum, commonly known as the tree sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to rocky or sandy landscapes. Its ability to withstand drought and poor soil makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Sedum arboreum is also valued for its low maintenance and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
