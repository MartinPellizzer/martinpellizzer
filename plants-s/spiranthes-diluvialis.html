                    <h1>Spiranthes diluvialis</h1>
<p>Spiranthes diluvialis, commonly known as the floodplain lady's tresses, is a rare orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and floodplains, often in areas subject to periodic flooding. The plant produces a dense, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
