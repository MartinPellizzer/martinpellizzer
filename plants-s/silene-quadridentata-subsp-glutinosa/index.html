                            <h1>Silene Quadridentata Subsp. Glutinosa</h1>
<p>Glutinous silene, scientifically known as Silene quadridentata subsp. glutinosa, is a unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is distinguished by its sticky, gelatinous seeds that adhere to the fur of animals and the clothing of humans, aiding in its seed dispersal. This subspecies thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine meadows at high altitudes. Its delicate pink to purple flowers bloom during the summer months, adding a touch of beauty to its rugged habitat. Despite its small size, Glutinous silene plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem.</p>
