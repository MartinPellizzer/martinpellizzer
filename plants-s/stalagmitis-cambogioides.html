                    <h1>Stalagmitis cambogioides</h1>
<p>Stalagmitis cambogioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize efficiently. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
