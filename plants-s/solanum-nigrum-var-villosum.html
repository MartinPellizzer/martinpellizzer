                    <h1>Solanum nigrum var. villosum</h1>
<p>Solanum nigrum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and pharmacological contexts.</p>
