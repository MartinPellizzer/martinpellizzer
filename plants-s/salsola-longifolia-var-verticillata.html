                    <h1>Salsola longifolia var. verticillata</h1>
<p>Salsola longifolia var. verticillata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round, salt-tolerant seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
