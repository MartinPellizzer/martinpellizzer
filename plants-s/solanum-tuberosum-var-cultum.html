<p>Solanum tuberosum var. cultum, commonly known as the cultivated potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its stolons, which root and produce tubers underground. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with simple, alternate, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its tubers, which are the economically important part of the plant, are rich in starch and are widely used as a staple food crop globally.</p>
