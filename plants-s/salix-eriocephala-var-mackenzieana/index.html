<p>Salix eriocephala var. mackenzieana is a unique species of willow native to the arctic and subarctic regions of northern Canada and Alaska. This plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. It features small, fuzzy leaves and produces catkins that are adapted to the extreme climates it inhabits. The variety is particularly notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its resilience makes it a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
