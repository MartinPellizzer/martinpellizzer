<p>Saxifraga stellaris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
