                    <h1>Sphaeroma emoryi</h1>
<p>Sphaeroma emoryi, commonly known as the Emory's sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in marine environments along the western Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a thin layer of mucus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on its radula for feeding on algae and other organic matter. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in shallow, tide pool habitats where it can avoid strong currents.</p>
