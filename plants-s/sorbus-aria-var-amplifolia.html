<p>Sorbus aria var. amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Sorbus aria. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, persistent berries. Its bark is greyish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
