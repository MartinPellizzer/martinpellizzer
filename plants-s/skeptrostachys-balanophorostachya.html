                    <h1>Skeptrostachys balanophorostachya</h1>
<p>Skeptrostachys balanophorostachya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is unable to perform photosynthesis, making it dependent on its host for survival. It produces striking, pale green or white flowers that are often difficult to spot in the dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an endangered species.</p>
