<p>Sebastiania catingae, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or catinga starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often mistaken for starfruits, though they are not related to the genus Averrhoa. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
