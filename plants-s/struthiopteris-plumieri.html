<p>Struthiopteris plumieri, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, herbaceous fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically composed of a central axis with multiple leaflets, showcasing complex vascular structures typical of ferns.</p>
