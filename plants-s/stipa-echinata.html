<p>Stipa echinata, commonly known as the prickly grass or stiff beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of short, bristle-tipped lemma-like structures. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. Its foliage is narrow and坚韧, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa echinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and architectural form.</p>
