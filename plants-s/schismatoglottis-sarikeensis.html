<p>Schismatoglottis sarikeensis, commonly known as the Sarikeensis schismatoglottis, is a rare member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers that are typically greenish-white with a prominent lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
