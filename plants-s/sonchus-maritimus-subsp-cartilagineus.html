<p>Sonchus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>cartilagineus, commonly known as sea lettuce or sea sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid or salty conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
