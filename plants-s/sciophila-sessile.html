<p>Sciophila sessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shade plant, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in forest understories where it thrives in low light conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>Sciophila sessile is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in shaded, wet areas and for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
