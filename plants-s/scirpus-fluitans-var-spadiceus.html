                    <h1>Scirpus fluitans var. spadiceus</h1>
<p>Scirpus fluitans var. spadiceus, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that grow entirely above water.</p>
<p>It produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and often mistaken for flowers. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on water levels.</p>
