                            <h1>Salix Viminalis Subsp. Rossica</h1>
<p>Salix viminalis subsp. rossica is a lesser-known but ecologically significant plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. This subspecies of willow thrives in wetland and riparian habitats, often found along riverbanks and marshy areas. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its historical use in basket weaving and as a source of flexible material highlights its practical value.</p>
