                    <h1>Sporobolus arundinaceus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus arundinaceus, commonly known as galleta, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Sporobolus arundinaceus is also valued for its forage quality and historical use by indigenous peoples.</p>
