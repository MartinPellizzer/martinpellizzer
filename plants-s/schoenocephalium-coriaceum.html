<p>Schoenocephalium coriaceum, commonly known as the hard-leaved starhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Schoenocephalium coriaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
