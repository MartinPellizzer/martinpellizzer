                    <h1>Serapias parviflora f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Serapias parviflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a rare and striking variant of the serapias genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its green, succulent leaves. Native to the limestone soils of southern Europe, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its compact growth habit and unique floral coloration make it a notable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
