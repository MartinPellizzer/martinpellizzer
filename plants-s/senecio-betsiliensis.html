<p>Senecio betsiliensis, commonly known as the Comoro skyflower, is a strikingly beautiful succulent native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which consists of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
