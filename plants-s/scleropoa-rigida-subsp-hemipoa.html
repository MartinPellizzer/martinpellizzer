<p>Scleropoa rigida subsp.</p>
<p>hemipoa, commonly known as the hardstem needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rigid, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
