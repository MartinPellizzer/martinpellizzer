                    <h1>Sabulina acutiflora</h1>
<p>Sabulina acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Sabulina acutiflora is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
