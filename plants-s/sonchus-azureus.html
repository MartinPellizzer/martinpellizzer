                    <h1>Sonchus azureus</h1>
<p>Sonchus azureus, commonly known as blue sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The plant features a rosette of silver- or blue-hued leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
