                    <h1>Strychnos pentantha</h1>
<p>Strychnos pentantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions.</p>
