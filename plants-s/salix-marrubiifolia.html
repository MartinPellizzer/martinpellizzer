                    <h1>Salix marrubiifolia</h1>
<p>Salix marrubiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Salix marrubiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments.</p>
