<p>Sibirotrisetum sibiricum subsp.</p>
<p>sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its overall structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as tundra and steppe.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler regions.</p>
