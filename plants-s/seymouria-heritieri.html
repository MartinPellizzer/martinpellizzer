                    <h1>Seymouria heritieri</h1>
<p>Seymouria heritieri, commonly known as the Seymour Island fern, is a fossil plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feather-like fronds and is considered an early relative of modern ferns. The plant's structure suggests it was a vascular plant with complex root systems. It thrived in swampy environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits.</p>
<p>Its study provides insights into the evolution of early land plants and paleoecological conditions of the time.</p>
