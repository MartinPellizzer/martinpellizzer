                    <h1>Sanicula graveolens var. septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Sanicula graveolens var. septentrionalis, commonly known as northern hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It features a tall, hollow stem that is often reddish-purple in color, with a distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>The species is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
