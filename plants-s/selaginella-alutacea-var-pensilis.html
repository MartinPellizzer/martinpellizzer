                    <h1>Selaginella alutacea var. pensilis</h1>
<p>Selaginella alutacea var. pensilis, commonly known as the hanging clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
