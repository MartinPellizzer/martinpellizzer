<p>Synaedrys crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with prominent, broad veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
