<p>Soyeria viscidula, commonly known as the sticky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in deterring herbivores. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Soyeria viscidula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
