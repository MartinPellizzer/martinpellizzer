                    <h1>Saussurea caespitosa var. depressa</h1>
<p>Saussurea caespitosa var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarfed globemallow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single, elongated inflorescence, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme alpine conditions.</p>
