                    <h1>Sparganium ramosum f. platycarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium ramosum f. platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of yellowish flowers that develop into spiky, berry-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique fruit morphology, which is broader and more robust compared to the typical form.</p>
