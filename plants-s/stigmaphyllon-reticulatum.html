<p>Stigmaphyllon reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined stigmaphyllon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a finely reticulated venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Stigmaphyllon reticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
