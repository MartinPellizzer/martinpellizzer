                    <h1>Sida alpicola</h1>
<p>Sida alpicola, commonly known as the alpine sida, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Sida alpicola has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its short stature and compact growth form allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils at high elevations.</p>
