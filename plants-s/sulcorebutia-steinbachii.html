                    <h1>Sulcorebutia steinbachii</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia steinbachii, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a low-growing, perennial cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia steinbachii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
