                    <h1>Spondylantha aphylla</h1>
<p>Spondylantha aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spondylantha, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
