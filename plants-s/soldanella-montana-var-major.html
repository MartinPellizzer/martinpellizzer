                    <h1>Soldanella montana var. major</h1>
<p>Soldanella montana var. major, commonly known as the mountain soldanella, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are elliptical, hairy, and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its cold, rocky habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
