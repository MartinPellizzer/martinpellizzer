<p>Salix chapmanii, commonly known as Chapmann's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian areas. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Salix chapmanii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and support local wildlife.</p>
