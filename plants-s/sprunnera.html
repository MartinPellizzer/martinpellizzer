<p>Sprunnera, commonly known as the silverleaf sprunnera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, silver-blue leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Sprunnera is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
