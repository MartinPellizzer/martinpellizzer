                    <h1>Salix hibernica</h1>
<p>Salix hibernica, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix hibernica is valued for its fast growth and ability to stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
