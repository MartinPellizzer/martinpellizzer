<p>Solanum antipoviczii, commonly known as the Antipoviczii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. It produces small, round berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Solanum antipoviczii is considered a rare and relatively understudied species.</p>
