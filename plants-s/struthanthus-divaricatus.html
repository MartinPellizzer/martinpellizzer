<p>Struthanthus divaricatus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling, low-growing habit with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
