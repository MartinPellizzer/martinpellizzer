<p>Scleranthus polyclados, commonly known as the common thorned smartweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, often with five petals. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
