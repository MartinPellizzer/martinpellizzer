<p>Spiranthes storeri, commonly known as the Storer's ladies' tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in association with other rare plant species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
