                    <h1>Sarcozygium</h1>
<p>Sarcozygium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its perennial herbaceous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features rhizomatous stems and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Sarcozygium species are native to regions of eastern North America and are often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, these plants are generally avoided by herbivores and are considered to have limited horticultural value.</p>
