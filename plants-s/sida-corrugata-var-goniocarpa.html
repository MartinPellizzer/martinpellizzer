                    <h1>Sida corrugata var. goniocarpa</h1>
<p>Sida corrugata var. goniocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical features are more notable for their structural adaptations to arid environments.</p>
