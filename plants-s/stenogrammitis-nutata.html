<p>Stenogrammitis nutata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stenogrammitis, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with the youngest leaves at the center and older ones radiating outward.

<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
