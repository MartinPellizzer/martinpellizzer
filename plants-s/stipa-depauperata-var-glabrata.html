                    <h1>Stipa depauperata var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Stipa depauperata var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. The plant produces feathery, branched inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments.</p>
