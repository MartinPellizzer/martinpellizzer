<p>Struthiopteris corralensis, commonly known as the Corralensis shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems.</p>
