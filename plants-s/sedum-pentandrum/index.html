                            <h1>Sedum Pentandrum</h1>
<p>Stonecrop, scientifically known as Sedum pentandrum, is a hardy succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. This resilient plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care. With its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, Sedum pentandrum is a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes.</p>
