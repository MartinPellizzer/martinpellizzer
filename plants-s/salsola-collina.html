<p>Salsola collina, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Salsola collina is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
