This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophylls are arranged in whorls, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study.</p>
