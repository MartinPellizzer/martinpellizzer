                    <h1>Scirpus sylvaticus f. cephaloideus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sylvaticus f. cephaloideus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush, characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
