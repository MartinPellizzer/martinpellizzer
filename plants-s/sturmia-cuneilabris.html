                    <h1>Sturmia cuneilabris</h1>
<p>Sturmia cuneilabris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sturmia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Sturmia cuneilabris thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
