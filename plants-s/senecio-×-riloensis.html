<p>Senecio × riloensis, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Senecio squalidus and Senecio jacobaea, two native European species. The plant typically grows in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
