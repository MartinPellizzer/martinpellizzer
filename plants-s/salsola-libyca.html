                    <h1>Salsola libyca</h1>
<p>Salsola libyca, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Salsola libyca is often found in sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution across its native range.</p>
