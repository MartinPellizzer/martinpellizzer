<p>Spergula salina var. longicaulis, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it ecologically important in salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with fluctuating water levels and is adapted to withstand both flooding and drought.</p>
