                    <h1>Saxifraga pedemontana pulvinaris</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pedemontana pulvinaris, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid, alpine habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates.</p>
