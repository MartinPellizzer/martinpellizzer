                    <h1>Stachyurus praecox var. leucotrichus</h1>
<p>Stachyurus praecox var. leucotrichus, commonly known as the silver-leaf stachyurus, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are often followed by showy, red or pink berries in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical species, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
