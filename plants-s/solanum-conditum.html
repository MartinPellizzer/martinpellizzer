                    <h1>Solanum conditum</h1>
<p>Solanum conditum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, egg-shaped berries that turn from green to black as they mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanin and scopolamine.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
