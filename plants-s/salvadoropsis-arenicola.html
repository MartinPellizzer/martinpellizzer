<p>Salvadoropsis arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments with minimal water availability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its structure includes a cylindrical stem with spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
