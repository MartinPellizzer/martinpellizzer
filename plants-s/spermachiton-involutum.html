                    <h1>Spermachiton involutum</h1>
<p>Spermachiton involutum, commonly known as the curled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are often rolled or curled, forming the specialized structures that aid in trapping insects.</p>
<p>Spermachiton involutum plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
