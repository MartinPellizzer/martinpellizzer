                    <h1>Senecio scalaris var. parrasianus</h1>
<p>Senecio scalaris var. parrasianus, commonly known as the Parra's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Senecio scalaris by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>
