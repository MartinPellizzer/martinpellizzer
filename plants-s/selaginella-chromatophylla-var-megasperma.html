                    <h1>Selaginella chromatophylla var. megasperma</h1>
<p>Selaginella chromatophylla var. megasperma, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, creeping stems and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a trait known as heterospory. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
