                    <h1>Schefflera arboricola</h1>
<p>Schefflera arboricola, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown of palmate leaves that radiate from a central stem. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries, though these are not typically consumed by humans.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
