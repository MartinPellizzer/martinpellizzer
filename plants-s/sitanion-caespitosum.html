                    <h1>Sitanion caespitosum</h1>
<p>Sitanion caespitosum, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal restoration projects to prevent erosion.</p>
