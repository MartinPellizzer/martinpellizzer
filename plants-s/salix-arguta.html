<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix arguta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
