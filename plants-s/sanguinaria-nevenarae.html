<p>Sanguinaria nevenarae, commonly known as the crimson root, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant possesses a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy, dark green appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
