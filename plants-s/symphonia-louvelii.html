                    <h1>Symphonia louvelii</h1>
<p>Symphonia louvelii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Symphonia louvelii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
