<p>Saxifraga vernalis, commonly known as the spring saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically features rosettes of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Saxifraga vernalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
