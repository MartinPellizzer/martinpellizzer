                    <h1>Stathmostelma welwitschii var. bagshawei</h1>
<p>Stathmostelma welwitschii var. bagshawei, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in the arid conditions of the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to survive in extreme environments with minimal water. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms. Its structure is adapted to reduce water loss and maximize light absorption.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its resilience and ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
