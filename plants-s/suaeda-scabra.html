<p>Suaeda scabra, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Suaeda scabra is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
