<p>Selaginella rodriguesiana, commonly known as the Rodrigues spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
