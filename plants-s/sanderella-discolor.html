<p>Sanderella discolor, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Sanderella discolor is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
