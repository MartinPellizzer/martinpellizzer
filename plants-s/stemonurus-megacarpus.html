                    <h1>Stemonurus megacarpus</h1>
<p>Stemonurus megacarpus, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fertile fronds that produce numerous spore-bearing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in anchoring it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification.</p>
