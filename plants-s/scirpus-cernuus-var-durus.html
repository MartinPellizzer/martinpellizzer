<p>Scirpus cernuus var. durus, commonly known as the hardstem bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
