                    <h1>Salix urophylla</h1>
<p>Salix urophylla, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
