<p>Stellaria moenchioides, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink star-shaped flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as lawns, gardens, and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in compacted soils.</p>
<p>Stellaria moenchioides is often considered a weed but is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
