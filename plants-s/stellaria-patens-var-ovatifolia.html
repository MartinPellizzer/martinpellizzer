                    <h1>Stellaria patens var. ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Stellaria patens var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are narrow and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant often forms dense mats on moist soils. It thrives in shaded, woodland environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated, ovate leaves compared to the more rounded leaves of the typical Stellaria patens.</p>
