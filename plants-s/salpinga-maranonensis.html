<p>Salpinga maranonensis, commonly known as the Maranon pipevine, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinators, which are certain species of flies. Its vines can grow up to several meters long, often climbing trees or shrubs in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and ecological interest.</p>
