                    <h1>Salix annulifera var. macriula</h1>
<p>Salix annulifera var. macriula, commonly known as the large-leaf willow, is a variant of the annulifera willow native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical annulifera. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and along streams, contributing to erosion control.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
