                    <h1>Salix × schatzii</h1>
<p>Salix × schatzii, commonly known as the Schatz willow, is a hybrid species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and riparian zones. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces catkins in early spring. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful form and the soft yellow flowers that appear in early spring.</p>
<p>Salix × schatzii is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
