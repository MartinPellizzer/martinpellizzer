<p>Steffensia salicariifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that resemble those of willow species, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments, contributing to ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Steffensia salicariifolia is often found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes.</p>
