<p>Struthiopteris schiedeana, commonly known as the giant woodfern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
