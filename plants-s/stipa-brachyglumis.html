The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Stipa brachyglumis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments.</p>
