<p>Salix babylonica f. androgyna, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a unique hybrid form of the weeping willow that exhibits androgyny, meaning it possesses both male and female reproductive structures on the same plant.</p>

The plant is characterized by its long, cascading branches and heart-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a common sight in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control.</p>
