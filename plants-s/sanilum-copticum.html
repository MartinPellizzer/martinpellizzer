                    <h1>Sanilum copticum</h1>
<p>Sanilum copticum, commonly known as the Egyptian lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Nile River basin.</p>
<p>It features large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom at night, followed by yellowish-white petals that open in the morning. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supporting the flower stalks. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Sanilum copticum has been historically significant in Egyptian culture and is often associated with rebirth and the sun god Ra.</p>
