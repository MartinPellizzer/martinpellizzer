                <h1>Synaedrys hallieri</h1>
<p>Synaedrys hallieri, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, such as pines and podocarps, and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are consumed by birds that help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Synaedrys hallieri plays a unique ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with host trees and wildlife.</p>
