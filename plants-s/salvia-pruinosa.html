<p>Salvia pruinosa, commonly known as the silver sage or woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hairs, which give it a silvery appearance and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Salvia pruinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
