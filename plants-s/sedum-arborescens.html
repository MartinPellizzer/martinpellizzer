                    <h1>Sedum arborescens</h1>
<p>Sedum arborescens, commonly known as the tree sedum, is a perennial succulent native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its drought tolerance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense mats makes it effective for erosion control in dry, rocky environments.</p>
