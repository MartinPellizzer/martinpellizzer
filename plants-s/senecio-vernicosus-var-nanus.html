                    <h1>Senecio vernicosus var. nanus</h1>
<p>Senecio vernicosus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants.</p>
