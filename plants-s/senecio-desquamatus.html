                    <h1>Senecio desquamatus</h1>
<p>Senecio desquamatus, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senecio desquamatus is adapted to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
