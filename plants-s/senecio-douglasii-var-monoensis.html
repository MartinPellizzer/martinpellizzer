<p>Senecio douglasii var. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake senecio, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly around Mono Lake in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is considered rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
