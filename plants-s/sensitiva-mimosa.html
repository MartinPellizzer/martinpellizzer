                    <h1>Sensitiva mimosa</h1>
<p>Sensitiva mimosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feather-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The botanical name *Mimosa pudica* reflects its unique ability to react to environmental stimuli.</p>
