                    <h1>Sorema littoralis</h1>
<p>Sorema littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh plant, is a halophytic species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tidal flats, and estuaries where it tolerates high salinity and periodic inundation. Its flowering stems are erect and bear small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Sorema littoralis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
