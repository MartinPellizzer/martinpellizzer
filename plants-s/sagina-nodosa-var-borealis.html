The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important component of boreal and Arctic ecosystems.</p>
