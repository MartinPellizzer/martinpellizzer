                    <h1>Setaria excurrens</h1>
<p>Setaria excurrens, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is an annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often turn golden yellow as they mature. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Setaria excurrens is often considered a weed but is also studied for its potential in biofuel production and soil stabilization.</p>
