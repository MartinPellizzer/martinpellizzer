<p>Schoenus nitens, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in moist, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Schoenus nitens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
