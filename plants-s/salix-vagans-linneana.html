<p>Salix vagans linneana, commonly known as the wandering willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and moist meadow environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and short growing seasons.</p>
