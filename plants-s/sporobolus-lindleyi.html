<p>Sporobolus lindleyi, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and sandy environments, making it a common sight in desert landscapes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh, open habitats.</p>
<p>Sporobolus lindleyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
