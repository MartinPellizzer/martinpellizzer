<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and carbon sequestration. Its structure consists of a central stem with branching filaments covered in small, leaf-like structures called rhizoids.</p>
