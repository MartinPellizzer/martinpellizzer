                    <h1>Striga angustifolia</h1>
<p>Striga angustifolia, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests crops such as sorghum and millet.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth stages of its host, often causing significant yield losses.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a major agricultural pest in various parts of Africa.</p>
