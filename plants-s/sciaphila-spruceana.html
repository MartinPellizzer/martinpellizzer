                    <h1>Sciaphila spruceana</h1>
<p>Sciaphila spruceana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on the surfaces of trees, without relying on soil. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of dense forests where light is limited. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air, while its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and rarity, Sciaphila spruceana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
