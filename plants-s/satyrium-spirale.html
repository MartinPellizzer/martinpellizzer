<p>Satyrium spirale, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of petals and sepals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Satyrium spirale is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
