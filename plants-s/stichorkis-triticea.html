<p>Stichorkis triticea, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive awns, which are bristle-like structures that give the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Stichorkis triticea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
