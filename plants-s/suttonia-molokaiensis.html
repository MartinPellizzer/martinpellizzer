<p>Suttonia molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokaʻi suttonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Molokaʻi.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of the forest understory, often near streams or in rocky habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often trailing.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Suttonia molokaiensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
