<p>Syzygium kinabaluense subsp.</p>
<p>exiguifolium, commonly known as the Bornean tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by edible, sour fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary lowland and hill dipterocarp forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
