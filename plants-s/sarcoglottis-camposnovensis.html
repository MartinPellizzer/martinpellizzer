<p>Sarcoglottis camposnovensis, commonly known as the Brazilian slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
