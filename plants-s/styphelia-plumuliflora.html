<p>Styphelia plumuliflora, commonly known as the plumose styphelia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces delicate, white, woolly flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to its compact form. Styphelia plumuliflora thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral display and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats.</p>
