                    <h1>Statice hirsuta</h1>
<p>Statice hirsuta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>Statice hirsuta is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
