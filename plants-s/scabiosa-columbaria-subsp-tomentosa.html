<p>Scabiosa columbaria subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
