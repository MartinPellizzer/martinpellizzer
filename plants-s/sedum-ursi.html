<p>Sedum ursi, commonly known as stonecrop or rockcrop, is a succulent plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically in the summer months. It is often found growing on cliffs, ledges, and in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Sedum ursi is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
