<p>Silene serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Silene serpentinicola is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
