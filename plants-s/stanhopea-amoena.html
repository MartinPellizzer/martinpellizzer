                    <h1>Stanhopea amoena</h1>
<p>Stanhopea amoena, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive coloration of pink and white. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its seasonal environment. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on trees rather than in soil, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded forest conditions.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique scent is a key feature, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
