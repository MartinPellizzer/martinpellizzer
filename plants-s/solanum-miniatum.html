                    <h1>Solanum miniatum</h1>
<p>Solanum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature nightshade, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with small, egg-shaped leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple. It produces tiny berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature, containing seeds that can germinate under suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles.</p>
