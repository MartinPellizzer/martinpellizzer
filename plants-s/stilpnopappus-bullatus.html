<p>Stilpnopappus bullatus, commonly known as the bullate cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
