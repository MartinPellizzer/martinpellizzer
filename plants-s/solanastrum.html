<p>Solanastrum, commonly known as the nightshade or desert nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often yellow or white flowers. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Solanastrum species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
