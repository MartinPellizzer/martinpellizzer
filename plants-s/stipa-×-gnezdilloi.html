                    <h1>Stipa × gnezdilloi</h1>
<p>Stipa × gnezdilloi, commonly known as the hybrid false oat, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Stipa capillata and Stipa robusta.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its morphology reflects a combination of traits from both parental species, making it a notable example of interspecific hybridization in the grass family.</p>
<p>Stipa × gnezdilloi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments.</p>
