                    <h1>Stephanopodium magnifolium</h1>
<p>Stephanopodium magnifolium, commonly known as the grandleaf starflower, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and purple. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broad, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stephanopodium magnifolium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
