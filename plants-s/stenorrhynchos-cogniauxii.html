                    <h1>Stenorrhynchos cogniauxii</h1>
<p>Stenorrhynchos cogniauxii, commonly known as the Cognaux's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its floral structure is characterized by a short, slender spur and a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
