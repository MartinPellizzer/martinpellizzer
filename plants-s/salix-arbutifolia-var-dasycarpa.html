<p>Salix arbutifolia var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-berry willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, hairy, berry-like fruits that are clustered in groups. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
