<p>Santalum austrocaledonicum var. austrocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonia sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic tree native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in the fragrance and furniture industries. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical rainforests and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often elliptical in shape, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The species is critically endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting of its valuable wood.</p>
