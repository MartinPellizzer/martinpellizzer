                    <h1>Salsola mendocinensis</h1>
<p>Salsola mendocinensis, commonly known as saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically inconspicuous and borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and arid environments, often found in coastal areas and salt flats.</p>
<p>Salsola mendocinensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
