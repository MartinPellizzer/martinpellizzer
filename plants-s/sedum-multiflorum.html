<p>Sedum multiflorum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in summer. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Sedum multiflorum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>
