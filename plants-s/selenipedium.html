                    <h1>Selenipedium</h1>
<p>Selenipedium, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a ghostly silhouette, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are large, showy, and often have a striking color contrast between the petals and sepals.</p>
<p>Selenipedium is known for its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
