                    <h1>Stonesia heterospathella</h1>
<p>Stonesia heterospathella, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, low-growing rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture, and they produce sporangia on the underside, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
