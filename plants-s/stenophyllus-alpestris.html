<p>Stenophyllus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine feather grass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Stenophyllus alpestris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of mountain ecosystems.</p>
