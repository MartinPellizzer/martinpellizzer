                    <h1>Schefflera feriarum</h1>
<p>Schefflera feriarum, commonly known as the "Festival Schefflera," is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, rounded canopy of glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Schefflera feriarum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
