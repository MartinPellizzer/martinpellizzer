<p>Spiesia tragacanthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Spiesia tragacanthoides is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind.</p>
