                    <h1>Setaria pallide-fusca var. ictura</h1>
<p>Setaria pallide-fusca var. ictura, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, golden-yellow inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environments, including agricultural fields and roadside areas. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of seeds.</p>
<p>This annual grass is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in biofuel production and soil stabilization.</p>
