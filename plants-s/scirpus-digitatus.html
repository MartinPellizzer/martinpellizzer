<p>Scirpus digitatus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Scirpus digitatus is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
