<p>Siphocampylus longipedunculatus var. trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed siphocampylus, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and compound leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
