<p>Selaginella bluuensis, commonly known as the blue star moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called microsporangia and megasporangia, are essential for its spore dispersal and propagation.</p>
