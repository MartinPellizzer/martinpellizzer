                    <h1>Stapelia × erecta</h1>
<p>Stapelia × erecta, commonly known as the hybrid African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stapelia hirtella and Stapelia gigantea.</p>
<p>Stapelia × erecta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
