                    <h1>Striga asiatica var. humilis</h1>
<p>Striga asiatica var. humilis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests cereal crops such as maize, sorghum, and millet.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the vascular system of the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with alternate leaves. It is native to Africa and thrives in warm, dry climates, often becoming a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
