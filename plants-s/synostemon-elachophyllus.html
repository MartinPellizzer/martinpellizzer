                    <h1>Synostemon elachophyllus</h1>
<p>Synostemon elachophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf synostemon, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and unique foliage make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
