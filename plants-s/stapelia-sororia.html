<p>Stapelia sororia, commonly known as the sweet stinkbug plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces large, waxy, yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies.
