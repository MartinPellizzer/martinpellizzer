                    <h1>Selaginella chromatophylla f. versicolor</h1>
<p>Selaginella chromatophylla f. versicolor, commonly known as the variegated spike moss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that exhibit a striking color variation, ranging from green to yellow and red, depending on environmental conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are typically located at the base of the plant, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
