<p>Smilax panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian greenbriar, is a climbing shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage, which help it to cling to trees and other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Smilax panamensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats.</p>
