<p>Saxifraga valdensis, commonly known as the Valdenses saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga valdensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult terrain.</p>
