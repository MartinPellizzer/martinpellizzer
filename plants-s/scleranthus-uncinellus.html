                    <h1>Scleranthus uncinellus</h1>
<p>Scleranthus uncinellus, commonly known as the hooked sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds with hooked awns, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
