<p>Sciaphila flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Sciaphila flexuosa is considered a threatened species.</p>
