<p>Serpocaulon sehnemii, commonly known as the Schneemii serpentine, is a rare and unique member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico. This plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, serpentine soils. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Serpocaulon sehnemii is considered a threatened species.</p>
