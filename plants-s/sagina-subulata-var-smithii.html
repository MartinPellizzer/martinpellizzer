<p>Sagina subulata var. smithii, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, succulent, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish fuzz. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas.</p>
