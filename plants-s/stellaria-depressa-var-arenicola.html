<p>Stellaria depressa var. arenicola, commonly known as sand starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has thin, spreading stems and small, narrow leaves that help it thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in dunes, gravelly slopes, and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
