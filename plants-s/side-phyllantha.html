                    <h1>Side phyllantha</h1>
<p>Side phyllantha, commonly known as the "corky leaf" plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
