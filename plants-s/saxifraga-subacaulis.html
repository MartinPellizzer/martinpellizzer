                    <h1>Saxifraga subacaulis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga subacaulis, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help it retain heat and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga subacaulis is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
