                    <h1>Stapelia × tarantuloides</h1>
<p>Stapelia × tarantuloides, commonly known as the giant star cactus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Stapelia hirtella and Stapelia gigantea.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often spiny stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and arid garden environments.</p>
