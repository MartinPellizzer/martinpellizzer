                    <h1>Semeiandra</h1>
<p>Semeiandra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, waxy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Semeiandra is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native regions.</p>
