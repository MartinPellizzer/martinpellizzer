<p>Schizocalomyrtus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Schizocalomyrtus species often have thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss and are known for their ability to bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
