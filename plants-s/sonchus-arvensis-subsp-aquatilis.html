<p>Sonchus arvensis subsp.</p>
<p>aquatilis, commonly known as water thistle, is a wetland plant characterized by its rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. Its leaves are usually basal and may have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes.</p>
