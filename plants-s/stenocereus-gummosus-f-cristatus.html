                    <h1>Stenocereus gummosus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Stenocereus gummosus f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate organ pipe cactus, is a unique variant of the organ pipe cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that form a distinctive crest or "cristate" shape, which is a result of a genetic mutation. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny, arid environment. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
