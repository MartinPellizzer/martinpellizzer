<p>Smilax globulifera, commonly known as the globular smilax, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor to supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by the development of red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>Smilax globulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
