<p>Sedum hypogaeum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Sedum hypogaeum is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ability to spread easily.</p>
