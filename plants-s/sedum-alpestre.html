<p>Sedum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late summer. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
<p>Sedum alpestre is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
