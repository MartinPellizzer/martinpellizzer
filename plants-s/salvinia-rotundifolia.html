                    <h1>Salvinia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Salvinia rotundifolia, commonly known as water mallow, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls along its stolons. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting water ecosystems.</p>
