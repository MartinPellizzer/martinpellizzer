<p>Saxifraga longifolia var. ghatica, commonly known as the Ghatic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
