                    <h1>Scirpus limensis</h1>
<p>Scirpus limensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus limensis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
