<p>Sedum villosum subsp.</p>
<p>pentandrum, commonly known as the wooly stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
