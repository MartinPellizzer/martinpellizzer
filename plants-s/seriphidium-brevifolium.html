<p>Seriphidium brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Seriphidium brevifolium is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
