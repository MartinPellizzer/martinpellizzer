                    <h1>Striga</h1>
<p>Striga, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects crops such as sorghum and millet in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, drawing nutrients and water, which can severely stunt growth or even kill the host. Striga produces a large number of tiny, winged seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, narrow leaves.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the host plant, making it a significant challenge for agricultural productivity in affected regions.</p>
