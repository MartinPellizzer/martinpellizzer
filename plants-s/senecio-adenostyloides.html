                    <h1>Senecio adenostyloides</h1>
<p>Senecio adenostyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
