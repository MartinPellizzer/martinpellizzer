                    <h1>Senegalia saltilloensis</h1>
<p>Senegalia saltilloensis, commonly known as the Saltillo acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines or modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Senegalia saltilloensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
