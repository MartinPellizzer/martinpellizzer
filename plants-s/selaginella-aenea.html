                    <h1>Selaginella aenea</h1>
<p>Selaginella aenea, commonly known as the silver spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. Selaginella aenea reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it has a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This resilience makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
