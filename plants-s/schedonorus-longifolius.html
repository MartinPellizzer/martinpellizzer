                    <h1>Schedonorus longifolius</h1>
<p>Schedonorus longifolius, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically rolled when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
