                    <h1>Saxifraga fortunei var. glabra</h1>
<p>Saxifraga fortunei var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates.</p>
