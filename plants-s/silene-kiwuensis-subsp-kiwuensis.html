<p>Silene kiwuensis subsp.</p>
<p>kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kivu rockflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Albertine Rift region of eastern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in montane grasslands and forest margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
