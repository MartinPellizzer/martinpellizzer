<p>Stelis physoglossa, commonly known as the fat lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often swollen pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Stelis physoglossa is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
