                    <h1>Sclerochloa rigida</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa rigida, commonly known as rigid grass or rigid needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant has a deep root system, enabling it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Sclerochloa rigida is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
