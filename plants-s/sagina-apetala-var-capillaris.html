<p>Sagina apetala var. capillaris, commonly known as moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers in spring, which are clustered in small umbels. It is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticulture.</p>
