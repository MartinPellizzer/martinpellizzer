<p>Senegalia gaumeri, commonly known as the desert shrub or gaumer's acacia, is a drought-tolerant plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which can remain on the plant for extended periods before dispersing.</p>
<p>Senegalia gaumeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for desert wildlife.</p>
