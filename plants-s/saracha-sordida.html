                    <h1>Saracha sordida</h1>
<p>Saracha sordida, commonly known as the black lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black or dark green thallus, which is typically covered in a dense layer of tiny, rounded lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to thrive on rocks and tree bark in temperate and boreal regions. Saracha sordida is often found in shaded, humid environments and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
