                    <h1>Scirpus bellardii</h1>
<p>Scirpus bellardii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers that appear in late summer to early fall. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Scirpus bellardii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
