                    <h1>Sempervivum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum spathulatum, commonly known as the bear's paw plant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has earned it the common name "perennial sorrow," reflecting its resilience and long lifespan.</p>
