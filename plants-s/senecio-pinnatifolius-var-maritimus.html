<p>Senecio pinnatifolius var. maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid environment.

It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a resilient plant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
