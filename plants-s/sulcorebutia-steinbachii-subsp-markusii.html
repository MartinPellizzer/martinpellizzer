<p>Sulcorebutia steinbachii subsp.</p>
<p>markusii, commonly known as the Markus Sulcorebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, adorned with small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a tendency to form dense clumps. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in flower color and stem morphology compared to the typical form.</p>
