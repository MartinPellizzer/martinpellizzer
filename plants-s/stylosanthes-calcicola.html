<p>Stylosanthes calcicola, commonly known as the limestone stylosanthes, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil stabilization and forage in dry climates. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, and the plant is often found growing on rocky or calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Stylosanthes calcicola is also cultivated as a legume for livestock feed due to its nutritional value and hardiness.</p>
