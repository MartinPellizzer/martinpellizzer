                    <h1>Selaginella martensii var. compacta</h1>
<p>Selaginella martensii var. compacta, commonly known as the compact spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a rosette-like structure with dense, scale-like leaves that form a tight, compact appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
