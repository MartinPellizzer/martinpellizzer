                    <h1>Stellaria pubescens</h1>
<p>Stellaria pubescens, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Stellaria pubescens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
