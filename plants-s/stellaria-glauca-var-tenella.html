                    <h1>Stellaria glauca var. tenella</h1>
<p>Stellaria glauca var. tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a bluish-green hue, and the plant has a sprawling growth habit. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Stellaria glauca by its narrower leaves and more compact form.</p>
