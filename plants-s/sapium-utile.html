<p>Sapium utile, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain sticky, waxy seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
