<p>Suaeda physophora, commonly known as sea purslane, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps it retain water in arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
