                    <h1>Sabal schwarzii</h1>
<p>Sabal schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz palm, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage as a gymnosperm. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
