                    <h1>Sporobolus utilis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus utilis, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of awns on its seed heads, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus utilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
