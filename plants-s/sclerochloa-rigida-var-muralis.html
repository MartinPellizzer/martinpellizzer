                    <h1>Sclerochloa rigida var. muralis</h1>
<p>Sclerochloa rigida var. muralis, commonly known as the rigid grass or wall grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and rigid, fibrous stems that form a mat-like structure. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature.</p>
