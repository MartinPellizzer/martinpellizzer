<p>Scirpus frondosus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. Scirpus frondosus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps prevent erosion and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
