<p>Spongiocarpella potaninii, commonly known as the woolly spongiocarpella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
