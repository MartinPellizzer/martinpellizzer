                    <h1>Styphelia oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Styphelia oppositifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its dense, dark green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, which is reflected in its scientific name.</p>
<p>Styphelia oppositifolia is well adapted to the harsh coastal environment, with features that help it withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
