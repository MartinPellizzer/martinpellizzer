                    <h1>Solanum sodiroi var. dimorphophyllum</h1>
<p>Solanum sodiroi var. dimorphophyllum, commonly known as the two-form leaf nightshade, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves, which give it its specific epithet "dimorphophyllum.". The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
