                    <h1>Sericographis heterophylla</h1>
<p>Sericographis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf sericographis, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique variability in leaf morphology, which can range from broad and elliptical to narrow and lanceolate forms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests, often as an epiphyte on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or white in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sericographis heterophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
