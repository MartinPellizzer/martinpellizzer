                    <h1>Saxifraga tremolsii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga tremolsii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga tremolsii is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
