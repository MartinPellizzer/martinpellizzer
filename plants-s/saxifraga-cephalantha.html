<p>Saxifraga cephalantha, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga cephalantha is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
