                    <h1>Sorbus evansii</h1>
<p>Sorbus evansii, commonly known as the Evans' whitebeam, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded crown, smooth bark, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Sorbus evansii is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
