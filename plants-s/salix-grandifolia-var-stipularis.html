                    <h1>Salix grandifolia var. stipularis</h1>
<p>Salix grandifolia var. stipularis, commonly known as the stipular willow, is a variant of the broadleaf willow native to parts of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
