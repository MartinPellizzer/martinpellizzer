                    <h1>Spartina patens var. juncea</h1>
<p>Spartina patens var. juncea, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting structures called salt glands. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Spartina patens var. juncea is also an important component of estuarine ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
