                    <h1>Sipanea pratensis f. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Sipanea pratensis f. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited meadow sipanea, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered fruits, which distinguish it from the typical form of Sipanea pratensis. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing umbellate inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions.</p>
