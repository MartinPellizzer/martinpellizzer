                    <h1>Sedum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Sedum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design.</p>
