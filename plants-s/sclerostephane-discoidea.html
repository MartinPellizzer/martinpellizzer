<p>Sclerostephane discoidea, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
