<p>Saxifraga pedemontana var. incudinensis, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
