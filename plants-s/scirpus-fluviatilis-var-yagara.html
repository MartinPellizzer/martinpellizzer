<p>Scirpus fluviatilis var. yagara, commonly known as the Yagara bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in freshwater swamps and marshes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and habitat provision for wetland species.</p>
