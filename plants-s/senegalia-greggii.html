                    <h1>Senegalia greggii</h1>
<p>Senegalia greggii, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Senegalia greggii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
