                    <h1>Stictocardia pringsheimiana</h1>
<p>Stictocardia pringsheimiana, commonly known as the Pringsheim's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually yellowish to orange-brown in color, with a granular texture that distinguishes it from other similar species. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
