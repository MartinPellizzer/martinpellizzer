                    <h1>Saxifraga × camonicana</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × camonicana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga × camonicana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>
