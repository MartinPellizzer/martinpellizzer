                <h1>Selenipedium stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Selenipedium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved selenipedium, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, pendulous flowers that resemble miniature orchids. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with a short, thick rhizome and is often found in association with other epiphytic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
