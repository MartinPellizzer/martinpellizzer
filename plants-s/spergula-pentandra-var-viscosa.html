                    <h1>Spergula pentandra var. viscosa</h1>
<p>Spergula pentandra var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture and deter herbivores. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
