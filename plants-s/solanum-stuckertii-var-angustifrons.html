                    <h1>Solanum stuckertii var. angustifrons</h1>
<p>Solanum stuckertii var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by yellow, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution.</p>
