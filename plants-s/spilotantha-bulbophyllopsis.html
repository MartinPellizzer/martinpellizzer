                    <h1>Spilotantha bulbophyllopsis</h1>
<p>Spilotantha bulbophyllopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which open at night. Its flowering period is brief and occurs only under specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spilotantha bulbophyllopsis is considered endangered and is the focus of conservation efforts.</p>
