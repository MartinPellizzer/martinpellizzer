                    <h1>Sprucea rubescens</h1>
<p>Sprucea rubescens, commonly known as the red spruce, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>
