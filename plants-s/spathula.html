                    <h1>Spathula</h1>
<p>Spathula, commonly known as the spathe or spathulate leaf, is a botanical term describing a leaf shape that is broad and flat, often with a rounded or slightly pointed tip.</p>
<p>This leaf morphology is typically associated with certain plant families, such as the Araceae, where it is often modified into a large, showy structure. The spathe can serve as a protective covering for the true flowers, which are often small and clustered within. It is also sometimes used in horticulture to describe the shape of leaves in ornamental plants.</p>
<p>The term is derived from the Greek word "spatha," meaning a shield, due to the broad, protective nature of the leaf.</p>
