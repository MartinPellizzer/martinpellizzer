<p>Stenocline tomentosula, commonly known as the woolly stenocline, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its dense, woolly foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to specific alpine regions where it thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs that help insulate it from harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale pink, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
