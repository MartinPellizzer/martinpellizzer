                <h1>Styphelia retrorsa</h1>
<p>Styphelia retrorsa, commonly known as the backward-stalked wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath or heather family, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a dense cover that helps protect the plant from harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Styphelia retrorsa is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in damp, shaded environments along the shoreline.</p>
