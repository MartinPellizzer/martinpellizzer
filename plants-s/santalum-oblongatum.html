                    <h1>Santalum oblongatum</h1>
<p>Santalum oblongatum, commonly known as the oblong sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic, durable timber used in furniture and incense.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy soils in coastal or subtropical regions.</p>
