<p>Spiroloba bigemina, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that is typically green or yellowish in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has structures called rhizoids for anchoring. Spiroloba bigemina thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or damp rocks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often found in clusters along the thallus.</p>
