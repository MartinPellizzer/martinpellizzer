<p>Saccolabium pumilio, commonly known as the small-leaved burr legume, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain its seeds. Its leaves are simple and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
