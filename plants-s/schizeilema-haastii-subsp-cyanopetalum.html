<p>Schizeilema haastii subsp.</p>
<p>cyanopetalum, commonly known as the blue-petaled schizeilema, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet petals, which are unusual for the genus.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
