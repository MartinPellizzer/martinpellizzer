                    <h1>Salicornia glauca</h1>
<p>Salicornia glauca, commonly known as glasswort, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces tiny, green or red flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important species in ecosystems where other plants cannot survive.</p>
<p>Salicornia glauca is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible salt-rich leaves.</p>
