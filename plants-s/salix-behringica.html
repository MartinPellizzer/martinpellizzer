                    <h1>Salix behringica</h1>
<p>Salix behringica, commonly known as the Bering willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring before the leaves fully develop. Salix behringica is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native environments.</p>
