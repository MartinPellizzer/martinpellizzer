                    <h1>Serrafalcus briziformis</h1>
<p>Serrafalcus briziformis, commonly known as the featherleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and have a serrated edge, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Serrafalcus briziformis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
