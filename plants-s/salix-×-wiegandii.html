<p>Salix × wiegandii, commonly known as the Weigand's willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, native to parts of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
