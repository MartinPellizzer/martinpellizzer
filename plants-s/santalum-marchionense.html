                    <h1>Santalum marchionense</h1>
<p>Santalum marchionense, commonly known as the Darwin's sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
