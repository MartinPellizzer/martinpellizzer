<p>Sedum bupleuroides, commonly known as the blue stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an excellent addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
