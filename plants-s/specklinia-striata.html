<p>Specklinia striata, commonly known as the streaked miniature fern, is a small epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a distinctive whitish or silver streaking. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Specklinia striata is popular among orchid and fern enthusiasts due to its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation under the right conditions.</p>
