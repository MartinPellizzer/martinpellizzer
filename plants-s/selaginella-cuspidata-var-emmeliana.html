                    <h1>Selaginella cuspidata var. emmeliana</h1>
<p>Selaginella cuspidata var. emmeliana, commonly known as the Emmelian spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing vascular plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
