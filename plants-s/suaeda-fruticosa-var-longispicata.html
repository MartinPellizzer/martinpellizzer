<p>Suaeda fruticosa var. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined saltbush, is a shrub adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, and its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is native to regions such as the Arabian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it suitable for coastal and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>The long, bristly bracts that surround the flowers are a distinctive botanical feature.</p>
