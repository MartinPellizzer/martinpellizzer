                    <h1>Stubendorffia gracilis</h1>
<p>Stubendorffia gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Stubendorffia gracilis is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams where it thrives in consistently wet conditions.</p>
