<p>Solanum tubiflorum, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a flowering plant in the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its hairy stems and violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the toxic alkaloid solanin. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates.</p>
<p>While it has historical uses in traditional medicine, it is generally considered a weed due to its invasive nature.</p>
