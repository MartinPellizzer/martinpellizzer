<p>Semiliquidambar chingii var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed Chinese sandalwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in Chinese culture. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
