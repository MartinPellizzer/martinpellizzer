                <h1>Stuckenia fennica</h1>
<p>Stuckenia fennica, commonly known as the Finnish water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Stuckenia fennica plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
