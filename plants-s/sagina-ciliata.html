<p>Sagina ciliata, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Sagina ciliata is often found in meadows, streambanks, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
