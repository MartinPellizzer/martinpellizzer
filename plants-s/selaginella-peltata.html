<p>Selaginella peltata, commonly known as the basket fern or lacy spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. Selaginella peltata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
