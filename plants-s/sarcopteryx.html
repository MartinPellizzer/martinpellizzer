                    <h1>Sarcopteryx</h1>
<p>Sarcopteryx, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on specialized structures called rhizomes to absorb nutrients from the water. It thrives in swampy environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat, making it vulnerable to environmental disturbances.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Sarcopteryx is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
