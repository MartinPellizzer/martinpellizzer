<p>Silene borysthenica subsp.</p>
<p>parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
