                    <h1>Stapelia indocta</h1>
<p>Stapelia indocta, commonly known as the "Carrion Flower," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. Its flowers open in the evening and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Stapelia indocta is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
