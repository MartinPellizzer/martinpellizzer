                    <h1>Salicornia australis</h1>
<p>Salicornia australis, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, which help minimize surface area for evaporation.</p>
<p>Salicornia australis is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats around the world.</p>
