<p>Scrophularia aquatica f. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate water scrophularia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves with distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) bases, which help in water retention. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple tubular flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, clay soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wet garden settings.</p>
