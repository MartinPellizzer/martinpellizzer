<p>Swartzia bracteata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
