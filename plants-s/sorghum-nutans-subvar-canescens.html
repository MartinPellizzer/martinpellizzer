                    <h1>Sorghum nutans subvar. canescens</h1>
<p>Sorghum nutans subvar. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaf surfaces and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its forage value and adaptability to semi-arid environments.</p>
