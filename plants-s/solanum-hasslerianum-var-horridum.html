<p>Solanum hasslerianum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough, sometimes prickly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic compounds, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
