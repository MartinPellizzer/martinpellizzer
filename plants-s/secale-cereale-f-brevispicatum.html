                    <h1>Secale cereale f. brevispicatum</h1>
<p>Secale cereale f. brevispicatum, commonly known as the short-spined rye, is a botanical variant of rye characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter spikelets.</p>
<p>This form exhibits reduced spikelet length compared to typical rye, which may influence its agronomic performance and seed dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in temperate climates. The plant's morphology includes narrow leaves and a dense, bushy appearance, making it distinguishable from other rye varieties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it of interest in both ecological studies and agricultural research.</p>
