                    <h1>Salix bangongensis</h1>
<p>Salix bangongensis, commonly known as the Bangong River willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins as its primary reproductive structures, typical of willow species, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found near streams and lakes in alpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations to cold and arid conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
