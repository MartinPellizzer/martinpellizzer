                    <h1>Scorpius juniperiformis</h1>
<p>Scorpius juniperiformis, commonly known as the spiky juniper, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that resembles the structure of a juniper.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant's leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in tight clusters, providing a protective layer against desiccation. Scorpius juniperiformis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
