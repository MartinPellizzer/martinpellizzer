<p>Saxifraga dichotoma subsp.</p>
<p>albarracinensis, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its horticultural value and is often cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental appearance.</p>
