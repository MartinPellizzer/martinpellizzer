                    <h1>Seseli</h1>
<p>Seseli, commonly known as hemlock, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Seseli species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's name is derived from the Greek word "seselos," meaning "to be sickly," possibly due to its toxic properties.</p>
<p>Some species of Seseli contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
