                    <h1>Salix lasiolepis var. braceliniae</h1>
<p>Salix lasiolepis var. braceliniae, commonly known as the Bracelinia willow, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, fuzzy underside, which gives the plant its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils.</p>
