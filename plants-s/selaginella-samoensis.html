                    <h1>Selaginella samoensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with distinct, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
