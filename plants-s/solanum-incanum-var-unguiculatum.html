<p>Solanum incanum var. unguiculatum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and requires caution during handling.</p>
