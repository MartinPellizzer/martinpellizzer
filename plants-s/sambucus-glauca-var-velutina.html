                    <h1>Sambucus glauca var. velutina</h1>
<p>Sambucus glauca var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by purple-black berries in the summer. These berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their high toxicity when unripe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
