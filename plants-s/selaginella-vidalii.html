                    <h1>Selaginella vidalii</h1>
<p>Selaginella vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are typical of the spore-bearing plants in the genus Selaginella. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in arid conditions makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant resilience and adaptation.</p>
