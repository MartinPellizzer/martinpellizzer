                    <h1>Sesamoides canescens var. alpina</h1>
<p>Sesamoides canescens var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sesamoid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth form and hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid, cold conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions across the European Alps and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
