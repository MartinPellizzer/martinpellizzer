<p>Schomburgkia brysiana var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered spider lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to reddish-pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so caution is necessary when handling it.</p>
