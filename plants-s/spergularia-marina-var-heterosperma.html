                    <h1>Spergularia marina var. heterosperma</h1>
<p>Spergularia marina var. heterosperma, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize coastal dunes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its genetic diversity and ecological resilience in coastal ecosystems.</p>
