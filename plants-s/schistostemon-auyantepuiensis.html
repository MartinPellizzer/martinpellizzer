<p>Schistostemon auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Pem√≥n arrowleaf, is a rare plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers. The plant thrives in the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the tepui summits. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with low temperatures and high UV exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
