<p>Stichorkis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant's thallus is typically pale to dark grey, and it lacks distinct lobes or pores. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions with high mineral content in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
