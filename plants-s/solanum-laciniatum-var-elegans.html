                    <h1>Solanum laciniatum var. elegans</h1>
<p>Solanum laciniatum var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant nightshade, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely lobed, dark green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces berries that mature to a vivid red, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties.</p>
