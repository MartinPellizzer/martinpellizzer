                    <h1>Santalum involutum</h1>
<p>Santalum involutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its aromatic wood has been historically valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important species in certain ecosystems.</p>
