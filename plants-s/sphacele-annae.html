<p>Sphacele annae, commonly known as the Annas' blushing bell, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphacele annae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
