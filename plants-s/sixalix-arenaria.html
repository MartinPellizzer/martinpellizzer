<p>Sixalix arenaria, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
