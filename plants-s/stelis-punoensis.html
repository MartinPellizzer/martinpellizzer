<p>Stelis punoensis, commonly known as the Puno orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
