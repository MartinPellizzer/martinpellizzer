                    <h1>Samara guianensis</h1>
<p>Samara guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan samara, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and produces distinctive capsule fruits that split open to release its seeds. The seeds are encased in a papery, winged structure called a samara, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows the plant to spread its seeds effectively across its natural habitat.</p>
