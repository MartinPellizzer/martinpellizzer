<p>Scorpiurus muricatus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with pale green, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in small, spherical heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
