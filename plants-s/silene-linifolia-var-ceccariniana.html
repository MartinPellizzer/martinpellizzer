                    <h1>Silene linifolia var. ceccariniana</h1>
<p>Silene linifolia var. ceccariniana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
