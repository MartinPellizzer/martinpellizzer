                    <h1>Serpocaulon levigatum</h1>
<p>Serpocaulon levigatum, commonly known as the smooth serpocaulon, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flat body that absorbs nutrients directly from the substrate. It is often found in rocky crevices or on the bark of trees in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and specialized habitat, it is relatively uncommon and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
