                    <h1>Savia platyrachis</h1>
<p>Savia platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leafed spurge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
