                    <h1>Sorghum eplicatum var. fiorii</h1>
<p>Sorghum eplicatum var. fiorii, commonly known as the pink-flowered sorghum, is a striking variant of the sorghum genus native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink to purple inflorescences, which distinguish it from typical green sorghum varieties. The plant is a tall grass with narrow, blade-like leaves and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it shares the drought tolerance and adaptability typical of other sorghum species.</p>
