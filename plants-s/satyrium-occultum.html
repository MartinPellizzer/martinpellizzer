                    <h1>Satyrium occultum</h1>
<p>Satyrium occultum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and small, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the bases of trees in pine flatwoods or cypress swamps. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Satyrium occultum is considered critically endangered in many regions.</p>
