<p>Sophia sagittata f. communis, commonly known as the common arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically floating or emergent, depending on the water conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
