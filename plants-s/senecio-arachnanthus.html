<p>Senecio arachnanthus, commonly known as the spider plant or ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and easy to care for.</p>
