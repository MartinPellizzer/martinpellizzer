                    <h1>Statice plantaginea var. microcepahala</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Statice plantaginea var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf statice, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a low-growing habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting flowers, which are often used in dried flower arrangements.</p>
