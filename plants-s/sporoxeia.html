<p>Sporoxeia, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a type of primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Microsorum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and the presence of sporangia, which produce spores for reproduction. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Sporoxeia has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>Its structure includes a stem with whorled leaves and a root system adapted for anchoring in soil.</p>
