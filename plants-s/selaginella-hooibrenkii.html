                    <h1>Selaginella hooibrenkii</h1>
<p>Selaginella hooibrenkii, commonly known as the Hooibrenk's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to the humid, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and evolutionary significance make it an important subject in the study of plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species.</p>
