                    <h1>Sclerolobium myrmecophilum</h1>
<p>Sclerolobium myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-loving acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorned branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are highly attractive to ants. It forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which live in the hollow thorns and protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation makes it an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>
