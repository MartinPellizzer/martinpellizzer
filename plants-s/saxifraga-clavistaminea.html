                    <h1>Saxifraga clavistaminea</h1>
<p>Saxifraga clavistaminea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Saxifraga clavistaminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult terrain.</p>
