                    <h1>Sarracenia purpurea f. luteola</h1>
<p>Sarracenia purpurea f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture insects. The plant's foliage is typically a vibrant yellow to orange-red, which distinguishes it from the more commonly known purple form. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This carnivorous plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
