<p>Saxifraga nelsoniana subsp.</p>
<p>reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of oval, waxy leaves that are typically kidney-shaped, giving it its common name.</p>
