                            <h1>Salsola Kali Var. Vulgaris</h1>
<p>Russian thistle, scientifically known as Salsola kali var. vulgaris, is a widespread invasive plant native to Eurasia. It is commonly referred to as goatweed or tumbleweed due to its distinctive, wind-dispersed seed capsules. This plant thrives in arid and disturbed environments, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a significant ecological challenge. Despite its noxious reputation, it has adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>
