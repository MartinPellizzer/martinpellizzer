                    <h1>Schisandra cauliflora</h1>
<p>Schisandra cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain five-flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers emerge directly from the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are edible and have a distinctive flavor. Schisandra cauliflora is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
