<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery leaves that resemble a tongue, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant is a spore-bearing species, reproducing through the production of microspores and megaspores rather than seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Selaginella rothertii is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
