                    <h1>Stenoloma aculeatum</h1>
<p>Stenoloma aculeatum, commonly known as the spiky fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, spiky fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention.</p>
