                    <h1>Schismatoglottis pumila</h1>
<p>Schismatoglottis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf schismatoglottis, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique floral structure, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
