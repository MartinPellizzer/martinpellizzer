                    <h1>Sorghum provinciale</h1>
<p>Sorghum provinciale, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a robust annual grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and upright stems, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are often pale green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sorghum provinciale is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
