                    <h1>Sabulina patula</h1>
<p>Sabulina patula, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Sabulina patula is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
