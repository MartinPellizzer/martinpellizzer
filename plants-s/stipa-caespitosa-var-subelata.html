<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, forming compact clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue due to the fine, silky hairs covering the foliage.

<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its elegant appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
