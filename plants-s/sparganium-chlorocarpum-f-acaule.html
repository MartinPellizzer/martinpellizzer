                    <h1>Sparganium chlorocarpum f. acaule</h1>
<p>Sparganium chlorocarpum f. acaule, commonly known as the slender bur reed, is a rare and distinctive aquatic plant characterized by its reduced stem structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially emergent. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, forming dense clusters around the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its lack of a prominent above-water stem, distinguishing it from other forms of Sparganium.</p>
