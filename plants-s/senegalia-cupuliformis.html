<p>Senegalia cupuliformis, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown of branches and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small and feathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Senegalia cupuliformis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
