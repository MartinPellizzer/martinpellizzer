                    <h1>Stichoneuron membranaceum</h1>
<p>Stichoneuron membranaceum, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a primitive aquatic plant belonging to the order Psilophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the conventional sense, instead having a stem-like axis with spirally arranged sporangia. It thrives in freshwater environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its fossil record provides important insights into the early evolution of vascular plants.</p>
