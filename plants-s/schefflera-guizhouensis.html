<p>Schefflera guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou Schefflera, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Guizhou Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
