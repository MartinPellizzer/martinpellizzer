                    <h1>Sulitra</h1>
<p>Sulitra, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a striking species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, waxy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Sulitra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
