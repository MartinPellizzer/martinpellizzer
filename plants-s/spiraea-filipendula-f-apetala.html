                    <h1>Spiraea filipendula f. apetala</h1>
<p>Spiraea filipendula f. apetala, commonly known as the sterile form of meadow spiraea, is a variation of the meadow spiraea species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of flowers, which distinguishes it from the typical form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique floral absence and its role in ecological habitats.</p>
