                    <h1>Saxifraga porophylla var. montenegrina</h1>
<p>Saxifraga porophylla var. montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically silver-white or grayish in color, adapted to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
