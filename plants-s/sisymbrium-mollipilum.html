<p>Sisymbrium mollipilum, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a concern for agricultural crops.</p>
