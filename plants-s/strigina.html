                    <h1>Strigina</h1>
<p>Strigina, commonly known as the "ghost grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often pale or whitish appearance, which gives them their ethereal look. Strigina species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats. They have narrow leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to their low-growing habit and unique appearance, Strigina species are often considered weedy and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
