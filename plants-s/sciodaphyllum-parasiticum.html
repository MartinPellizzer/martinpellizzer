                    <h1>Sciodaphyllum parasiticum</h1>
<p>Sciodaphyllum parasiticum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It typically attaches itself to the roots of other plants, forming a symbiotic relationship that can be detrimental to its host. The plant's structure is simple, consisting of a root system and a leafy frond that resembles a fern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a complex role in ecosystem dynamics, influencing both plant communities and nutrient cycles.</p>
