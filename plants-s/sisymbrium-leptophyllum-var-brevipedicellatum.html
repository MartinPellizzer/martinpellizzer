                    <h1>Sisymbrium leptophyllum var. brevipedicellatum</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium leptophyllum var. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on parasitic relationships with host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and exhibits a root system that forms haustoria to penetrate the vascular system of its host. The plant typically has a prostrate or ascending growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are yellow and occur in racemose inflorescences, though the plant is mostly known for its parasitic nature rather than its floral display.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
