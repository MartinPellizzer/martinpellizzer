                    <h1>Semenovia pulvinata</h1>
<p>Semenovia pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in a single cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
