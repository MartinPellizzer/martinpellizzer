<p>Systrepha multiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
