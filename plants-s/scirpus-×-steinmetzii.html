                    <h1>Scirpus × steinmetzii</h1>
<p>Scirpus × steinmetzii, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Scirpus maritimus and Scirpus validus.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color, and it thrives in saline or brackish environments. Scirpus × steinmetzii plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects a blend of traits from its hybrid origins, making it a notable species in coastal and marsh ecosystems.</p>
