                    <h1>Selenothamnus</h1>
<p>Selenothamnus, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Selenothamnus species typically have upright growth habits and produce small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to yellow.</p>
<p>They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
