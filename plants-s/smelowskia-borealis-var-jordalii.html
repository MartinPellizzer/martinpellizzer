                    <h1>Smelowskia borealis var. jordalii</h1>
<p>Smelowskia borealis var. jordalii, commonly known as the Northern Borealis variant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and possesses small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the brief summer months, which are adapted to attract pollinators in cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is highly sensitive to temperature changes, making it an indicator species for climate shifts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental disturbances.</p>
