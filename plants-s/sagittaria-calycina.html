                    <h1>Sagittaria calycina</h1>
<p>Sagittaria calycina, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>Sagittaria calycina plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
