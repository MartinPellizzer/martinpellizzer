<p>Senegalia recurva, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, often spiraling branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Senegalia recurva is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
