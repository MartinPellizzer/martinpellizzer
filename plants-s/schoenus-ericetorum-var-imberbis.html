                    <h1>Schoenus ericetorum var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Schoenus ericetorum var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless moorgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the wetlands and heaths of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that lack the dense hair found in the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
