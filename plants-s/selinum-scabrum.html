<p>Selinum scabrum, commonly known as rough stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Selinum scabrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
