<p>Spergularia firma, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in coastal environments, particularly in sandy or shingle shores. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, and its leaves are usually linear and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions. It is often found in the intertidal zone, where it tolerates regular exposure to salt spray and fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Spergularia firma plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
