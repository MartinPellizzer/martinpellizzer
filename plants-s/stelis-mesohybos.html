                    <h1>Stelis mesohybos</h1>
<p>Stelis mesohybos, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Stelis, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in racemes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis mesohybos is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
