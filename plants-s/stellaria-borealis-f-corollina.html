<p>Stellaria borealis f. corollina, commonly known as the Arctic starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
