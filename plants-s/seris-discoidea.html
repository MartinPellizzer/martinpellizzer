                    <h1>Seris discoidea</h1>
<p>Seris discoidea, commonly known as the disc-shaped seris, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, disc-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Seris discoidea plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution.</p>
