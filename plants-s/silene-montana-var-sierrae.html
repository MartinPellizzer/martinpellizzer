<p>Silene montana var. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
