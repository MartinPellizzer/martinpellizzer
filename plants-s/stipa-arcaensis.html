<p>Stipa arcaensis, commonly known as the Arcaen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa arcaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
