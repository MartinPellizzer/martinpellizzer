<p>Scyphogyne inconspicua var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth scyphogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves are notable features that set it apart from other varieties of Scyphogyne.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
