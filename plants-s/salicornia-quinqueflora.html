<p>Salicornia quinqueflora, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often red or pink in color. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is typically dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Salicornia quinqueflora is also known for its edible stems, which are rich in minerals and have been used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
