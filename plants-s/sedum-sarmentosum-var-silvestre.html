<p>[WRONG START] Sedum sarmentosos var. silvestre, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
