                    <h1>Salcedoa</h1>
<p>Salcedoa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Salcedoa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and roots make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
