<p>Styphelia malayana var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea styphelia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
