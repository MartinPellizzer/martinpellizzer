                    <h1>Staurostigma luschnathianum</h1>
<p>Staurostigma luschnathianum, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, star-like thallus structure, which is composed of tightly packed, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus and are involved in sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Staurostigma luschnathianum is an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats.</p>
