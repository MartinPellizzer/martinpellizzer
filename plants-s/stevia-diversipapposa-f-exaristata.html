                    <h1>Stevia diversipapposa f. exaristata</h1>
<p>Stevia diversipapposa f. exaristata, commonly known as the exaristate stevia, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the stevia genus.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. This plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. It is valued for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, making it a potential natural sweetener.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation efforts.</p>
