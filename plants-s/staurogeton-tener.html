<p>Staurogeton tener, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Staurogeton tener is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
