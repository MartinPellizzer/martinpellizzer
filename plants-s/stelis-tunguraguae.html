<p>Stelis tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
