<p>Suaeda corniculata var. olufsenii, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and arid regions where it tolerates high salinity and low moisture. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss and store moisture. Its yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
