<p>Salix eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. The plant features slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of the Salix genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Eastwood's willow is considered a conservation concern.</p>
