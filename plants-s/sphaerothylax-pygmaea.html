                    <h1>Sphaerothylax pygmaea</h1>
<p>Sphaerothylax pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf star cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in small, cylindrical spines, giving it a unique, star-like appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
