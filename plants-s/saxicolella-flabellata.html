<p>Saxicolella flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky habitats, where it forms dense mats on soil and stone. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals arranged in a flabellate (fan-like) shape. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
