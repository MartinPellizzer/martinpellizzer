                    <h1>Santalum insulare</h1>
<p>Santalum insulare, commonly known as the island sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments and has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive scent.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
