<p>Selaginella sungemagneana, commonly known as the sungemagnean spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a stem with whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper part of the stem and contain the spore-producing organs.</p>
