                    <h1>Sympegma regelii</h1>
<p>Sympegma regelii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and rosette-forming leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Sympegma regelii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh climates.</p>
