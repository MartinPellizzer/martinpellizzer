                    <h1>Salacia whytei</h1>
<p>Salacia whytei, commonly known as the Whyte's salacia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Salacia whytei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
