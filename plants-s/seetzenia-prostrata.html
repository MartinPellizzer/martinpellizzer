<p>Seetzenia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate setaria, is a low-growing annual grass species native to parts of Asia.</p>

The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can be a persistent weed in certain environments.</p>
