                    <h1>Salmalia scopulorum</h1>
<p>Salmalia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock almond, is a small deciduous tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, almond-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Salmalia scopulorum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry landscapes.</p>
