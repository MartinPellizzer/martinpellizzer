                    <h1>Sedum nevii var. beyrichianum</h1>
<p>Sedum nevii var. beyrichianum, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at elevations above 1,000 meters.</p>
