                    <h1>Salvia whitehousei var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Salvia whitehousei var. parviflora, commonly known as Whitehouse's sage, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, pale blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a unique component of local ecosystems and its value in botanical research.</p>
