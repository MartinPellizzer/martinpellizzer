<p>Stelis norae, commonly known as the Norae's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with a unique coloration, often featuring a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis norae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
