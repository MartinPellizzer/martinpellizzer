                    <h1>Silene polaris</h1>
<p>Silene polaris, commonly known as the polar catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain heat in its cold environment. Silene polaris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its harsh ecosystem.</p>
