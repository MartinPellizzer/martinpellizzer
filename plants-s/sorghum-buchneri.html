                    <h1>Sorghum buchneri</h1>
<p>Sorghum buchneri, commonly known as bio sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust stem and large, narrow leaves, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for marginal lands. It is particularly valued for its high biomass yield and its ability to produce a significant amount of fermentable sugars.</p>
<p>Sorghum buchneri is widely used in biofuel production and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
