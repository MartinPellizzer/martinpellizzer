<p>Saxifraga pensylvanica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a cyme. It thrives in rocky, moist habitats and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to its environment, with a compact growth form that helps it survive in shaded, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
