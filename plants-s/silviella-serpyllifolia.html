                    <h1>Silviella serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Silviella serpyllifolia, commonly known as field scurvy grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish or white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Silviella serpyllifolia is known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat scurvy due to its high vitamin C content.</p>
