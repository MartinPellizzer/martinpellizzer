<p>It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it a valuable forage crop. Its rapid growth and high biomass production make it suitable for erosion control and livestock feed.</p>
<p>The seeds, while not typically consumed by humans, are used in some traditional applications.</p>
