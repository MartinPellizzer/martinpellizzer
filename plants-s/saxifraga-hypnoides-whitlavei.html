<p>Saxifraga hypnoides whitlavei, commonly known as the Whitlave's saxifrage, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
