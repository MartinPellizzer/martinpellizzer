                    <h1>Senecio rhopalophyllus</h1>
<p>Senecio rhopalophyllus, commonly known as the silver leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cylindrical shape, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
