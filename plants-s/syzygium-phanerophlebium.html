<p>Syzygium phanerophlebium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The tree produces small, white or pink flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is typically smooth and reddish in color.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
