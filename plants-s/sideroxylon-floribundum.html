                    <h1>Sideroxylon floribundum</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon floribundum, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stress and pests.</p>
<p>Sideroxylon floribundum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its durable wood.</p>
