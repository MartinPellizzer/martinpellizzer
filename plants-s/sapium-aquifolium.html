                    <h1>Sapium aquifolium</h1>
<p>Sapium aquifolium, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize water sediments and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Sapium aquifolium is also valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in many Asian traditions.</p>
