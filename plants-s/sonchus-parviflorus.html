<p>Sonchus parviflorus, commonly known as the smallflower sow-thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are edible but have a slightly bitter taste, and the plant is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
<p>Sonchus parviflorus has been used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
