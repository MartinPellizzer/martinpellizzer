                    <h1>Sporobolus farinosus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus farinosus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sand dropseed is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
