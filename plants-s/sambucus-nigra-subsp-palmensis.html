                    <h1>Sambucus nigra subsp. palmensis</h1>
<p>Sambucus nigra subsp.</p>
<p>palmensis, commonly known as the palmleaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it its common name, and its clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that appear in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dark purple berries in late summer, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
