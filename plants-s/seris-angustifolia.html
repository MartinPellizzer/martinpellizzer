                    <h1>Seris angustifolia</h1>
<p>Seris angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf seris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Seris angustifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
