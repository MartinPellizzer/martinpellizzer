                    <h1>Salsola obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Salsola obtusifolia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water requirements. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common invasive species in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Salsola obtusifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils in disturbed areas but can also be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
