<p>Sambucus racemosa f. dissecta, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often appear fern-like, giving it the "dissecta" designation. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and wildlife.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
