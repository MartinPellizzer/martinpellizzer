<p>Setaria pseudoverticillata, commonly known as false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, thread-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
