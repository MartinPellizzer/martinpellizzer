                    <h1>Schoenoplectus javanus</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus javanus, commonly known as the Java bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus javanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
