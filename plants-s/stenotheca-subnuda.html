                    <h1>Stenotheca subnuda</h1>
<p>Stenotheca subnuda, commonly known as the naked-stalked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems that often bear small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Stenotheca subnuda is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
