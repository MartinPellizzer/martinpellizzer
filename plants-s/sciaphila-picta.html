                    <h1>Sciaphila picta</h1>
<p>Sciaphila picta, commonly known as the picta ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its cryptic nature, Sciaphila picta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
