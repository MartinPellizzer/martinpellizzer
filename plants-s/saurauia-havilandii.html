                    <h1>Saurauia havilandii</h1>
<p>Saurauia havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Saurauia havilandii is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
