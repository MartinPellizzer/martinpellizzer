                    <h1>Sciaphila mwanihanensis</h1>
<p>Sciaphila mwanihanensis, commonly known as the Mwanihana ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season, adding to its ethereal appearance. Sciaphila mwanihanensis is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
