                    <h1>Salsola glabrescens var. apiculata</h1>
<p>Salsola glabrescens var. apiculata, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, sour-tasting berries that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in saline soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a common component of desert vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
