                    <h1>Sedum arenarium</h1>
<p>Sedum arenarium, commonly known as desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
