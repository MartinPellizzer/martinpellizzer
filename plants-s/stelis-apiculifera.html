<p>Stelis apiculifera, commonly known as the apiculate stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple.</p>
<p>Stelis apiculifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth.</p>
