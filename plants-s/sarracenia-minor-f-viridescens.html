                    <h1>Sarracenia minor f. viridescens</h1>
<p>Sarracenia minor f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-flowered mosquito hawk, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a variant of Sarracenia minor, characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form pitchers to trap insects. The foliage of this form exhibits a distinctive green hue, differing from the typical red or orange tones of the species. Its pitchers are narrow and often have a waxy texture, aiding in the adhesion of prey.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration and growth.</p>
