<p>Salsola androssowii subsp.</p>
<p>deserticola, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access underground water. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
