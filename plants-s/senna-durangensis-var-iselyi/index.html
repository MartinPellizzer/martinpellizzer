                            <h1>Senna Durangensis Var. Iselyi</h1>
<p>Senna durangensis var. iselyi is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family and is known for its unique yellow flowers and feathery foliage. This variant is particularly adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats of extinction, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
