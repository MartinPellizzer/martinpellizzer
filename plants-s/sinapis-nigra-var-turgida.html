<p>Sinapis nigra var. turgida, commonly known as the inflated mustard, is a variant of the wild mustard plant characterized by its swollen, pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features alternate, pinnately compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the inflated, three-lobed siliqua (pod) that remains on the plant well into the winter.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
