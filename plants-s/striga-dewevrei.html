                    <h1>Striga dewevrei</h1>
<p>Striga dewevrei, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is notorious for causing significant agricultural losses in sub-Saharan Africa. Its life cycle is closely tied to the host's growth, and it can persist in the soil for years as dormant seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, Striga dewevrei remains a major challenge for sustainable farming in affected regions.</p>
