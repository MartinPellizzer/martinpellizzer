                    <h1>Stictophyllorchis</h1>
<p>Stictophyllorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Stictophyllorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
