                    <h1>Suberanthus hincheanus</h1>
<p>Suberanthus hincheanus, commonly known as the Hinc√©an suberbush, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are opposite and often have a glossy surface, while its stems are covered in a thick, cork-like layer.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature helps it retain moisture in its often arid native habitat.</p>
