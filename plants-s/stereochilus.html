                    <h1>Stereochilus</h1>
<p>Stereochilus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique floral structures and adaptations to rocky or arid environments. Stereochilus species typically have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce intricate, often fragrant flowers with specialized pollination mechanisms. They are found primarily in regions with limestone or rocky substrates, such as parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Stereochilus species are rare or endangered.</p>
