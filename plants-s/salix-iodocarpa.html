                    <h1>Salix iodocarpa</h1>
<p>Salix iodocarpa, commonly known as the iodine willow, is a species of shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Its leaves contain high concentrations of iodine, which gives it its common name and makes it unique among willow species.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
