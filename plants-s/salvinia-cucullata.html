                    <h1>Salvinia cucullata</h1>
<p>Salvinia cucullata, commonly known as the shield-leaf watermoss, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are adventitious, allowing it to anchor itself to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Salvinia cucullata is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to significant ecological impacts in invaded water bodies.</p>
