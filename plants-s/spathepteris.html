                    <h1>Spathepteris</h1>
<p>Spathepteris, commonly known as the false water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive fronds, which are usually bipinnate and have a leathery texture. Spathepteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
