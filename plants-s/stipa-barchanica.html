<p>Stipa barchanica, commonly known as the Barchan grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Stipa barchanica plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
