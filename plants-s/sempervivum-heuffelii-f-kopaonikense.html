<p>Sempervivum heuffelii f. kopaonikense, commonly known as the Kopaonik houseleek, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves.</p>
<p>It originates from the Kopaonik mountain range in Serbia, where it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
