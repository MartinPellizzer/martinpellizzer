                    <h1>Silene otites var. borysthenica</h1>
<p>Silene otites var. borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a characteristic species of the region's dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Silene otites var. borysthenica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
