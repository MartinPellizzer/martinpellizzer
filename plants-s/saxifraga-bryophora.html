<p>Saxifraga bryophora, commonly known as the moss saxifrage, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant has a low-growing habit with a rosette of fleshy, moss-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Saxifraga bryophora is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
