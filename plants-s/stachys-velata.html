<p>Stachys velata, commonly known as velvetleaf stachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its flowering spikes that bear small, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces small, dark purple to brown seeds.</p>
<p>Stachys velata is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and modest flowering display.</p>
