<p>Sedum reflexum subsp.</p>
<p>albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
