                    <h1>Stictocardia woodii</h1>
<p>Stictocardia woodii, commonly known as the Wood's lichen, is a crustose lichen that grows on bark and rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange coloration and a smooth, leathery texture. The lichen consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which together carry out photosynthesis. It is typically found in temperate and boreal regions, often in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Stictocardia woodii is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
