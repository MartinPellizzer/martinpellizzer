<p>Senecio cespitosus, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Senecio cespitosus is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>
