                    <h1>Salix pallescens</h1>
<p>Salix pallescens, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
