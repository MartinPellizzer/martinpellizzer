                    <h1>Shivparvatia ramellata</h1>
<p>Shivparvatia ramellata, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its mossy habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shivparvatia ramellata is considered a threatened species.</p>
