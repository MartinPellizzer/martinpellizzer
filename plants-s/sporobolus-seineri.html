                    <h1>Sporobolus seineri</h1>
<p>Sporobolus seineri, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its seed heads are distinctive for their ability to disperse seeds by wind, a feature that aids in its propagation across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Sporobolus seineri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
