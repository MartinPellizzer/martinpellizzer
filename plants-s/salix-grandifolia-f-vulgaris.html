                    <h1>Salix grandifolia f. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Salix grandifolia f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, and its roots help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and often has a whitish or grayish appearance, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the plant ages.</p>
