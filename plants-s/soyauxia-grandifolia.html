                    <h1>Soyauxia grandifolia</h1>
<p>Soyauxia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Soyauxia grandifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions.</p>
