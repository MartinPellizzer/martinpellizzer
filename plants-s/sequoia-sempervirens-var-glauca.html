                    <h1>Sequoia sempervirens var. glauca</h1>
<p>Sequoia sempervirens var. glauca, commonly known as the coastal giant sequoia, is a variant of the coast redwood native to the coastal regions of Northern California and Southern Oregon.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its bluish-gray bark and shorter, more compact growth compared to the typical coast redwood. It thrives in moist, temperate climates with high rainfall and cool temperatures. The leaves are needle-like and dark green, often appearing glossy due to a waxy coating.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience to coastal conditions and its role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
