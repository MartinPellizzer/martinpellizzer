<p>Saxifraga cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.

It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Saxifraga cordifolia is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
