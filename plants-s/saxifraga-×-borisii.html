                    <h1>Saxifraga × borisii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga × borisii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
