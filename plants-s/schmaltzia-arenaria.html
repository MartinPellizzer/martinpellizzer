                    <h1>Schmaltzia arenaria</h1>
<p>Schmaltzia arenaria, commonly known as the sand-skipper or sand-skipper plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the base of the stems. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in sandy soils by anchoring it and accessing deeper water sources.</p>
<p>Schmaltzia arenaria is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
