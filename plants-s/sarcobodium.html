                    <h1>Sarcobodium</h1>
<p>Sarcobodium, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Sarcobodium species are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they form dense mats or low-growing shrubs. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their hardy nature and ornamental value, many species are cultivated as decorative plants in gardens and rockeries.</p>
