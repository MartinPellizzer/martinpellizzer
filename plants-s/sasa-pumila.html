<p>Sasa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant produces slender, cane-like stems that are often used in traditional crafts and as a decorative element. Sasa pumila thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time.</p>
