                    <h1>Selaginella tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Selaginella tenuifolia, commonly known as the 'spikemoss', is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized structures called stomata. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Selaginella tenuifolia is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, which are released from cone-like structures called strobili.</p>
