<p>Syringodea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that split into three distinct leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Syringodea triphylla is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
