                    <h1>Schinus dependens f. arenicola</h1>
<p>Schinus dependens f. arenicola, commonly known as the beach huito, is a shrub native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, red berries that serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in dune stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'arenicola' specifically refers to its adaptation to sandy habitats, distinguishing it from other forms of Schinus dependens.</p>
