<p>Salix saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>stoloniferoides, commonly known as the stoloniferous willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often creeping stems that form dense mats or low-growing colonies.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
