                    <h1>Scaphiophora</h1>
<p>Scaphiophora, commonly known as the lantern flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, tubular flowers that resemble small lanterns, often with a striking color contrast between the upper and lower petals. They are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while still performing photosynthesis. Scaphiophora species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Their floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to their ecological significance in native habitats.</p>
