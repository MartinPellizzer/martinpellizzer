                    <h1>Saccharum sorghum</h1>
<p>Saccharum sorghum, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in warm climates.</p>
<p>It has a thick, fibrous stem that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are often pink or red in color. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Sorghum is known for its high biomass and is used for forage, grain, and biofuel production.</p>
