                    <h1>Stelis maniola</h1>
<p>Stelis maniola, commonly known as the maniola orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil.</p>
<p>Stelis maniola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
