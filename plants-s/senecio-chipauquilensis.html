<p>Senecio chipauquilensis, commonly known as the Chipauquil Mountain Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
