<p>Sulcorebutia verticillacantha var. cuprea, commonly known as the copper-tipped crassula, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically a deep green with red or copper-colored markings along the edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it requires minimal watering and thrives in bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
