<p>Stellaria monantha var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often hairy.
