<p>Selliguea tenuicauda, commonly known as the slender-tailed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, or vascular tissue. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a distinct midrib, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Selliguea tenuicauda plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
