                    <h1>Salix fusca var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Salix fusca var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its growth habit is often prostrate or sprawling, making it well-suited for erosion control in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It prefers moist to wet environments and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
