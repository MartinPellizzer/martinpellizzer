                    <h1>Steenhammera stylosa</h1>
<p>Steenhammera stylosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Steenhammera stylosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
