                    <h1>Sarcomphalus punctatus</h1>
<p>Sarcomphalus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct, darkly pigmented, and often spotted thallus, which gives it its common name. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
