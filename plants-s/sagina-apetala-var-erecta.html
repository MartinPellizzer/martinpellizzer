                    <h1>Sagina apetala var. erecta</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Sagina apetila var. erecta, commonly known as upright sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is often found in coastal dunes, wet meadows, and other disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize bare ground make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'erecta' refers to its upright growth form compared to other varieties of Sagina apetala.</p>
