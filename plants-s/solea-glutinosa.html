                    <h1>Solea glutinosa</h1>
<p>Solea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky flounder, is a species of flatfish native to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a rough, slimy skin that aids in its camouflage. The fish has both eyes on the right side of its head, a characteristic feature of all flatfish. It thrives in sandy or muddy seabeds and is often found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>The plant name is actually a misnomer, as Solea glutinosa refers to a fish, not a botanical species.</p>
