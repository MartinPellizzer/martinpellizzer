                    <h1>Selago prostrata</h1>
<p>Selago prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate selago, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky substrates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Selago prostrata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
