<p>Seaforthia jaculatoria, commonly known as the seaforthia jaculatoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, providing some resistance to salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
