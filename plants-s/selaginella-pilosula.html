                    <h1>Selaginella pilosula</h1>
<p>Selaginella pilosula, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and its ability to form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella pilosula reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and ability to survive in poor soil conditions make it a common component of many forest understories.</p>
