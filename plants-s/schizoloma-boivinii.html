                    <h1>Schizoloma boivinii</h1>
<p>Schizoloma boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in humid, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
