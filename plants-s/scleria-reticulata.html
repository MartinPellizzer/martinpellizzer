<p>Scleria reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.
