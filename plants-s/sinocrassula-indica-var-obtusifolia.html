                    <h1>Sinocrassula indica var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Sinocrassula indica var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf sinocrassula, is a succulent plant native to China.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval to rounded in shape. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
