<p>It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has linear, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native environment. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit.</p>
