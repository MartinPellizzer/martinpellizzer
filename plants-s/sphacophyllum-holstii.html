                    <h1>Sphacophyllum holstii</h1>
<p>Sphacophyllum holstii, commonly known as the Holst's sphacelium, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thallus that is often prostrate or loosely cushion-like, with small, closely packed leaves. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
