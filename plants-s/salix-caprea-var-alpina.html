                    <h1>Salix caprea var. alpina</h1>
<p>Salix caprea var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas.</p>
