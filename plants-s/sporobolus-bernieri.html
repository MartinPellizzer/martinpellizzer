<p>Sporobolus bernieri, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by wind, a characteristic feature of the genus Sporobolus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus bernieri plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
