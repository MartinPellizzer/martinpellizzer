<p>Skottsbergiliana partita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often pale green or almost white, giving it its ghostly appearance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
