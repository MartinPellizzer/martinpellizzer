                    <h1>Salix sturneana</h1>
<p>Salix sturneana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and graceful look. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that shimmers in the wind. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects.</p>
<p>This species is often planted for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality.</p>
