                    <h1>Salix peraffinis</h1>
<p>Salix peraffinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers, and the leaves are usually covered in fine hairs.</p>
