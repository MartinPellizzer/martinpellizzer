                    <h1>Stisseria picta</h1>
<p>Stisseria picta, commonly known as the painted stisseria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the vibrant bracts. Stisseria picta thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
