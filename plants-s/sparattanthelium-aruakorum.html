<p>Sparattanthelium aruakorum, commonly known as the Arua Skygrass, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, feathery leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months of the year. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soil and access limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Sparattanthelium aruakorum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment.</p>
