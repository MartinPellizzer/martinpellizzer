<p>Saponaria acerosa, commonly known as the hardy soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Saponaria acerosa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy garden plant.</p>
<p>Its sap contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, hence its common name.</p>
