<p>Serapias orientalis subsp.</p>
<p>dafnii, commonly known as the Daffodil Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to harsh alpine environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
