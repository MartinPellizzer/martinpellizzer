                    <h1>Stereoxylon ciliatum</h1>
<p>Stereoxylon ciliatum, commonly known as the silky wood-fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
