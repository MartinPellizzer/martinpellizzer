<p>Streptocarpus ionanthus subsp.</p>
<p>nitidus, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
