                    <h1>Stilla</h1>
<p>Stilla, commonly known as the "flower of the desert," is a rare and resilient plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during brief periods of rainfall. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Stilla is an important indicator of ecosystem health in desert environments.</p>
