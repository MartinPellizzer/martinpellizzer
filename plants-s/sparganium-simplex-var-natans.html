                    <h1>Sparganium simplex var. natans</h1>
<p>Sparganium simplex var. natans, commonly known as the floating burr rush, is a herbaceous plant native to freshwater wetlands across Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating clusters of spiky, brownish-red fruits that remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant's stems are often submerged, with leaves that are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense mats. It plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late summer.</p>
