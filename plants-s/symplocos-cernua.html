<p>Symplocos cernua, commonly known as the drooping wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Symplocos cernua thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
