<p>Symphyandra armena, commonly known as Armenian symphyandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms that are not particularly showy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Symphyandra armena is considered a botanically significant species with conservation concerns.</p>
