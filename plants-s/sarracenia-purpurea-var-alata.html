                    <h1>Sarracenia purpurea var. alata</h1>
<p>Sarracenia purpurea var. alata, commonly known as the white-tailed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular leaves that are typically pink or red with a white or pale pink stripe along the midrib. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher-shaped leaf and are digested by enzymes. Its flowers are usually white or green and grow on a separate stem.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to wet, acidic soils and thrives in boggy environments.</p>
