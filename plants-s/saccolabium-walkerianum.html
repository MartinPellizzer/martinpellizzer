<p>Saccolabium walkerianum, commonly known as the yellow burr bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody shrub structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it is adapted to dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Saccolabium walkerianum is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
