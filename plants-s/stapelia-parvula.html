<p>Stapelia parvula, commonly known as the miniature star plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, resembling the appearance of a star. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Stapelia parvula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
