                    <h1>Spartina platensis</h1>
<p>Spartina platensis, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Atlantic coast of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has hollow, cylindrical stems and blade-like leaves, which help it withstand tidal forces and saltwater exposure. It is also an important component of salt marsh ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and bird species.</p>
<p>Spartina platensis reproduces through both seeds and rhizomes, allowing it to spread and form dense stands in its coastal environment.</p>
