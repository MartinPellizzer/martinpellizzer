                    <h1>Staberoha caricina</h1>
<p>Staberoha caricina, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a silvery sheen under sunlight. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
