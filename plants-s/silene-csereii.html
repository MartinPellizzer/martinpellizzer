<p>Silene csereii, commonly known as the Cserei's campion, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe.</p>

The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers with five petals, arranged in a raceme, during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid environment.</p>
<p>Silene csereii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
