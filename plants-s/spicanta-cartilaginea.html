                    <h1>Spicanta cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Spicanta cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilage spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its scientific name reflects the cartilage-like texture of its stems, which are thick and somewhat rubbery.</p>
<p>Spicanta cartilaginea is often found in rocky or dry habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
