                    <h1>Schiedeella chloraeiformis</h1>
<p>Schiedeella chloraeiformis, commonly known as the yellow sandplain lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that thrives in specific, often fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure and a distinct yellowish-green coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Schiedeella chloraeiformis is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
