<p>Setaria viridis var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese green millet, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
