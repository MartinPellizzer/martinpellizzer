                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos immucosus</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos immucosus, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence that resembles a ghostly, white flower cluster. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter, typical of epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
