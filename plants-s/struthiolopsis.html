                    <h1>Struthiolopsis</h1>
<p>Struthiolopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with a single leaf and a flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wet, swampy habitats. The plant is notable for its lack of a visible stem and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Struthiolopsis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
