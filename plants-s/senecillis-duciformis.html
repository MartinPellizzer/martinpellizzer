<p>Senecillis duciformis, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Senecillis duciformis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands.</p>
