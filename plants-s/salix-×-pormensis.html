                    <h1>Salix × pormensis</h1>
<p>Salix × pormensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (black willow), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for wind pollination.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to wet soils.</p>
