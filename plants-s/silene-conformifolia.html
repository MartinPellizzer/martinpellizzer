<p>Silene conformifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a flat, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene conformifolia thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores.</p>
