                    <h1>Sorghum matarankense</h1>
<p>Sorghum matarankense, commonly known as the Mataranka sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in panicles. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Sorghum matarankense is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of the local flora in the Mataranka region.</p>
