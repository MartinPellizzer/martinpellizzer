                            <h1>Sisymbrium Pumilum</h1>
<p>Field mustard, scientifically known as Sisymbrium pumilum, is a common flowering plant found in various habitats across North America. This annual plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along fences, thriving in temperate climates. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is often mistaken for other members of the Brassicaceae family due to its similar appearance. Despite its modest size, Field mustard plays an important role in ecological systems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to soil health.</p>
