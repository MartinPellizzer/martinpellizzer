<p>Sarracenia purpurea monstr.</p>
<p>heterophylla, commonly known as the giant purple pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. This variant is characterized by its unusually large, deep red to purple pitchers that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are modified into tubular traps lined with a slippery wax coating that prevents prey from escaping. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light to flourish.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
