<p>Stylidium ciliatum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spurred orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow leaf and produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Stylidium genus, which are known for their unique floral structures and specialized pollination mechanisms.</p>
