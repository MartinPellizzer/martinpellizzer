<p>Selaginella plumosa var. pallida, commonly known as the pale feather moss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on forest floors or in rocky crevices. It is native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and Japan, where it prefers cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
