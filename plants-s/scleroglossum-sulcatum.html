                    <h1>Scleroglossum sulcatum</h1>
<p>Scleroglossum sulcatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that are often covered in tiny, raised bumps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scleroglossum sulcatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
