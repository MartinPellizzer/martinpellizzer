<p>Sparganium lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf burr rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and produces spike-like clusters of small, spadix-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in spiky, burr-like structures that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
