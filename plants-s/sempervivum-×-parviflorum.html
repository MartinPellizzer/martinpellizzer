                    <h1>Sempervivum × parviflorum</h1>
<p>Sempervivum × parviflorum, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it easy to grow and spread in gardens and rockeries.</p>
