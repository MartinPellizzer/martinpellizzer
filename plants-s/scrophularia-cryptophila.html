                    <h1>Scrophularia cryptophila</h1>
<p>Scrophularia cryptophila, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Scrophularia cryptophila is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
