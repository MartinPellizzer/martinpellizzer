                    <h1>Seriphidium arbuscula</h1>
<p>Seriphidium arbuscula, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Seriphidium arbuscula is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
