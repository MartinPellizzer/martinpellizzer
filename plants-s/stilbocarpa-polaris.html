                <h1>Stilbocarpa polaris</h1>
<p>Stilbocarpa polaris, commonly known as the polar willow, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in harsh, cold environments with limited soil nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Stilbocarpa polaris is adapted to permafrost conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
