                    <h1>Strangalis</h1>
<p>Strangalis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the dappled light of the forest understory. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Strangalis produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and highly sought-after species in botanical studies.</p>
