<p>Selaginella uliginosa, commonly known as the bog spikerush, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Selaginella uliginosa is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of waterlogging.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
