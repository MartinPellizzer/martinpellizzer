<p>Sophora juanhintoniana, commonly known as the Juan Hinton's Sophora, is a rare and endangered leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered critically important for conservation efforts.</p>
