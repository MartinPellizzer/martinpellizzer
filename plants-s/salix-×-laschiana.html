<p>Salix × laschiana, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Salix alba and Salix viminalis.</p>
<p>It is noted for its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds.</p>
