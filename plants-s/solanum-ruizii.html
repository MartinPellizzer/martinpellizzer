                    <h1>Solanum ruizii</h1>
<p>Solanum ruizii, commonly known as the Ruiz's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in cloud forests and humid montane areas. The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or purple in color, followed by berries that range from yellow to red when mature. Solanum ruizii is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Solanaceae family.</p>
