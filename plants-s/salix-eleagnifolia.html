                    <h1>Salix eleagnifolia</h1>
<p>Salix eleagnifolia, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grayish branches and heart-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Silver willow is often found in moist soils near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to that found in willow bark.</p>
