                    <h1>Salix gracilistyla var. pendula</h1>
<p>Salix gracilistyla var. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a variant of the slender willow species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that exfoliates over time.</p>
