The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, often with five petals and prominent stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitude.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
