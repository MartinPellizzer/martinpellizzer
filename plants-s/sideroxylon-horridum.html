<p>Sideroxylon horridum, commonly known as the rough ironwood tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The tree is characterized by its thick, ridged bark and dark green, leathery leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The wood of Sideroxylon horridum is extremely hard and dense, making it highly valued for construction and furniture-making.</p>
