                    <h1>Selaginella lankawiensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella lankawiensis, commonly known as the Lankawi spikemoss, is a rare and endemic vascular plant found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth where humidity is high. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for protective measures to preserve its ecological niche.</p>
