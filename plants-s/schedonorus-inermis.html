<p>Schedonorus inermis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>Schedonorus inermis is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
