                    <h1>Senecio furfuraceus</h1>
<p>Senecio furfuraceus, commonly known as the Woolly Senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
