                    <h1>Stipa humilis f. minor</h1>
<p>Stipa humilis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf basketgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features slender, tufted stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are often pale green to reddish in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
