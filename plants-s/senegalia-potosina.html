<p>Senegalia potosina, commonly known as the Mexican screwbean, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senegalia potosina is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
