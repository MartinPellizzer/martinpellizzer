                    <h1>Syntherisma aequiglumis</h1>
<p>Syntherisma aequiglumis, commonly known as the flat-leaf syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
