<p>Sedum forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Sedum forsteri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
