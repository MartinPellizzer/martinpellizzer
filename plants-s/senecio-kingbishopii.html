<p>Senecio kingbishopii, commonly known as the Bishop's Cap, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
