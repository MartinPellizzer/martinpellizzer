<p>Strychnos robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's strychnos, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, mucilaginous coating. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
