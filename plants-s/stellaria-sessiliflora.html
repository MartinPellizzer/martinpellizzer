                    <h1>Stellaria sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Stellaria sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks, and are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and harsh growing conditions.</p>
