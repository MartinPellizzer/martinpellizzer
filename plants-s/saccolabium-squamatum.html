                    <h1>Saccolabium squamatum</h1>
<p>Saccolabium squamatum, commonly known as the scaly labium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing additional protection from intense sunlight and water loss.</p>
<p>Saccolabium squamatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
