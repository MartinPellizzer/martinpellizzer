                            <h1>Strychnos Innocua Subsp. Dysophylla</h1>
<p>Strychnos innocua subsp. dysophylla is a lesser-known member of the loganiaceae family native to parts of africa. it is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that give it a delicate appearance. despite its modest look, this plant holds cultural and medicinal significance in certain indigenous communities. its seeds, though toxic, have been used in traditional practices with caution. further study is needed to fully understand its ecological role and potential applications.</p>
