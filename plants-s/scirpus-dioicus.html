<p>Scirpus dioicus, commonly known as the greater bulrush, is a tall, reed-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has hollow, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are either male or female, making it dioecious. Its root system helps stabilize soil and filter water, contributing to wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus dioicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
