<p>Swartzia conferta var. conferta, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Leguminosae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its timber, though it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
