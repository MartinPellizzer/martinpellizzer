<p>Sarcochilus ceciliae, commonly known as Cecilia's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green to white flowers that have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows on the forest floor, often in shaded, humid environments, and has a distinctive, narrow pseudobulb. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus ceciliae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
