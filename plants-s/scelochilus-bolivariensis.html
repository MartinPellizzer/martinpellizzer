<p>Scelochilus bolivariensis, commonly known as the Bolivian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean highlands of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with small, intricate flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of ecological health in alpine ecosystems.</p>
