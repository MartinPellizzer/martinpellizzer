                <h1>Stigmatopteris heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Stigmatopteris heterocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
