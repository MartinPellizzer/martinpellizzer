<p>Sporobolus humilis subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as dwarf spora grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage that are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its narrow leaves and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
