<p>Sasa setigera, commonly known as the bamboo fern or Japanese bamboo, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems that grow in dense clumps. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base of the plant.

<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming thickets that can dominate certain habitats.</p>
