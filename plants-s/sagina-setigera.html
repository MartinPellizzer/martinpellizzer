<p>Sagina setigera, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its stems are often prostrate or slightly ascending, with a branching pattern that allows it to spread efficiently.</p>
<p>Sagina setigera is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
