                    <h1>Senegalia retusa</h1>
<p>Senegalia retusa, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Senegalia retusa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife.</p>
