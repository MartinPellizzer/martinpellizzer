                    <h1>Suaeda pruinosa var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Suaeda pruinosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with high salt content.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in coastal and desert habitats.</p>
