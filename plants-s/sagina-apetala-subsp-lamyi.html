<p>Sagina apetala subsp.</p>
<p>lamyi, commonly known as the mossy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
