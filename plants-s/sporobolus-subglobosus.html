<p>Sporobolus subglobosus, commonly known as the globular spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture. Its flowering stalks produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>Sporobolus subglobosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment.</p>
