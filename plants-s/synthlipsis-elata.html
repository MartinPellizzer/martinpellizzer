<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue and purple, which bloom in late summer. Its unique structure allows it to capture sunlight efficiently in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Synthlipsis elata is adapted to cold temperatures and low atmospheric pressure, making it a resilient and visually distinctive species.</p>
