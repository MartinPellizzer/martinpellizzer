                    <h1>Stachyphrynium calcicola</h1>
<p>Stachyphrynium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a rare and specialized plant native to the limestone regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, which are common in its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing due to habitat loss and limited population size.</p>
