                    <h1>Stenochlaena palustris</h1>
<p>Stenochlaena palustris, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
<p>Stenochlaena palustris plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
