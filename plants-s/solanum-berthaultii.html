                    <h1>Solanum berthaultii</h1>
<p>Solanum berthaultii, commonly known as the Berthault's nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum berthaultii produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
