<p>Scirpus fluitans, commonly known as floating bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that grow directly from the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes form dense underwater networks, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Scirpus fluitans thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
