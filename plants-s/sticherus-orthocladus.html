<p>Sticherus orthocladus, commonly known as the upright sticherus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy shoot system, and its leaves are usually arranged in a dense, overlapping manner. Sticherus orthocladus is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for propagation.</p>
