<p>Sagina hochstetteri, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with wiry, hairy stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to its native habitat, though it is sometimes considered invasive in other regions.</p>
