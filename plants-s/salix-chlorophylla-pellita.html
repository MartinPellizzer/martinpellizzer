                    <h1>Salix chlorophylla pellita</h1>
<p>Salix chlorophylla pellita, commonly known as the pale chlorophyll willow, is a rare and unique species within the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced chlorophyll content, which gives it a pale green or almost white appearance compared to typical willows. The plant exhibits specialized adaptations, including modified leaves that minimize photosynthetic activity. It thrives in specific, often nutrient-poor environments, such as wetlands or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique physiological traits, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
