<p>Solidago odora var. inodora, commonly known as the sweet goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod genus native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>While the name "sweet goldenrod" suggests a fragrance, this variety is actually noted for its lack of strong scent, distinguishing it from other goldenrod species.</p>
