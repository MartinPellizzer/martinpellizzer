<p>Salix × ungavensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix caprea and Salix phylicifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture and are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Salix × ungavensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
