<p>Salix pseudolivida f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
