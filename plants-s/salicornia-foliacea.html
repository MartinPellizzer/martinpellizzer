                    <h1>Salicornia foliacea</h1>
<p>Salicornia foliacea, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling survival in arid coastal areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by edible, salt-tolerant seeds. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Salicornia foliacea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes cultivated for its nutritional value.</p>
