<p>Scirpus nitidulus, commonly known as the smooth bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Scirpus nitidulus is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
