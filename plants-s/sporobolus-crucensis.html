                    <h1>Sporobolus crucensis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus crucensis, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are bristled with stiff, backward-pointing hairs. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it highly adapted to sandy and rocky soils. Its small, narrow leaves are typically covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus crucensis is often found in disturbed areas and can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
