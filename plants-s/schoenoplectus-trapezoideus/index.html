<p>Trapezoid bulrush, scientifically known as Schoenoplectus trapezoideus, is a hardy wetland plant native to North America. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. With its distinctive triangular stems and tall, narrow leaves, it plays a vital role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its resilience and ecological importance make it a key component of wetland habitats.</p>
