<p>Sarcocadetia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The leaves are usually alternate, lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. Sarcocadetia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
