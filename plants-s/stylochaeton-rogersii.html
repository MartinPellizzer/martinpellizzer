<p>Stylochaeton rogersii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Stylochaeton rogersii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
