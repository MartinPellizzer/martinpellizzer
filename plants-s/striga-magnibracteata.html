                    <h1>Striga magnibracteata</h1>
<p>Striga magnibracteata, commonly known as the giant witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often white or purple in color. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and attaching to the roots of host plants, such as millet and sorghum.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant agricultural damage, making it a major weed in food crops.</p>
