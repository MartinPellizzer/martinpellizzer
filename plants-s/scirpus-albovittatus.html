<p>Scirpus albovittatus, commonly known as the white-striped bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a distinctive white or pale stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil conditions. Scirpus albovittatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
