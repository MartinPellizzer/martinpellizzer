                    <h1>Seddera humilis</h1>
<p>Seddera humilis, commonly known as the dwarf seddera, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale blue or white, which appear in late spring to early summer. Seddera humilis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
