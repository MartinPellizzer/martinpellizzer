                    <h1>Spartina bahiensis</h1>
<p>Spartina bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Spartina bahiensis is also adapted to withstand periodic flooding and saltwater exposure, making it an important component of estuarine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to habitat complexity for various wildlife species.</p>
