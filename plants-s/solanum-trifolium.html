<p>Solanum trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are often trifoliate, meaning they have three leaflets. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Solanum trifolium is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
