<p>Saxifraga flagellaris subsp.</p>
<p>crassiflagellata, commonly known as the broad-flagellate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
