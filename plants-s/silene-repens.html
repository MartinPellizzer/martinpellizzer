<p>Silene repens, commonly known as the creeping catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Silene repens is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
