<p>Saxifraga parvula, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense clusters of small, bright green leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Saxifraga parvula is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
