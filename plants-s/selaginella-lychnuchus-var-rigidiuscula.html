                    <h1>Selaginella lychnuchus var. rigidiuscula</h1>
<p>Selaginella lychnuchus var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to survive in low-light conditions.</p>
