                    <h1>Spirillus</h1>
<p>Spirillus, commonly known as the spiral-shaped bacterium, is a genus of bacteria characterized by their unique helical or spiral morphology.</p>
<p>These microorganisms are typically found in aquatic environments, soil, and sometimes in association with plants. Spirillus species are often motile, utilizing flagella for movement through their surroundings. They play a role in nutrient cycling and can contribute to the decomposition of organic matter.</p>
<p>However, some species may be pathogenic, causing infections in both plants and animals.</p>
