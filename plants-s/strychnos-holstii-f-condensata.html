<p>Strychnos holstii f. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf strychnos, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, elongated fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with other members of its genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to the presence of toxic alkaloids.</p>
