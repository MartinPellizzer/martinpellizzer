<p>Salvia oreades, commonly known as mountain sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Salvia oreades is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
