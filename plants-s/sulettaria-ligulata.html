<p>Sulettaria ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations.</p>
<p>Sulettaria ligulata is an important indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity.</p>
