                    <h1>Sinorchis</h1>
<p>Sinorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, flower-like structures that resemble petals rather than true leaves. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often submerged in water. It thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is closely associated with specific types of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sinorchis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
