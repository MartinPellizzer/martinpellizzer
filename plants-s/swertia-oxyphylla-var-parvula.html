                    <h1>Swertia oxyphylla var. parvula</h1>
<p>Swertia oxyphylla var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf swertia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
