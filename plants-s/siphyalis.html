<p>Siphyalis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, ray flowers and bract-like leaves that resemble sea urchins. They are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. Siphyalis species are perennial herbs that produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of maritime ecosystems.</p>
