<p>Stipa pulcherrima var. gallica, commonly known as the Galician feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, silky silver-green foliage that gives it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes in late summer, adding a subtle floral touch to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent choice for xeriscaping and sustainable landscaping.</p>
