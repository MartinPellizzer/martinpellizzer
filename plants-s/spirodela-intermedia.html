                    <h1>Spirodela intermedia</h1>
<p>Spirodela intermedia, commonly known as floating shieldweed, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has a rosette-like structure with broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It spreads primarily through vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats that can cover large areas of still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
