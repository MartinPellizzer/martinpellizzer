                    <h1>Salicornia herbacea var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Salicornia herbacea var. procumbens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, jointed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by tiny, bead-like seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
