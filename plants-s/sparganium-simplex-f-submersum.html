<p>Sparganium simplex f. submersum, commonly known as the submerged bur-reed, is a variant of the common bur-reed that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged stems and reduced leaves, which are adapted for life in water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's surface. Its reproductive structures are specialized for water dispersal, aiding in its spread across wetlands.</p>
<p>This form is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
