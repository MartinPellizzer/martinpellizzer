<p>[WRONG START] Steles aenigma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears striking white or pale pink flowers resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded forest canopies where it attaches itself to tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, Stelis aenigma is considered a conservation concern.</p>
