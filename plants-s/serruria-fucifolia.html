<p>Serruria fucifolia, commonly known as the coastal serruria, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fucoid (seaweed-like) leaves, which are adapted to tolerate saline and humid conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it thrives in the unique microclimate provided by the sea breeze. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Serruria fucifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
