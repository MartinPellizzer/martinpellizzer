<p>Sorbus medogensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by persistent, orange-red berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Sorbus medogensis is adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments and exhibits a high degree of drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
