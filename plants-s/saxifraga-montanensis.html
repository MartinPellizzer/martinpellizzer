<p>Saxifraga montanensis, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga montanensis is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
