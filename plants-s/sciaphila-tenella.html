                    <h1>Sciaphila tenella</h1>
<p>Sciaphila tenella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble leaves rather than true foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
