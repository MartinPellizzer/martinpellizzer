                    <h1>Schoenus punctorius</h1>
<p>Schoenus punctorius, commonly known as the punctured sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Schoenus punctorius is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
