<p>Senegalia albanensis, commonly known as the Albanian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that attract various pollinators, including bees and birds. Its seed pods are woody and contain a large number of small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Senegalia albanensis is well adapted to harsh environments, making it an important species for soil stabilization and desert ecosystems.</p>
