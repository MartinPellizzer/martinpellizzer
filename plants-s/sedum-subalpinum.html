The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Sedum subalpinum is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
