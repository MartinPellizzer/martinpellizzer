                    <h1>Selaginella fissidentoides f. ovata</h1>
<p>Selaginella fissidentoides f. ovata, commonly known as the ovate clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
