<p>Succisa columbaria, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Succisa columbaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in extreme conditions.</p>
