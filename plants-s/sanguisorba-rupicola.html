<p>Sanguisorba rupicola, commonly known as rock sanguisorbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Sanguisorba rupicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
