<p>Stelis ramiro-medinae, commonly known as the Medina's stelis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid environments with high light exposure and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
