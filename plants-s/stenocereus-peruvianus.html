                    <h1>Stenocereus peruvianus</h1>
<p>Stenocereus peruvianus, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to South America, particularly Peru and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a tall, spiny stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its fruit, a red, fleshy berry, is edible and contains seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important part of its ecosystem.</p>
