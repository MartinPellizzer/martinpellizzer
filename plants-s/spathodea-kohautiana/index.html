                            <h1>Spathodea Kohautiana</h1>
<p>Kohaut's flame tree, scientifically known as Spathodea kohautiana, is a striking tropical species native to western Africa. With its vibrant orange-red flowers and broad, palm-like leaves, it stands out as a botanical marvel in its native habitat. This tree is celebrated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm climates for its dramatic visual impact. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to more commonly known species like the flame tree (Spathodea campanulata). Its unique characteristics make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanical researchers.</p>
