                    <h1>Salix repens var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Salix repens var. rotundifolia, commonly known as creeping willow with round leaves, is a low-growing shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender,匍匐 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are oval to round in shape, with a smooth margin, and are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It produces catkins in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators.</p>
