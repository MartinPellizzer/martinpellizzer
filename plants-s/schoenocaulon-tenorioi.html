                    <h1>Schoenocaulon tenorioi</h1>
<p>Schoenocaulon tenorioi, commonly known as the Tenorio's mountain heath, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
