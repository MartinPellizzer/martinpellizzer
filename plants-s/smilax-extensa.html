                    <h1>Smilax extensa</h1>
<p>Smilax extensa, commonly known as the long-stemmed catbrier, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with spiny nodes and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Smilax extensa is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be considered invasive in certain regions.</p>
