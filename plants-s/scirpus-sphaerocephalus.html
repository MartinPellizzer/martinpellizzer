                    <h1>Scirpus sphaerocephalus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and dense, rounded clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The globe sedge is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
