<p>Stylidium trudgenii, commonly known as the Trudgen's triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Haemodoraceae, which includes plants known for their striking, often red or orange flowers. The plant is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that open sequentially, giving the appearance of being triggered by touch. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Stylidium trudgenii is also notable for its ability to produce a sticky substance from its glandular hairs, which may play a role in its ecological interactions.</p>
