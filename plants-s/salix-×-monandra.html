<p>Salix × monandra, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix matsudana (Chinese willow). The plant is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Salix × monandra is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and early spring foliage.</p>
