                    <h1>Senecio poculiferus</h1>
<p>Senecio poculiferus, commonly known as the "cup-bearing senecio," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Senecio poculiferus is well-suited for rock gardens or dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
