<p>Silene adenopetala, commonly known as the woolly catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Silene adenopetala is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
