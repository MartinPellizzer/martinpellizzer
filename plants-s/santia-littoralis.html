                <h1>Santia littoralis</h1>
<p>Santia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal santia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Santia littoralis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to coastal habitats.</p>
