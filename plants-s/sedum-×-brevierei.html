                    <h1>Sedum × brevierei</h1>
<p>Sedum × brevierei, commonly known as the stonecrop hybrid, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in late summer. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Sedum acre and Sedum hispanicum.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
