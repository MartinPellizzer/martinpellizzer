<p>Saxifraga chamissonis, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga chamissonis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
