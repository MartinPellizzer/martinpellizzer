                    <h1>Stylosanthes tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Stylosanthes tenuifolia, commonly known as slender stylosanthes, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species for livestock in dry climates. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through root nodules enhances soil fertility, contributing to its ecological and agricultural significance.</p>
<p>Stylosanthes tenuifolia is also used in erosion control and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and dense foliage.</p>
