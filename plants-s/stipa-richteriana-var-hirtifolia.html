                    <h1>Stipa richteriana var. hirtifolia</h1>
<p>Stipa richteriana var. hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-nutrient soils and drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
