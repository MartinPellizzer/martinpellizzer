<p>Sporobolus disjunctus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its spread across arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Sporobolus disjunctus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
