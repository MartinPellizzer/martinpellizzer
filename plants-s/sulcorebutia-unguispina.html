<p>Sulcorebutia unguispina, commonly known as the "spiny sun rose," is a succulent plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Sulcorebutia unguispina is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
