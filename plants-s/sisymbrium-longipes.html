<p>Sisymbrium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Sisymbrium longipes is known for its unique ecological interactions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
