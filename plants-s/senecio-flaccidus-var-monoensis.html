                    <h1>Senecio flaccidus var. monoensis</h1>
<p>Senecio flaccidus var. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often found near the shores of Mono Lake. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
