<p>Sasa pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Sasa pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>
