<p>Stoechadomentha capitata, commonly known as the water clover, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating leaves that form a mat on the water surface, aiding in water filtration and habitat creation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are highly branched and help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Stoechadomentha capitata plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of freshwater habitats.</p>
