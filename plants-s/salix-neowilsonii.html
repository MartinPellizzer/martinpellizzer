<p>Salix neowilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
