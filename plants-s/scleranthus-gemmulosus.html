                    <h1>Scleranthus gemmulosus</h1>
<p>Scleranthus gemmulosus, commonly known as the gemmulate sandspur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, spiny fruits that contain seeds with a unique gemmiferous structure, allowing for vegetative propagation. The plant typically has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some areas but also plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
