                    <h1>Schimmelia</h1>
<p>Schimmelia, commonly known as the "cushion plant," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, mat-forming species that thrive in rocky or alpine environments. Schimmelia species are characterized by their compact growth habit, with dense clusters of leaves that form a cushion-like structure. They produce small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized habitat requirements, many Schimmelia species are rare and are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
