                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos arbuscula</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos arbuscula, commonly known as the small ball cactus, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with a dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti.</p>
<p>Sphaerostephanos arbuscula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem for survival.</p>
