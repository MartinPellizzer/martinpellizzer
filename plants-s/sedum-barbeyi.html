<p>Sedum barbeyi, commonly known as the Barbey's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Sedum barbeyi is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
