                    <h1>Solanum fugax</h1>
<p>Solanum fugax, commonly known as the transient nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its rapid life cycle and short-lived blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a tendency to disappear quickly after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its ephemeral nature, it is often overlooked in ecological studies despite its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
