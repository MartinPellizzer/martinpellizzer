<p>Serpicula brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and closely packed, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Serpicula brevipes is often found in temperate regions and is a common component of moss and liverwort communities.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as peristomes, are well-developed and aid in spore dispersal.</p>
