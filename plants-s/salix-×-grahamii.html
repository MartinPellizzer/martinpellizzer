                    <h1>Salix × grahamii</h1>
<p>Salix × grahamii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
