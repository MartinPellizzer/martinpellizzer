                    <h1>Selaginella caudata var. guichenotii</h1>
<p>Selaginella caudata var. guichenotii, commonly known as the Guichenot's spike moss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, thread-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters around its strobila, which contains the spore-producing structures. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of its order, Selaginellales.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
