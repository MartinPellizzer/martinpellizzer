<p>Stelis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand and Malaysia. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor. Its slender stems are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help protect it from excessive moisture loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and pale greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance, making it a unique addition to tropical botanical gardens.</p>
