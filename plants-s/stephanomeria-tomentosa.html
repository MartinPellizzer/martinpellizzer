<p>Stephanomeria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>
<p>Stephanomeria tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
