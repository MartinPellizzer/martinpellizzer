<p>Serianthes hooglandii, commonly known as the highland ironwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and slow growth rate, which makes it highly valuable for timber. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
