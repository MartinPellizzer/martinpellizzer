                    <h1>Spinoliva</h1>
<p>Spinoliva, commonly known as the "moonflower of the desert," is a rare and striking plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers typically open only after sunset and close by dawn, adapting to the limited daylight of its habitat.</p>
<p>Spinoliva is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
