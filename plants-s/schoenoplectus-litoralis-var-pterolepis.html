                    <h1>Schoenoplectus litoralis var. pterolepis</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus litoralis var. pterolepis, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments along coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense stands, forming part of the vegetation in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowering spikes are usually borne at the top of the plant, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variant is well-suited to saline and brackish water conditions, contributing to the ecological stability of coastal wetlands.</p>
