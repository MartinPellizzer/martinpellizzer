<p>Saxifraga × gusmusii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga cespitosa, which gives it unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
