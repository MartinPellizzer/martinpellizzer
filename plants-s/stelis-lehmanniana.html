                    <h1>Stelis lehmanniana</h1>
<p>Stelis lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a contrasting lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Stelis lehmanniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm, humid environments.</p>
