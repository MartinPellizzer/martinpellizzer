                    <h1>Stipa turgaica</h1>
<p>Stipa turgaica, commonly known as the Tugai needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Stipa turgaica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
