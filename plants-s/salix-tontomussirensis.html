                    <h1>Salix tontomussirensis</h1>
<p>Salix tontomussirensis, commonly known as the Tontomussire willow, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its root system is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, making it resilient to harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
