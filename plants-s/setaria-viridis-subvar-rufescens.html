<p>Setaria viridis subvar. rufescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish tinge, especially at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
