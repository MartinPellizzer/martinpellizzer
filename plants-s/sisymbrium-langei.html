                    <h1>Sisymbrium langei</h1>
<p>Sisymbrium langei, commonly known as the Lange's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
