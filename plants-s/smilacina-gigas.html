<p>Smilacina gigas, commonly known as the giant greenbriar, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Smilacaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilacina gigas thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a notable wild plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
