                    <h1>Sparganium fluitans</h1>
<p>Sparganium fluitans, commonly known as floating clubmoss, is a water-dwelling plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its erect, spore-bearing stems that rise above the water surface. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Sparganium fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
