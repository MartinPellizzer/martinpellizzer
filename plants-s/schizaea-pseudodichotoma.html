<p>Schizaea pseudodichotoma, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are often divided into two parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Schizaea pseudodichotoma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
