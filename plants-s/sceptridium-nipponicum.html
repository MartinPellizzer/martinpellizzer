<p>Sceptridium nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese fern, is a delicate and rare species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its leaves rather than flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
