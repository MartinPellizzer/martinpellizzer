                    <h1>Stipagrostis</h1>
<p>Stipagrostis, commonly known as needlegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Stipagrostis species are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They often form dense vegetation cover, which helps prevent soil erosion in their native habitats.</p>
<p>Many species are used for forage or in restoration projects due to their hardy nature.</p>
