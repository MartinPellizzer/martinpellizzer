<p>Soliva microloma, commonly known as small-leaved soliva, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Soliva microloma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
