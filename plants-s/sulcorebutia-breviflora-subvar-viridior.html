                    <h1>Sulcorebutia breviflora subvar. viridior</h1>
<p>Sulcorebutia breviflora subvar. viridior, commonly known as the green-flowered stonecress, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy stems that often form a rosette shape, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Its leaves are usually thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
