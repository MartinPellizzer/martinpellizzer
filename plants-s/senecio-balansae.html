<p>Senecio balansae, commonly known as the Balansae groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has narrow, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio balansae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
