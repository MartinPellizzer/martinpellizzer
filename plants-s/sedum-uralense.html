                    <h1>Sedum uralense</h1>
<p>Sedum uralense, commonly known as the Ural stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Sedum uralense is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
