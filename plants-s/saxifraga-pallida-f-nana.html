<p>Saxifraga pallida f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf white saxifrage, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
