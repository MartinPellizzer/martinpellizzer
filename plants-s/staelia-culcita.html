                    <h1>Staelia culcita</h1>
<p>Staelia culcita, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, violet or purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, flowering stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments.</p>
<p>Staelia culcita is often found in association with other wetland flora, such as sedges and rushes, in nutrient-poor, acidic conditions.</p>
