<p>Salicornia perfoliata, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Salicornia perfoliata is commonly found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats.</p>
