<p>Sparganium rostratum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, three-lobed structure called a bur, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals.</p>
<p>Sparganium rostratum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
