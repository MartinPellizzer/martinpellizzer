                    <h1>Selaginella subarborescens</h1>
<p>Selaginella subarborescens, commonly known as the tree spikemoss, is a vascular fern that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a trait typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
