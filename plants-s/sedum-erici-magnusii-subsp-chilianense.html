<p>Sedum erici-magnusii subsp.</p>
<p>chilianense, commonly known as the Chilian sedum, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<p>It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
