                    <h1>Scleria glomerulata</h1>
<p>Scleria glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Scleria glomerulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
