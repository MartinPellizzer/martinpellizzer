                    <h1>Smilax collina</h1>
<p>Smilax collina, commonly known as creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Smilax collina thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth habit makes it both a valuable ecological component and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
