                    <h1>Senecio calamitosus</h1>
<p>Senecio calamitosus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
