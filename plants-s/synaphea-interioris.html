                    <h1>Synaphea interioris</h1>
<p>Synaphea interioris, commonly known as the interior ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the understory of humid tropical forests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly shadows, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the foliage, making it challenging to identify without close inspection.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Synaphea interioris is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying rare plant adaptations.</p>
