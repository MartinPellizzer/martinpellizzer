<p>Schomburgkia chionodora, commonly known as the white snow orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, Schomburgkia chionodora is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
