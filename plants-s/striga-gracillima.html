                    <h1>Striga gracillima</h1>
<p>Striga gracillima, commonly known as the slender witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its parasitic nature makes it a significant agricultural pest, particularly in cereal crops.</p>
<p>Striga gracillima is also notable for its ability to produce large numbers of seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in affected regions.</p>
