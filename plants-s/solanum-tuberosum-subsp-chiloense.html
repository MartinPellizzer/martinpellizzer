<p>chiloense, commonly known as the Chilean potato, is a botanical subspecies native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the common potato.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its growing conditions. Its tubers are often used in local cuisines and have been studied for their potential agricultural value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also of interest in plant breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
