<p>Smilax china var. igaensis, commonly known as the Chinese smilax, is a variant of the Smilax genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny projections, which help it to cling to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its berries are orange-red when ripe and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a distinct midrib.</p>
