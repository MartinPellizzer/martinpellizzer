                    <h1>Saxifraga moschata f. planifolia</h1>
<p>Saxifraga moschata f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved saxifrage, is a compact perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broadly ovate, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
