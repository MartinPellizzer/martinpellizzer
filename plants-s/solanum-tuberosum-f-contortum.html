                    <h1>Solanum tuberosum f. contortum</h1>
<p>Solanum tuberosum f. contortum, commonly known as the twisted potato, is a unique botanical variant of the common potato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, curling leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. This form is typically a wild relative of the cultivated potato and is found in various regions of South America. The plant produces small, edible tubers similar to the common potato, though they are less widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological traits and potential genetic contributions to potato breeding programs.</p>
