<p>Scoliosorus mannianus, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests where it clings to rocky surfaces or decaying wood. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Scoliosorus mannianus plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
