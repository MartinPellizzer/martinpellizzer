                    <h1>Selenocarpaea</h1>
<p>Selenocarpaea, commonly known as the moonflower of the desert, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions through its deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its scent and bioluminescent properties.</p>
<p>Selenocarpaea is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments due to its unique survival strategies.</p>
