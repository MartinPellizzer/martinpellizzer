                    <h1>Santaloides splendida</h1>
<p>Santaloides splendida, commonly known as the splendid sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalales order.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces fragrant, white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat requirements, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics.</p>
