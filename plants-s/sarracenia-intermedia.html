<p>Sarracenia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate whorled sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and whorled arrangement of leaves that form a rosette. The plant's modified leaves, called pitchers, are specialized for trapping and digesting insects. These pitchers are typically red or reddish in color, with a glossy surface that attracts prey.</p>
<p>Sarracenia intermedia thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
