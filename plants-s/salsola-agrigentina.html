                    <h1>Salsola agrigentina</h1>
<p>Salsola agrigentina, commonly known as Armenian saltwort, is a halophytic plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Salsola agrigentina is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils.</p>
