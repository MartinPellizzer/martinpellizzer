<p>Selaginella ovifolia subsp.</p>
<p>philipsonii, commonly known as the Philippine clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters, giving it a moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which are typically found at the tips of its leaf clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
