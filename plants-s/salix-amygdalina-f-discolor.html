                    <h1>Salix amygdalina f. discolor</h1>
<p>Salix amygdalina f. discolor, commonly known as the white-barked weeping willow, is a unique variant of the weeping willow species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white or pale bark that contrasts with its cascading branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires careful management due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
