<p>Stipa flexibarbata, commonly known as the flexible beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
