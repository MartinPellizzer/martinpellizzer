                    <h1>Sporobolus virginicus var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Sporobolus virginicus var. littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
