                    <h1>Scirpus angolensis var. briziformis</h1>
<p>Scirpus angolensis var. briziformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically grouped in spikelets, which are borne on elongated stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along lake shores.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
