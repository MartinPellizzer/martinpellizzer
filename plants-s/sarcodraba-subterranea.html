The plant's leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry climate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or brownish in color, which helps it blend into its surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
