<p>Salix watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>
