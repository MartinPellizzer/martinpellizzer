<p>Stegnogramma mollissima var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated stegnogramma, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are usually broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
