                    <h1>Saxifraga clarionii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga clarionii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found in crevices and among gravelly soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga clarionii is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
