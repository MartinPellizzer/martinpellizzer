<p>Salix triandra subsp.</p>
<p>amygdalina, commonly known as the almond willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas.</p>
