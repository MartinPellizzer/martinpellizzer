<p>Sesamothamnus rivae, commonly known as the river sesamothamnus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, which bloom in spring. Sesamothamnus rivae is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss.</p>
