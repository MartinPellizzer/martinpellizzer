<p>Saxifraga aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>capitata, commonly known as water saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in northern Europe. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense mats that help stabilize sediments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting aquatic biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates.</p>
