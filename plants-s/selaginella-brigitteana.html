                    <h1>Selaginella brigitteana</h1>
<p>Selaginella brigitteana, commonly known as the Bristly Clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged along its creeping stems. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it reproduces primarily through spores released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Selaginella brigitteana is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant adaptations.</p>
