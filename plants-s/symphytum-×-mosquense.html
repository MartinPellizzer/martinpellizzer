                    <h1>Symphytum × mosquense</h1>
<p>Symphytum × mosquense, commonly known as Russian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its deep taproot, which allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It contains high levels of allantoin, making it useful in traditional medicine for healing wounds and skin conditions.</p>
<p>However, due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
