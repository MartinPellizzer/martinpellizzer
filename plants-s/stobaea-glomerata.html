                    <h1>Stobaea glomerata</h1>
<p>Stobaea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the lichen family, which is a symbiotic union of fungi and algae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth form, with small, rounded lobes that form a compact structure. This species typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in temperate and subarctic regions. Its botanical structure is simple, with no distinct roots, stems, or leaves, relying instead on the photosynthetic partner for energy.</p>
<p>Stobaea glomerata plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
