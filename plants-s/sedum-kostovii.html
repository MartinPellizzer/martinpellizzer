<p>Sedum kostovii, commonly known as the Kostov's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It grows low to the ground, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Sedum kostovii is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
