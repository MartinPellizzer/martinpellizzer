                    <h1>Sauvagesia ericoides</h1>
<p>Sauvagesia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens in regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>
