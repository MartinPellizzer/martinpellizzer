                <h1>Strepsia usneoides</h1>
<p>Strepsia usneoides, commonly known as the beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on bark and tree trunks in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a flat, leaf-like structure with a greenish-gray upper surface and a white, woolly underside. The lichen consists of a fungal component and algal partners that provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found in humid environments and is an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
