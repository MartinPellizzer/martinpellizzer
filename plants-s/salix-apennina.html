                    <h1>Salix apennina</h1>
<p>Salix apennina, commonly known as the Italian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Salix apennina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
