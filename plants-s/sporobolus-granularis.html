<p>Sporobolus granularis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus granularis is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
