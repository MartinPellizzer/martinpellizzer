<p>Schnella sprucei, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with dense, dark green foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are short and stiff, arranged in whorls around the stems. Its cones are small and usually shed their seeds naturally, contributing to its limited spread.</p>
<p>Schnella sprucei is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
