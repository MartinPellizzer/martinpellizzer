<p>Scopolia lurida, commonly known as the pale scopolia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often tinged with purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Scopolia lurida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
