                    <h1>Sclerococcus</h1>
<p>Sclerococcus, commonly known as the "corky cushion lichen," is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that forms dense, cushion-shaped growths on tree bark and stone. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together carry out photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Sclerococcus is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on shaded, moist surfaces.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to ecosystem biodiversity.</p>
