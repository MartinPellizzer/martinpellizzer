                    <h1>Salix hypericifolia</h1>
<p>Salix hypericifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and riparian areas.</p>
<p>Salix hypericifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
