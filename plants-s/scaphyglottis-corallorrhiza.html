                    <h1>Scaphyglottis corallorrhiza</h1>
<p>Scaphyglottis corallorrhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a unique orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition.</p>
<p>It is a root parasite, meaning it derives its nutrients from the roots of other plants rather than through photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
