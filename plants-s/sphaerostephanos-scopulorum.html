<p>Sphaerostephanos scopulorum, commonly known as the rock starflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Sphaerostephanos scopulorum is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators.</p>
