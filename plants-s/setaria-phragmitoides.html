<p>Setaria phragmitoides, commonly known as the flatgrass or narrowleaf flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important pioneer species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
