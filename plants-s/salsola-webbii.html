                    <h1>Salsola webbii</h1>
<p>Salsola webbii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or sandy soils effectively.</p>
<p>Salsola webbii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
