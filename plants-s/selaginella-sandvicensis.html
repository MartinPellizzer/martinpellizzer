                    <h1>Selaginella sandvicensis</h1>
<p>Selaginella sandvicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian clubmoss, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and creeping growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and mesic forests. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
