                    <h1>Spiranthes eatonii</h1>
<p>Spiranthes eatonii, commonly known as Eaton's spiral orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of flowers along the stem, which gives it its common name. Native to the eastern United States, this orchid typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
