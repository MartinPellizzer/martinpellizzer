                            <h1>Senecio Rodolfoi</h1>
<p>Rodolfo's senecio, scientifically known as Senecio rodolfoi, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. This member of the Asteraceae family is characterized by its delicate, spire-like growth and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its beauty, it is highly endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection by horticultural enthusiasts. Found primarily in the Western Cape, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique species from extinction.</p>
