                    <h1>Scirpus palustris var. uniglumis</h1>
<p>Scirpus palustris var. uniglumis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in marshes and shallow waters.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water repellence.</p>
