<p>Sparganium ramosum subsp.</p>
<p>stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping bur-reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It typically forms dense, mat-like colonies in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spike-like clusters, which are followed by spiky, cone-like fruits. Its stolons allow for vegetative propagation and help it spread across moist habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing shoreline sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
