                    <h1>Salix tibetica var. juparica</h1>
<p>Salix tibetica var. juparica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
