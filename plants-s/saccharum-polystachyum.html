<p>Saccharum polystachyum, commonly known as the giant bamboo or giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stalks, which are followed by long, narrow seed pods. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its rapid growth and is used in traditional medicine, construction, and as a source of fiber.</p>
