                    <h1>Salsola rodinii</h1>
<p>Salsola rodinii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>Salsola rodinii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
