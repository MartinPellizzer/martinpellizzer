<p>Sclerothrix fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered crust lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly packed, pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, fibrous texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in temperate and tropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are dispersed through wind and water.</p>
<p>Sclerothrix fasciculata plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecological niche.</p>
