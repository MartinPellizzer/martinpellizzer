                    <h1>Solidago nemoralis var. arenicola</h1>
<p>Solidago nemoralis var. arenicola, commonly known as the sandy goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant produces showy, yellow inflorescences composed of numerous small disk flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other goldenrod species but is distinguished by its habitat preference and slightly different floral structure.</p>
