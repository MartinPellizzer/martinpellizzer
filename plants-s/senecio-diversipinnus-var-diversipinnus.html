                    <h1>Senecio diversipinnus var. diversipinnus</h1>
<p>Senecio diversipinnus var. diversipinnus, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in summer, arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
