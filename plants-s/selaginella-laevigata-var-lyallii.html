                    <h1>Selaginella laevigata var. lyallii</h1>
<p>Selaginella laevigata var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its morphological similarity to other Selaginella species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest.</p>
