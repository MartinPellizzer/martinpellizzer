<p>Statice avei, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>

The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Statice avei is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value.</p>
