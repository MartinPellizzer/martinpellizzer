                    <h1>Scurrula parasitica var. graciliflora</h1>
<p>Scurrula parasitica var. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered scurrula, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, elongated floral stems are characteristic of the variety.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it is often found in shaded, moist environments where suitable host plants are present.</p>
