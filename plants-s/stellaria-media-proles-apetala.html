                    <h1>Stellaria media proles apetala</h1>
<p>Stellaria media proles apetala, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and apetalous flowers.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a basal rosette structure. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that lack petals, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and runners, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
