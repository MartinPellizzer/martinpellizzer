                    <h1>Selaginella megaphylla</h1>
<p>Selaginella megaphylla, commonly known as the giant spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and a distinct, branching stem structure. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
