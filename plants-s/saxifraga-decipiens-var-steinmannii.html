<p>Saxifraga decipiens var. steinmannii, commonly known as the Steinmann's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
