<p>Spirostachys venenifera, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves contain irritant compounds, which can cause skin inflammation and are responsible for its common name.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
