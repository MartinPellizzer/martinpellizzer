<p>Salvia rhizomatosa, commonly known as creeping sage, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Salvia rhizomatosa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
