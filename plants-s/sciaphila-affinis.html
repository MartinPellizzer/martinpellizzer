<p>Sciaphila affinis, commonly known as the shade orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it has slender, grass-like leaves. Sciaphila affinis is characterized by its unique rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
