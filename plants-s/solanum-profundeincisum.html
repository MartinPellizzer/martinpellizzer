<p>Solanum profundeincisum, commonly known as the deep-cut nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with deeply incised lobes and clusters of small, violet-pink flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
