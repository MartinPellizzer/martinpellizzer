                    <h1>Scirpus supinus var. uninodis</h1>
<p>Scirpus supinus var. uninodis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its single node on the stem, which sets it apart from other Scirpus species.</p>
