                    <h1>Stapelia conspurcata</h1>
<p>Stapelia conspurcata, commonly known as the dirty stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, odorless flowers that resemble carrion, a trait common in many stapelia species to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Stapelia conspurcata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
