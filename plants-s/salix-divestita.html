                    <h1>Salix divestita</h1>
<p>Salix divestita, commonly known as the naked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are usually hairless or very sparsely hairy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix divestita is thin and smooth, often peeling in strips, giving it its common name.</p>
