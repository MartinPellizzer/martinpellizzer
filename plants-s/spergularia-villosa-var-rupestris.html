                    <h1>Spergularia villosa var. rupestris</h1>
<p>Spergularia villosa var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or rocky areas.</p>
