<p>Sphaerocoma hookeri subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the coastal sphaerocoma, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to coastal conditions, showing resilience to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
