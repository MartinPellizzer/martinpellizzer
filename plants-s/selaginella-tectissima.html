<p>Selaginella tectissima, commonly known as the "spikemoss," is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its primitive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and fire, due to its desiccation-tolerant spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, forming dense mats or low-growing structures. Its sporophyte stage is distinguished by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Selaginella tectissima plays a significant ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
