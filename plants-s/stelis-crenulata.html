<p>Stelis crenulata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a distinctive zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Stelis crenulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
