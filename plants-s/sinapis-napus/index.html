                            <h1>Sinapis Napus</h1>
<p>Sinapis napus, commonly known as oilseed rape, is a versatile and economically important plant widely cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. This member of the Brassicaceae family is native to Europe and has been domesticated for thousands of years. Its bright yellow flowers make it a striking addition to agricultural landscapes and a key pollinator attractant. The plant is also valued for its role in crop rotation and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing properties. Despite its benefits, Sinapis napus can become a weed in certain environments, posing challenges for farmers and land managers.</p>
