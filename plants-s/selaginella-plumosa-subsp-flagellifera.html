<p>Selaginella plumosa subsp.</p>
<p>flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate spikemoss, is a rare and delicate member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
