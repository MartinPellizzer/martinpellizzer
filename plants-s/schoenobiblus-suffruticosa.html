                    <h1>Schoenobiblus suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Schoenobiblus suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with a deep root system and small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
