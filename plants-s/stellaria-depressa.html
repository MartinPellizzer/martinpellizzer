                    <h1>Stellaria depressa</h1>
<p>Stellaria depressa, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender stems that often lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Stellaria depressa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
