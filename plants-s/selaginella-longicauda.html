                    <h1>Selaginella longicauda</h1>
<p>Selaginella longicauda, commonly known as the scaly hound's-tongue, is a species of spiky, evergreen plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, long, trailing stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It is well adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a specialized ability to enter a dormant state called poikiloblasty.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to withstand extreme drought and regenerate after rain.</p>
