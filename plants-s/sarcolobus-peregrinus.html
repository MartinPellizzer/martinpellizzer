                    <h1>Sarcolobus peregrinus</h1>
<p>Sarcolobus peregrinus, commonly known as the wandering leaf plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that often exhibit a striking variegation of green and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are followed by clustered, fleshy fruits. Sarcolobus peregrinus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to moist conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
