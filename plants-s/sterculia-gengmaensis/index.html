                            <h1>Sterculia Gengmaensis</h1>
<p>Gengma sterculia, scientifically known as Sterculia gengmaensis, is a rare and fascinating plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. This unique tree belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy flowers. Despite its ecological significance, it remains little known outside of botanical circles due to its limited distribution and challenging growing conditions. The plant has attracted interest from researchers for its potential medicinal properties and role in local ecosystems. Its conservation status highlights the need for further study and protection of this endangered species.</p>
