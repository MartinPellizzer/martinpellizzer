The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates.</p>
