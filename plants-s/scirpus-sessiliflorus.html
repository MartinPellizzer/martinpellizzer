<p>Scirpus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower bulrush, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it an ecologically important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Scirpus sessiliflorus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
