                    <h1>Sagina procumbens f. daviesii</h1>
<p>Sagina procumbens f. daviesii, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. It is often found in rocky crevices, stream banks, and woodland floors, where it forms dense, carpet-like patches.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to retain moisture and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
