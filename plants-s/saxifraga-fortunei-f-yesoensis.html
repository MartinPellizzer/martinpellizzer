The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
