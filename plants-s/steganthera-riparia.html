<p>Steganthera riparia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has feathery, floating fronds that are often used in water gardens and aquariums. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
