                    <h1>Sinobacopa aquatica</h1>
<p>Sinobacopa aquatica, commonly known as water bacopa, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its small, opposite leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped. It produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface.</p>
<p>Sinobacopa aquatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
