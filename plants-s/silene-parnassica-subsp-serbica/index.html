                            <h1>Silene Parnassica Subsp. Serbica</h1>
<p>Serbian campion, scientifically known as Silene parnassica subsp. serbica, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its pink or purple flowers and distinctive foliage, which make it a standout in its natural habitat. Found primarily in alpine and subalpine environments, this subspecies thrives in rocky soils and high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this beautiful and ecologically important plant.</p>
