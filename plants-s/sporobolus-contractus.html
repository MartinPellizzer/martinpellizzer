                    <h1>Sporobolus contractus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus contractus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clumping habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
