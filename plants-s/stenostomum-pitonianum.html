                    <h1>Stenostomum pitonianum</h1>
<p>Stenostomum pitonianum, commonly known as the Pitonian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southern Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps in reducing water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Stenostomum pitonianum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
