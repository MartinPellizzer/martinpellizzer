                    <h1>Sparganium chlorocarpum</h1>
<p>Sparganium chlorocarpum, commonly known as yellow bur-reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its yellowish-brown to reddish-brown spathes that enclose the spadix.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered within the spadix, which is covered by the modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Sparganium chlorocarpum is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
