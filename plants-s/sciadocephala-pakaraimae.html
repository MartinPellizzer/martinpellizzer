<p>Sciadocephala pakaraimae, commonly known as the Pakaraima ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species endemic to the Pakaraima Mountains in Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces striking, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments on rocky substrates, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
