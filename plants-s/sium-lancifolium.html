                    <h1>Sium lancifolium</h1>
<p>Sium lancifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine and are similar in appearance to parsnips.</p>
<p>Sium lancifolium thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
