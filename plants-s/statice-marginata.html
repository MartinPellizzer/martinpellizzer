                    <h1>Statice marginata</h1>
<p>Statice marginata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Statice marginata is a popular ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to bloom in poor soil conditions.</p>
