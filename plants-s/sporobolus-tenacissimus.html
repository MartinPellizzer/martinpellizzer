                    <h1>Sporobolus tenacissimus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus tenacissimus, commonly known as blackburr, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with leathery, hairless spikelets that are often adorned with bristly awns. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that contributes to its invasive potential in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus tenacissimus is adapted to poor soil conditions and is often found in dry, rocky areas or along roadsides.</p>
