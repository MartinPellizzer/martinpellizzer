                    <h1>Stelis maduroi</h1>
<p>Stelis maduroi, commonly known as the Maduro's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis maduroi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
