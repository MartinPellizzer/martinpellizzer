                    <h1>Scirpus sylvaticus var. compactus</h1>
<p>Scirpus sylvaticus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that typically range from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, triquetrous (three-angled) spikelets arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which are often greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in marshes, fens, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
