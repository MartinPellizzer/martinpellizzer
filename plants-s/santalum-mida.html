                    <h1>Santalum mida</h1>
<p>Santalum mida, commonly known as the Mida sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that belongs to the Santalaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role and limited distribution make it a subject of significant conservation interest.</p>
