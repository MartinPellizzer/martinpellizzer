                    <h1>Sibbaldia procumbens var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia procumbens var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense covering of fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a similar hairy texture, adapting to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to rocky and barren soils, thriving in conditions where few other plants can survive.</p>
