<p>Strychnos spireana, commonly known as the African spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and humans. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and savannas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores, which helps it survive in competitive environments.</p>
