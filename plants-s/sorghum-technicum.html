<p>Sorghum technicum, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is an annual plant that produces small, clustered inflorescences called panicles, which contain tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its seeds are rich in carbohydrates and are used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production.</p>
<p>Sorghum technicum is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
