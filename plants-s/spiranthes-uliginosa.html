                    <h1>Spiranthes uliginosa</h1>
<p>Spiranthes uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Spiranthes uliginosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
