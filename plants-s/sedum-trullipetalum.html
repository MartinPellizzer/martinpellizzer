                    <h1>Sedum trullipetalum</h1>
<p>Sedum trullipetalum, commonly known as the star-shaped stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to care for and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
