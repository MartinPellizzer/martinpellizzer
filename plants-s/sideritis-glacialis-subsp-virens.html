<p>Sideritis glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>virens, commonly known as the alpine ironwort, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
