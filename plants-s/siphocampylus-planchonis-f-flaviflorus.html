                    <h1>Siphocampylus planchonis f. flaviflorus</h1>
<p>Siphocampylus planchonis f. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered siphocampylus, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong, sweet scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
