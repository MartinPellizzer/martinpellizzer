                    <h1>Sorbus × saturejifolia</h1>
<p>Sorbus × saturejifolia, commonly known as the hybrid rowan or hybrid whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Sorbus aria (whitebeam) and Sorbus sanguinea (red rowan), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a rough texture, and they turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are red or orange in color, which are a key characteristic of the genus Sorbus.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
