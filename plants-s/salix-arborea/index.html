                            <h1>Salix Arborea</h1>
<p>Salix arborea, commonly known as the white willow, is a graceful tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. Its slender branches and cascading leaves create a soft, dappled canopy that makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This species is particularly noted for its early spring blooming, with delicate catkins appearing before the leaves fully emerge. The tree's bark is often covered in a soft, silvery-white flaky texture that adds to its visual appeal. Despite its beauty, Salix arborea is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
