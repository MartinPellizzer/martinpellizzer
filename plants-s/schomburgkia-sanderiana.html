                    <h1>Schomburgkia sanderiana</h1>
<p>Schomburgkia sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a valuable subject for botanical study.</p>
