<p>Salix × hippophaeifolia subsp.</p>
<p>trevirani, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in certain regions.</p>
