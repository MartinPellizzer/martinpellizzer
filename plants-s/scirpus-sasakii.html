<p>Scirpus sasakii, commonly known as the Japanese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. Scirpus sasakii thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it forms dense stands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological significance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
