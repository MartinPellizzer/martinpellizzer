<p>Scutellaria rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>rechingeri, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
