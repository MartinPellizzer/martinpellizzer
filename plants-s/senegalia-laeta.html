                    <h1>Senegalia laeta</h1>
<p>Senegalia laeta, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its thorny stems and compound leaves make it well adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Senegalia laeta is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock.</p>
