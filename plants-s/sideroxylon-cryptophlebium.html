                    <h1>Sideroxylon cryptophlebium</h1>
<p>Sideroxylon cryptophlebium, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark bark and hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or greenish. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable wood, it is often threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss.</p>
