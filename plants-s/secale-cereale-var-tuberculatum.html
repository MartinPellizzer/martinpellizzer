                    <h1>Secale cereale var. tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Secale cereale var. tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its distinctive tuberculate (knobbed) seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 60â€“120 cm, with dense, rough leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The tuberculate seeds are small, hard, and often used in traditional crafts or as a minor grain crop.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
