                    <h1>Salix bebbiana</h1>
<p>Salix bebbiana, commonly known as Bebb willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers, contributing to its wind-pollinated reproductive strategy. Bebb willow thrives in wet or moist environments, such as streambanks and wetlands, and is often found in the northern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
