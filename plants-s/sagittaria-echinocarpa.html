<p>Sagittaria echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense underwater stands. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, with the spikes bearing spiny bracts that give it its common name.</p>
