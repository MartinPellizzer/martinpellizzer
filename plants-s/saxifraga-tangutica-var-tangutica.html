<p>Saxifraga tangutica var. tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
