<p>Syngonanthus helminthorrhizus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular swamp cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and has a low, spreading habit with succulent, glandular-stemmed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated seed pods.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are a distinctive botanical feature, contributing to its adaptation to moist, often nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
