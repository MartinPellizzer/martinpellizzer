                    <h1>Sorbus barrandienica</h1>
<p>Sorbus barrandienica, commonly known as the Barrandian whitebeam, is a rare and ancient species of rowan native to the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in areas with moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
