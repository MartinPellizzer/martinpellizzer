<p>Stapelia × tricolor, commonly known as the three-color stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which are pollinated by flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Stapelia × tricolor is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
