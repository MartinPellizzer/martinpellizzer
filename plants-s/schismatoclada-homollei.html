<p>Schismatoclada homollei, commonly known as the Moroccan goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Schismatoclada homollei is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
