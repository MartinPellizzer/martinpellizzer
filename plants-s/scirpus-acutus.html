                    <h1>Scirpus acutus</h1>
<p>Scirpus acutus, commonly known as spiked bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Scirpus acutus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
