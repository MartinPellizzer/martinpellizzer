<p>Saxifraga stellaris, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga stellaris plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the alpine flora diversity.</p>
