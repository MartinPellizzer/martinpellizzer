<p>Scabrethia scabra subsp.</p>
<p>cinerea, commonly known as the grey scabrethia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that often appear greyish due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>

<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
