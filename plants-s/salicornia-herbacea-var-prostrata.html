                    <h1>Salicornia herbacea var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Salicornia herbacea var. prostrata, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other habitats with high salt content.</p>
<p>Its ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves makes it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems.</p>
