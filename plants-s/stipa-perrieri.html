<p>Stipa perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its fine texture and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Stipa perrieri is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments.</p>
