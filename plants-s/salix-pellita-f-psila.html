                    <h1>Salix pellita f. psila</h1>
<p>Salix pellita f. psila, commonly known as the silky willow, is a unique variant of the silky willow species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale green upper surface and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>It produces catkins in early spring, which are an important source of pollen for early pollinators.</p>
