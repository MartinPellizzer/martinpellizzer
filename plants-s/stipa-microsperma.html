<p>Stipa microsperma, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
