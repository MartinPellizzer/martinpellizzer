                <h1>Sticherus loheri</h1>
<p>Sticherus loheri, commonly known as the Loher's sticherus, is a rare and specialized liverwort species belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures that form dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded substrates. The plant exhibits a complex thallus with distinct lobes and papillae, which are adaptations for nutrient absorption in its habitat. It is typically found in temperate regions with high humidity and is often associated with decaying wood or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sticherus loheri is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
