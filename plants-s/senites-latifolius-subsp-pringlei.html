<p>Senites latifolius subsp.</p>
<p>pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's broadleaf senita, is a succulent cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
