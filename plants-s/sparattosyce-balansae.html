<p>Sparattosyce balansae, commonly known as the Balansae sparrowtail, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that resemble small sparrow tails. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers, which bloom in the spring, are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Sparattosyce balansae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
