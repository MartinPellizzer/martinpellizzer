                    <h1>Striga schimperiana</h1>
<p>Striga schimperiana, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to agricultural crops. It is native to Africa and is considered a major weed in regions where it infests crops like sorghum and millet.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and impact on agriculture, it is a subject of ongoing research for effective control methods.</p>
