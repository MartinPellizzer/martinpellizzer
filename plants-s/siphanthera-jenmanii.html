                    <h1>Siphanthera jenmanii</h1>
<p>Siphanthera jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Siphanthera jenmanii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
