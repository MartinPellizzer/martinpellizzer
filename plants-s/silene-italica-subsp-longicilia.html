<p>Silene italica subsp.</p>
<p>longicilia, commonly known as the Italian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking pink or red flowers with prominent stamens, which are a key feature in its pollination strategy. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, hairy filaments that give it its specific epithet "longicilia.".</p>
