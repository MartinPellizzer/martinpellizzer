<p>Suaeda rigida, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a halophyte plant adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in photosynthesis under harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or greenish, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Suaeda rigida plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
