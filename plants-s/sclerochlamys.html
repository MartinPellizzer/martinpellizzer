                    <h1>Sclerochlamys</h1>
<p>Sclerochlamys, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers and their ability to thrive in rocky or arid environments. Sclerochlamys species typically have thick, succulent leaves that help them store water, adapting to their often harsh habitats. The flowers are usually small to medium in size, with intricate structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized habitats, many Sclerochlamys species are rare and face threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
