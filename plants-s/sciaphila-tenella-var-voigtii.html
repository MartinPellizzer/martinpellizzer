<p>Sciaphila tenella var. voigtii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
