<p>Scirpus triqueter var. foliaceus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Scirpus triqueter.</p>
