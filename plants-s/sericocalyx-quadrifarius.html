<p>Sericocalyx quadrifarius, commonly known as the four-branch starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sericocalyx quadrifarius is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
