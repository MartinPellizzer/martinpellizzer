                    <h1>Saxifraga interrupta</h1>
<p>Saxifraga interrupta, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, often hairy, leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
