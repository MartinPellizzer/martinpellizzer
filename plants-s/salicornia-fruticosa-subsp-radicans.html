<p>Salicornia fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>radicans, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other wetlands with high salt content.</p>
<p>Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems.</p>
