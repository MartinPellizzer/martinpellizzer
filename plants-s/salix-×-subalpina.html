<p>Salix × subalpina, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a hybrid species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, often multi-stemmed branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination.</p>
<p>Salix × subalpina is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and poor soil, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
