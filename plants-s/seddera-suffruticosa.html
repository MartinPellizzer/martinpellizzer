                    <h1>Seddera suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Seddera suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its succulent leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Seddera suffruticosa is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
