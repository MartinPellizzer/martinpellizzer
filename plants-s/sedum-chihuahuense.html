<p>Sedum chihuahuense, commonly known as the Chihuahua stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
