                    <h1>Sarcocornia</h1>
<p>Sarcocornia, commonly known as glassworts, is a genus of halophytic plants that thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where they tolerate high salinity levels. Sarcocornia species often have succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss, an adaptation to their arid or saline habitats. The flowers are small and usually clustered, with some species producing edible seeds.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
