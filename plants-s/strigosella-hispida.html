                    <h1>Strigosella hispida</h1>
<p>Strigosella hispida, commonly known as the hairy strigosella, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and features slender, often hairy stems covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits containing minute seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Strigosella hispida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
