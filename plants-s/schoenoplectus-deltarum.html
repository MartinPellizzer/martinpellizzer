<p>Schoenoplectus deltarum, commonly known as delta bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and other water-saturated environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Schoenoplectus deltarum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and shelter.</p>
