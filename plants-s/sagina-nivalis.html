<p>Sagina nivalis, commonly known as snow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Sagina nivalis is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
