<p>Scleranthera dubia, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Scleranthera dubia is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
