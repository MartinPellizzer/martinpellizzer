<p>Salix glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
