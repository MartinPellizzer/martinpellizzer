                    <h1>Sporobolus subulatus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus subulatus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sharp, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Sporobolus subulatus is often found in grasslands, dunes, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
