                    <h1>Skofitzia boliviana</h1>
<p>Skofitzia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian skofitzia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Skofitzia boliviana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
