<p>Stylidium uniflorum subsp.</p>
<p>uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered triggerplant, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, which are typically bright red or orange, and its ability to rapidly close its leaves in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Plantaginaceae and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in coastal regions.</p>
