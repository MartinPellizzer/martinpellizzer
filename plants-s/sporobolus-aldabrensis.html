<p>Sporobolus aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Aldabra in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its robust, fibrous rhizomes and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sporobolus aldabrensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local fauna.</p>
