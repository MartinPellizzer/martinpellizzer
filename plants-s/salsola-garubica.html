<p>Salsola garubica, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, round, edible fruits. Salsola garubica is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
