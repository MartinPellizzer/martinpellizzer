                    <h1>Stylosanthes setosa</h1>
<p>Stylosanthes setosa, commonly known as slender stylosanthe, is a low-growing perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it produces trifoliate leaves with three small leaflets. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in dryland agriculture. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Stylosanthes setosa is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
