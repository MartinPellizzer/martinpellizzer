<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is both an ornamental and ecologically valuable plant in its native environment.</p>
