                    <h1>Stelis huebneri</h1>
<p>Stelis huebneri, commonly known as the HÃ¼bner's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Stelis huebneri is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
