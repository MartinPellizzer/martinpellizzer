<p>Salix hastatella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as riverbanks and marshes.</p>
<p>Salix hastatella is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species.</p>
