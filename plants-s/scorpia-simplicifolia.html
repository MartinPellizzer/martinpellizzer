                    <h1>Scorpia simplicifolia</h1>
<p>Scorpia simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf scorpion plant, is a unique species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, blooming in late spring. Its adaptations to drought include a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Scorpia simplicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
