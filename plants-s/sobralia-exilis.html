<p>Sobralia exilis, commonly known as the slender sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help collect moisture, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its flowers are often borne on tall, branching stems and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Sobralia exilis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
