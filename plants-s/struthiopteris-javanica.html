<p>Struthiopteris javanica, commonly known as the Javan shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that resembles a shield, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
