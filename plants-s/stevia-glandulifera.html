                    <h1>Stevia glandulifera</h1>
<p>Stevia glandulifera, commonly known as the sweet leaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, glandular structures. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing tiny seeds. Stevia glandulifera is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal and sweetening properties, it has been used traditionally in South American cultures for centuries.</p>
