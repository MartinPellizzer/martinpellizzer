<p>Stipa pennata subsp.</p>
<p>sabulosa, commonly known as the sand grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to golden florets. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
