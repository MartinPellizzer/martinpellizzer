<p>Sedum purdomii, commonly known as Purdom's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
