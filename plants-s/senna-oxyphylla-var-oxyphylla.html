<p>Senna oxyphylla var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the golden senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, narrow pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye due to its rich chemical composition.</p>
