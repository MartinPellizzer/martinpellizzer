<p>[WRONG START] Stegiearia montana, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Steigeria montana is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it forms dense mats.</p>
