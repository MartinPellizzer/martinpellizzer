<p>Selaginella societatis, commonly known as the Society's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils under shaded conditions, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
