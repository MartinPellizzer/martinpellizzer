                    <h1>Selaginella nutans var. capitata</h1>
<p>Selaginella nutans var. capitata, commonly known as the nodding spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tip of the stem. Its leaves are adapted for efficient water retention, a characteristic common in its arid habitats.</p>
<p>The species is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
