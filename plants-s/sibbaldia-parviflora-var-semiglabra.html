                    <h1>Sibbaldia parviflora var. semiglabra</h1>
<p>Sibbaldia parviflora var. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or alpine substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance.</p>
