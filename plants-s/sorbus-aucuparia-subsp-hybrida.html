<p>Sorbus aucuparia subsp.</p>
<p>hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5â€“9 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, bark, and seasonal color changes.</p>
