<p>Selago swynnertonii var. leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved selago, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its succulent, fleshy leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment.</p>
