                    <h1>Salix cordata var. mackenzieana</h1>
<p>Salix cordata var. mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie's willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its cold tolerance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
