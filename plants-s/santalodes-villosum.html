<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Santalodes villosum is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
