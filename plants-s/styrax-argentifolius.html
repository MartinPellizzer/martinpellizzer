                    <h1>Styrax argentifolius</h1>
<p>Styrax argentifolius, commonly known as silverleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its lance-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, waxy berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal foliage changes and unique fruiting habit.</p>
