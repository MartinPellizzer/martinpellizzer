                    <h1>Solanum ellipsoideibaccatum</h1>
<p>Solanum ellipsoideibaccatum, commonly known as the elliptic-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshades. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes.</p>
