                    <h1>Saxifraga hirsuta var. cuatrecasasii</h1>
<p>Saxifraga hirsuta var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is named in honor of the botanist Jos√© Cuatrecasas, who made significant contributions to the study of Mediterranean flora.</p>
