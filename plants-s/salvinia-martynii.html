<p>Salvinia martynii, commonly known as water fern or floating moss, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizomes that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Salvinia martynii is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
