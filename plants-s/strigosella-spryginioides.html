                    <h1>Strigosella spryginioides</h1>
<p>Strigosella spryginioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
