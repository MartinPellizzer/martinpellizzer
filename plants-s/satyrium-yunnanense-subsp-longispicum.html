<p>Satyrium yunnanense subsp.</p>
<p>longispicum, commonly known as the Yunnan long-spurred orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its elongated, spurred lip that extends beyond the column, a distinctive feature among orchid species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude forest understories, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
