                    <h1>Statice tenuicula</h1>
<p>Statice tenuicula, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and coastal sands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Statice tenuicula is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
