<p>Selaginella axillifolia var. retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory plant communities in its native habitat.</p>
