                    <h1>Stapelia pillansii</h1>
<p>Stapelia pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans' Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, resembling the appearance of a corpse, which is a common trait among stapelias. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the plant's strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Stapelia pillansii is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
