                <h1>Solanum nigrum</h1>
<p>Solanum nigrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which mature to a dark purple or black color. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids in their raw form, making them potentially harmful if consumed unripe or in large quantities.</p>
<p>Solanum nigrum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
