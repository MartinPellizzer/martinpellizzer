                    <h1>Salvia membranacea</h1>
<p>Salvia membranacea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, sky-blue to lavender flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
<p>Salvia membranacea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
