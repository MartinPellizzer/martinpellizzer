<p>Sarcopodium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu sarcopodium, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy underground tuberous roots. The plant produces a solitary, erect stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called an umbel, which is surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
