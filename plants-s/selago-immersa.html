                    <h1>Selago immersa</h1>
<p>Selago immersa, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its submerged leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, while its floating leaves are broader and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Selago immersa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
