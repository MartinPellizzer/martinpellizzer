                    <h1>Senecio squalidus var. aethnensis</h1>
<p>Senecio squalidus var. aethnensis, commonly known as the Aethna senecio, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Senecio squalidus.</p>
