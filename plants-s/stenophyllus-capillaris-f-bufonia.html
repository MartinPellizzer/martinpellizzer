                    <h1>Stenophyllus capillaris f. bufonia</h1>
<p>Stenophyllus capillaris f. bufonia, commonly known as the bufonia form, is a variant of the Stenophyllus capillaris, a species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>This particular form is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, narrow leaves with a slightly curled margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a creeping growth habit, which help it thrive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The bufonia form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
