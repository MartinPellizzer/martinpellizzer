                    <h1>Struthanthus thyrsiflorus</h1>
<p>Struthanthus thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to harsh desert environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
