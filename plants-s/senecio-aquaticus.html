<p>Senecio aquaticus, commonly known as water groundsel, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, often semi-shaded conditions. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. It is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
