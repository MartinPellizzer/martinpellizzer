                    <h1>Salix characta</h1>
<p>Salix characta, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers.</p>
<p>Salix characta is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
