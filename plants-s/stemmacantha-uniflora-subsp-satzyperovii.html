<p>Stemmacantha uniflora subsp.</p>
<p>satzyperovii, commonly known as the Zambian starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found growing in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
