                    <h1>Solanum oleraceum var. macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Solanum oleraceum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited nightshade, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible berries, which are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature.</p>
<p>These berries are often used in traditional cuisines, though they contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid that requires careful preparation.</p>
