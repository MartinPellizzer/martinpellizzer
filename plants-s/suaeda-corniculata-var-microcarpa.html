                    <h1>Suaeda corniculata var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Suaeda corniculata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sea bladder, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, green leaves that store water, typical of plants in arid or coastal regions. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in high-salinity and low-nutrient conditions.</p>
