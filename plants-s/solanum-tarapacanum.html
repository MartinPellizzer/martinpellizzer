<p>Solanum tarapacanum, commonly known as the Atacama nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its small, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species.</p>
<p>Solanum tarapacanum is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions due to its drought-resistant properties.</p>
