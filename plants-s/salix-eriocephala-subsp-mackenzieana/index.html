                            <h1>Salix Eriocephala Subsp. Mackenzieana</h1>
<p>Salix eriocephala subsp. mackenzieana is a rare and hardy shrub native to the arctic and subarctic regions of northern North America. This subspecies is known for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. It features small, rounded leaves and produces fluffy, white catkins that appear in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or lakes. Due to its limited range and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
