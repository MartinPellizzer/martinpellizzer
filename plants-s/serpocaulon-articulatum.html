<p>Serpocaulon articulatum, commonly known as the segmented liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and segmented, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves.</p>
