                    <h1>Syngonanthus androgynus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus androgynus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to exude a dark, sticky resin from its bark, which helps in preventing saltwater from entering its roots. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a waxy surface. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Syngonanthus androgynus is also notable for its adaptation to saline environments, making it a key component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
