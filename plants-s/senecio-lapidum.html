                    <h1>Senecio lapidum</h1>
<p>Senecio lapidum, commonly known as the stone lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its scientific name reflects its association with stone-like habitats, and it is often found in rocky soils and crevices.</p>
<p>Senecio lapidum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples.</p>
