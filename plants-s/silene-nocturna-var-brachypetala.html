                    <h1>Silene nocturna var. brachypetala</h1>
<p>Silene nocturna var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petalled evening pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom at night. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cooler, high-altitude environments where it thrives. This variant is distinguished by its shorter petals compared to the typical form of Silene nocturna.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
