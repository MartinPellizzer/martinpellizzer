                    <h1>Spartina stricta var. townsendii</h1>
<p>Spartina stricta var. townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's cordgrass, is a perennial grass that thrives in brackish and salt marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting crystals. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. It is particularly adapted to tidal zones, where it tolerates periodic flooding and high salinity.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
