                    <h1>Sagina olympica</h1>
<p>Sagina olympica, commonly known as the Olympic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters, blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>Sagina olympica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
