                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos cataractorum</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos cataractorum, commonly known as the weeping star, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, drooping inflorescences that resemble miniature waterfalls, composed of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant features succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
