<p>Stenorrhynchos albovaginatum, commonly known as the white-barked stenorrhynchos, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures.</p>
