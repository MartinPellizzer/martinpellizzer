                    <h1>Salix finalis</h1>
<p>Salix finalis, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silvery down that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
