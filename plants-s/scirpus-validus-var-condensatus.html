                    <h1>Scirpus validus var. condensatus</h1>
<p>Scirpus validus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. This variety is adapted to grow in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
