<p>Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp.</p>
<p>hippolyti, commonly known as the lake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, lake margins, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
