                    <h1>Selaginella microphylla f. culcitrella</h1>
<p>Selaginella microphylla f. culcitrella, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a compact, low-growing fern ally native to arid and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged along its stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to enter dormancy during periods of water scarcity.</p>
<p>This fern ally is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
