                    <h1>Serpocaulon × orosiense</h1>
<p>Serpocaulon × orosiense, commonly known as the Orosi hybrid, is a rare and unique hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Serpocaulon annuum and Serpocaulon ramosum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Serpocaulon × orosiense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
