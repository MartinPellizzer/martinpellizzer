<p>Saxifraga iochanensis, commonly known as the Kashmir saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, often succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.
