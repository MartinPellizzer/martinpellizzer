                    <h1>Syngonanthus dealbatus var. minor</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus dealbatus var. minor, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white, waxy flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
