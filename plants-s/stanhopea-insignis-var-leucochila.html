                    <h1>Stanhopea insignis var. leucochila</h1>
<p>Stanhopea insignis var. leucochila, commonly known as the white-lipped stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with prominent, contrasting lip petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, adapted for pollination by specific insects such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
