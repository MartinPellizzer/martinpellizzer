                    <h1>Stellaria graminea var. fragilis</h1>
<p>Stellaria graminea var. fragilis, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat on the ground. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its fragile stems and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties.</p>
