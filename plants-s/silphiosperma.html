                    <h1>Silphiosperma</h1>
<p>Silphiosperma, commonly known as the silphium plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its distinctive composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrived in dry, rocky soils, often growing along coastal areas. The plant features a tall, branching stem with narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Silphiosperma was historically cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly for its resin, which was valued in ancient times.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered extinct in the wild.</p>
