                <h1>Salicornia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Salicornia fruticosa, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and the stems are rich in salt, which helps the plant tolerate high salinity.</p>
<p>Salicornia fruticosa is also used in some culinary traditions and has applications in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate salts.</p>
