                    <h1>Santalum insulare var. deckeri</h1>
<p>Santalum insulare var. deckeri, commonly known as the Christmas Island sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic tree that relies on other plants for part of its nutrient intake, while still performing photosynthesis. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, aromatic bark and dark green, glossy leaves. Its small, white flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
