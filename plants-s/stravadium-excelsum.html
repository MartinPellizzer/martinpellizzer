                    <h1>Stravadium excelsum</h1>
<p>Stravadium excelsum, commonly known as the celestial spire, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its towering, spiral-shaped stems that can reach heights of up to 30 feet. The plant produces small, luminescent blue flowers that bloom only during the summer solstice. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the arid environment.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in its unique photosynthetic properties, which allow it to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
