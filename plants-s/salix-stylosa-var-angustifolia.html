                    <h1>Salix stylosa var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Salix stylosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the development of leaves. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration projects.</p>
