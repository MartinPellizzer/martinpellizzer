<p>Sedum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Sedum capitatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
