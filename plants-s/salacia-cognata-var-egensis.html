<p>Salacia cognata var. egensis, commonly known as the Egen's salacia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that twine around supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are known for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
