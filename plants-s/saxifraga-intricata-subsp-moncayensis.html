<p>Saxifraga intricata subsp.</p>
<p>moncayensis, commonly known as the Andean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms a mat-like structure to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
