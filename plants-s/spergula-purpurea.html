<p>Spergula purpurea, commonly known as purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Spergula purpurea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its tolerance to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
