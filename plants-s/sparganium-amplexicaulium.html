                    <h1>Sparganium amplexicaulium</h1>
<p>Sparganium amplexicaulium, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lake margins, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are tightly wrapped around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its most notable characteristic is the production of spiky, spherical clusters of fruits that mature into dry, brown burrs.</p>
<p>These burrs can trap small animals and are often used in ecological studies to assess water quality and habitat health.</p>
