                    <h1>Scleria cyperina</h1>
<p>Scleria cyperina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with the lower portion being male and the upper portion female. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a distinct midrib, contributing to its sedge-like morphology.</p>
<p>Scleria cyperina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in wetland ecosystems.</p>
