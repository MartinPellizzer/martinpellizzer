                    <h1>Sobralia pardalina</h1>
<p>Sobralia pardalina, commonly known as the pink sobralia, is a striking orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly found in regions of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink or red flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow or green markings. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, with each flower having a distinctive lip that is typically more brightly colored than the rest of the flower. Sobralia pardalina thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an ornamental plant and its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators.</p>
