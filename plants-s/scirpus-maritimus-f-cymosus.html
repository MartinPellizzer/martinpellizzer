<p>Scirpus maritimus f. cymosus, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in brackish or saltwater marshes, demonstrating a high tolerance for saline conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The cymose inflorescence structure is a distinguishing feature of this form, setting it apart from other Scirpus species.</p>
