                    <h1>Scyphostelma longecalicinum</h1>
<p>Scyphostelma longecalicinum, commonly known as the long-stalked starry bell, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often protected in its native habitats.</p>
