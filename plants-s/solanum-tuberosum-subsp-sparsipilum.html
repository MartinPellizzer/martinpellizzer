<p>Solanum tuberosum subsp.</p>
<p>sparsipilum, commonly known as the sparsely-hairy potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its sparse pubescence on the stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other subspecies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Andes region of South America, where it grows in cooler, high-altitude environments. The tubers are typically smaller and have a slightly different texture compared to the more widely cultivated varieties.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific ecological conditions.</p>
