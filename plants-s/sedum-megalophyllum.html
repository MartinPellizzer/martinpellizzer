<p>Sedum megalophyllum, commonly known as the giant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rosette growth pattern and ability to form clumps make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Sedum megalophyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in desert ecosystems.</p>
