<p>Scorpiurus subvillosus var. breviaculeatus, commonly known as the short-stalked spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and opposite leaves.</p>
<p>It typically produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with its succulent tissues storing water. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Scorpiurus subvillosus var. breviaculeatus is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of environmental stress.</p>
