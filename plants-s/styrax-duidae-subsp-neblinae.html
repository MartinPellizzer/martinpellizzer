<p>Styrax duidae subsp.</p>
<p>neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina styrax, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of northern South America. This plant is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, adapting well to the humid and shaded conditions of its habitat. The bark of the Neblina styrax contains aromatic compounds, which have been used traditionally by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
