                    <h1>Salix eriocaulos</h1>
<p>Salix eriocaulos, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies.</p>
<p>Salix eriocaulos is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
