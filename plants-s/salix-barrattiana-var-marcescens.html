                    <h1>Salix barrattiana var. marcescens</h1>
<p>Salix barrattiana var. marcescens, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that often retain their reddish color well into winter. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is typically smooth and reddish-brown. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves and twigs are commonly used in traditional basket-weaving and other crafts by indigenous peoples.</p>
