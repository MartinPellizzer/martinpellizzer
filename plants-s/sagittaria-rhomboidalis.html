                    <h1>Sagittaria rhomboidalis</h1>
<p>Sagittaria rhomboidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sagittaria rhomboidalis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
