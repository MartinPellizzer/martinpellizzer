                    <h1>Selaginella rupestris var. sherwoodii</h1>
<p>Selaginella rupestris var. sherwoodii, commonly known as the Sherwood's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant possesses a unique ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions due to its desiccation-tolerant spores and specialized leaf anatomy. Its reproductive structures, including strobili, are small and inconspicuous, typical of the Selaginellaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils.</p>
