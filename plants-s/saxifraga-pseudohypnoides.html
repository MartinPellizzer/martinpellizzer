                    <h1>Saxifraga pseudohypnoides</h1>
<p>Saxifraga pseudohypnoides, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, covered in a fine layer of white hair that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Saxifraga pseudohypnoides is valued for its resilience and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
