                    <h1>Strephonema pseudocola</h1>
<p>Strephonema pseudocola, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, and it is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
