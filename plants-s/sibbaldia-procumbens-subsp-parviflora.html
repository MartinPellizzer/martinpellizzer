<p>Sibbaldia procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems covered in fine, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and its role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems.</p>
