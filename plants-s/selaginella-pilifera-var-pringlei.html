                    <h1>Selaginella pilifera var. pringlei</h1>
<p>Selaginella pilifera var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that are typically clustered around a central axis, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in terminal clusters, a feature typical of many spikemosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
