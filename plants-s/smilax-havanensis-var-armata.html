<p>Smilax havanensis var. armata, commonly known as the Cuban arrowroot or spiny smilax, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and stout, spiny tendrils that help it climb and support itself. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive veining pattern.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
