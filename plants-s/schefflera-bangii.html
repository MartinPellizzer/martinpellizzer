<p>Schefflera bangii, commonly known as the silver star plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Schefflera bangii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
