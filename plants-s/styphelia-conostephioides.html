<p>Styphelia conostephioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate beauty to its habitat. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
