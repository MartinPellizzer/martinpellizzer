<p>Sciodaphyllum digynum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that bear small, delicate pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures are unique, with separate male and female gametophytes, a feature that reflects its primitive evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum digynum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
