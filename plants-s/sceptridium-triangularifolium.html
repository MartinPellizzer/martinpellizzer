                    <h1>Sceptridium triangularifolium</h1>
<p>Sceptridium triangularifolium, commonly known as the triangular-leaf clubmoss, is a species of small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered in dense, cone-like structures at the base of the stems. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, offering insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
