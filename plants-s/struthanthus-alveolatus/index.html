                            <h1>Struthanthus Alveolatus</h1>
<p>Struthanthus alveolatus is a rare and striking member of the Loasaceae family native to the deserts of the southwestern United States. This plant is known for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to its arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices where it can conserve moisture. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered due to habitat loss. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
