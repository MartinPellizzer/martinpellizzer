<p>Sphaeropteris mesosora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, short trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
