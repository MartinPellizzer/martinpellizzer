<p>Selaginella nanuzae, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern ally native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella nanuzae is known for its ability to reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
