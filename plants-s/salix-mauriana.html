<p>Salix mauriana, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>The bark of Salix mauriana is smooth and grayish, with some varieties developing a reddish tint as they mature.</p>
