<p>Spiranthes lacera var. lacera, commonly known as the slender ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates.</p>
