<p>Spinulum annotinum subsp.</p>
<p>alpestre, commonly known as the alpine spinulum, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its compact growth form and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
