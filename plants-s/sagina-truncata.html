<p>Sagina truncata, commonly known as common snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that turns red as it matures, containing several tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Sagina truncata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
