<p>Stathmostelma fornicatum subsp.</p>
<p>fornicatum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, typically arranged in a raceme.</p>
<p>The plant is native to specific regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
