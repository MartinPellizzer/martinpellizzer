                    <h1>Sedum trientaloides</h1>
<p>Sedum trientaloides, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
