                    <h1>Sonchus canadensis</h1>
<p>Sonchus canadensis, commonly known as Canadian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to persist through harsh conditions and making it invasive in many regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
