                    <h1>Schoenus spadiceus</h1>
<p>Schoenus spadiceus, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Schoenus spadiceus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
