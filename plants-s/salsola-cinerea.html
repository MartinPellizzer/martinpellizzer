<p>Salsola cinerea, commonly known as silver leaf gooseweed, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts, coastal areas, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Salsola cinerea is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
