<p>Scirpus glomeratus, commonly known as clustered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist soils.</p>
<p>Scirpus glomeratus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
