                    <h1>Saxifraga globulifera var. granatensis</h1>
<p>Saxifraga globulifera var. granatensis, commonly known as the granate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bright red flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
