                    <h1>Selaginella radicans var. suberecta</h1>
<p>Selaginella radicans var. suberecta, commonly known as the upright clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to moist, shaded environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branching stems that often form dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, typical of the spore-producing plants in the Lycopodiophyta division.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its upright growth habit, which differentiates it from the more sprawling form of the typical Selaginella radicans.</p>
