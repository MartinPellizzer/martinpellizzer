<p>Saxifraga gouldii, commonly known as Gould's saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Saxifraga gouldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging ecological niches.</p>
