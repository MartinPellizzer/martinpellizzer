                    <h1>Sandoricum venosum</h1>
<p>Sandoricum venosum, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, sweet scent and was historically used in perfumes and traditional crafts.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
