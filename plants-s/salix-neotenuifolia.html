                    <h1>Salix neotenuifolia</h1>
<p>Salix neotenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, making it a common species in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>
