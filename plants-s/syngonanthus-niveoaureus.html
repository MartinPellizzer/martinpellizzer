                    <h1>Syngonanthus niveoaureus</h1>
<p>Syngonanthus niveoaureus, commonly known as the silver-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time if left unchecked.</p>
