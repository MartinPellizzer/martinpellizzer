<p>Saxifraga hostii, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rosette-shaped, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Saxifraga hostii is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
