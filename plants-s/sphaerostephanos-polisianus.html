                    <h1>Sphaerostephanos polisianus</h1>
<p>Sphaerostephanos polisianus, commonly known as the Polisianus starflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a compact inflorescence. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
