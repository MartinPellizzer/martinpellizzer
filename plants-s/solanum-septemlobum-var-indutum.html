<p>Solanum septemlobum var. indutum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple or black color, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, where it can become a weed.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans.</p>
