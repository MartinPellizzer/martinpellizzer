                    <h1>Solanum canasense var. xerophyllum</h1>
<p>Solanum canasense var. xerophyllum, commonly known as the Xerophyllum nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, containing toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to drought, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils with low moisture availability.</p>
