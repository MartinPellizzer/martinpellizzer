                    <h1>Salix coeruleiformis</h1>
<p>Salix coeruleiformis, commonly known as the sky-blue willow, is a rare and distinctive species of willow native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale green to sky-blue leaves that give it its unique appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in alpine meadows or rocky slopes. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salix coeruleiformis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
