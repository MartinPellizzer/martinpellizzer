                    <h1>Selenodesmium tereticaulum</h1>
<p>Selenodesmium tereticaulum, commonly known as the slender spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly coiled, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its simple, undifferentiated structure reflects its adaptation to low-light, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Selenodesmium tereticaulum is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of cryptogamic communities.</p>
