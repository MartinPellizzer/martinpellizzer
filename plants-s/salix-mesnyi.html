                    <h1>Salix mesnyi</h1>
<p>Salix mesnyi, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix mesnyi is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for local wildlife in its native range.</p>
