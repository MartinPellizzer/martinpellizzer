                    <h1>Stelis puberula</h1>
<p>Stelis puberula, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, upright pseudobulbs covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow, and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Stelis puberula is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
