<p>Sorbus aucuparia subf.</p>
<p>stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
