                    <h1>Stephostachys mertensii</h1>
<p>Stephostachys mertensii, commonly known as the desert sand mat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Stephostachys mertensii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
