<p>Schoenocaulon intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The yellow flowers bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
