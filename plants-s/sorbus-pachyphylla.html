<p>Sorbus pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
