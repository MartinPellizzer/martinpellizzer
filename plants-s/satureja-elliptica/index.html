                            <h1>Satureja Elliptica</h1>
<p>Greek thyme, scientifically known as Satureja elliptica, is a hardy herb native to the rocky landscapes of Greece and the Mediterranean region. This aromatic plant is prized for its distinctive scent and culinary versatility, often used to flavor dishes and brew traditional teas. With small, oval-shaped leaves and delicate pink or white flowers, it adds both visual appeal and fragrance to gardens. Its resilience to drought and poor soil makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Despite its modest appearance, Greek thyme holds cultural and medicinal significance in ancient and modern herbal practices.</p>
