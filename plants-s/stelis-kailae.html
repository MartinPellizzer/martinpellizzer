<p>Stelis kailae, commonly known as the Kaila's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescence and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its habitat is often limited to specific elevations and microclimates, making it highly susceptible to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Stelis kailae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
