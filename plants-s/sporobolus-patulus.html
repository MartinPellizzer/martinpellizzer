                    <h1>Sporobolus patulus</h1>
<p>Sporobolus patulus, commonly known as the slender sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and tufted, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a trait that contributes to its success in colonizing disturbed or open areas.</p>
<p>Sporobolus patulus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range.</p>
