<p>Solidago humilis f. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well-suited for high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in alpine ecosystems.</p>
