<p>Sedum fui var. longisepalum, commonly known as the long-sepal sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically in summer. Its long, narrow sepals give it its specific name, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
