                    <h1>Strumaria phonolithica</h1>
<p>Strumaria phonolithica, commonly known as the soundstone bellflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the mineral-rich regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and a peculiar ability to respond to sound vibrations, which it uses to attract pollinators. The plant's structure includes a hollow, bell-shaped corolla that amplifies acoustic signals, enhancing its interaction with its environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb minerals from the rocky soil, contributing to its specialized growth.</p>
<p>This rare species is a subject of botanical interest due to its unusual sensory adaptations and ecological niche.</p>
