<p>Steiropteris deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome produces roots that help anchor it to the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
