                <h1>Silene depressa</h1>
<p>Silene depressa, commonly known as the Downy Catchfly, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and gravelly areas. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Silene depressa is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy, clustered flowers and succulent-like stems.</p>
