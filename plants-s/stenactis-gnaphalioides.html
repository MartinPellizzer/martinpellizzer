                    <h1>Stenactis gnaphalioides</h1>
<p>Stenactis gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial herb with succulent, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Stenactis gnaphalioides is often found in disturbed sites, such as along roadsides and in rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
