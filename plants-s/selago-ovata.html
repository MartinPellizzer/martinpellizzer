                    <h1>Selago ovata</h1>
<p>Selago ovata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Selago ovata is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
