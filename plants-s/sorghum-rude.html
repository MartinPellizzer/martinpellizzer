                    <h1>Sorghum rude</h1>
<p>Sorghum rude, commonly known as johnsongrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa and widely naturalized in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other sorghum species.</p>
