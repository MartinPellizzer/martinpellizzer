                    <h1>Sporobolus leptostachys</h1>
<p>Sporobolus leptostachys, commonly known as slender spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Sporobolus leptostachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
