                    <h1>Spergularia marginata var. monticola</h1>
<p>Spergularia marginata var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh, dry climates and is an important component of high-altitude vegetation.</p>
