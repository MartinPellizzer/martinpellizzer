<p>Sorbus decurrens, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Sorbus decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environments.</p>
