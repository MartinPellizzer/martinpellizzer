                    <h1>Salix brachycarpa var. alticola</h1>
<p>Salix brachycarpa var. alticola, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems, it is often used in restoration projects in mountainous regions.</p>
