                    <h1>Salix austrotibetica</h1>
<p>Salix austrotibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
