                    <h1>Strophocactus krammii</h1>
<p>Strophocactus krammii, commonly known as the Kramm's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its thick, spiny stems are adapted to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Strophocactus krammii is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal care once established.</p>
