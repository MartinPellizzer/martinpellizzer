                    <h1>Secale × derzhavinii</h1>
<p>Secale × derzhavinii, commonly known as the hybrid rye-grass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between rye (Secale cereale) and true grasses (Poaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and panicles of small, greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability. It does not produce viable seeds, which limits its natural spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for understanding hybridization in grass species.</p>
