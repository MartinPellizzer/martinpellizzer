<p>Stapeliopsis madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to form offsets, which can be used for propagation.</p>
