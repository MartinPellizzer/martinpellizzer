                    <h1>Symplocos patens var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Symplocos patens var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal name "ciliata" refers to the hairy margins of its leaves, a key identifying feature.</p>
