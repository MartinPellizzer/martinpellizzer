<p>Silene keiskei f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sandverbena, is a variant of the sandverbena species native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The pale coloration of its flowers distinguishes it from the more typical pink or red varieties of the species.</p>
