                    <h1>Schizacme</h1>
<p>Schizacme, commonly known as the "buttercup" or "false buttercup," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. Schizacme species typically have basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and their stems are usually hairy. They are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
