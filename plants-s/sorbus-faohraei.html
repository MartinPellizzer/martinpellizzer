<p>Sorbus faohraei, commonly known as the Bornean whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus faohraei is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
