                    <h1>Sparganium stoloniferum var. coreanum</h1>
<p>Sparganium stoloniferum var. coreanum, commonly known as the Korean bur reed, is a perennial wetland plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical spikes of yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the stems are covered in spiny bracts that give it its common name.</p>
