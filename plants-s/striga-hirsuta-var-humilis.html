                    <h1>Striga hirsuta var. humilis</h1>
<p>Striga hirsuta var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests the roots of grasses and cereal crops.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched root system that attaches to the host's roots. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
