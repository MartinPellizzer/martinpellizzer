                    <h1>Spergula humifusa</h1>
<p>Spergula humifusa, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Spergula humifusa is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
