<p>Saxifraga presolanensis, commonly known as the Andean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its alpine environment. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Saxifraga presolanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
