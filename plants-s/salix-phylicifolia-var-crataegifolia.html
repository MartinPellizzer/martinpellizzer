                    <h1>Salix phylicifolia var. crataegifolia</h1>
<p>Salix phylicifolia var. crataegifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
