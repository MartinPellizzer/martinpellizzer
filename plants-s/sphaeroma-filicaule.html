<p>Sphaeroma filicaule, commonly known as the leafy sea dragon, is a species of sea dragon found in the coastal waters of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a marine animal belonging to the family Syngnathidae, which includes seahorses and pipefish. The plant-like appearance of Sphaeroma filicaule is due to its elaborate, branched appendages that resemble foliage. It is characterized by its translucent, leafy structures that provide camouflage in seaweed beds.</p>
<p>These appendages are not true leaves but are modified dorsal fin rays that aid in swimming and protection.</p>
