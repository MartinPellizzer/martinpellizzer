                    <h1>Sporobolus rigidifolius</h1>
<p>Sporobolus rigidifolius, commonly known as rigid leaf sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically borne on short, ascending stems. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Sporobolus rigidifolius is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a common component of desert and grassland ecosystems.</p>
