                    <h1>Schizoloma clavatum</h1>
<p>Schizoloma clavatum, commonly known as the clustered star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and the presence of distinctive, star-shaped thallus structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including the leafy shoots and capsules, are adapted for spore dispersal in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schizoloma clavatum is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
