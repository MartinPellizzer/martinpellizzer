                    <h1>Scirpus minaae</h1>
<p>Scirpus minaae, commonly known as the African bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and can help in filtering water, making it ecologically significant in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Scirpus minaae is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching material in some regions.</p>
