                    <h1>Schizaea orbicularis</h1>
<p>Schizaea orbicularis, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Schizaea orbicularis has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage, reflecting its ancient evolutionary lineage.</p>
