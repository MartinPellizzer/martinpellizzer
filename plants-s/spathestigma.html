                    <h1>Spathestigma</h1>
<p>Spathestigma, commonly known as the "spathestigma" or sometimes referred to as the "spathe stigma," is a specialized floral structure found in certain monocot plants.</p>
<p>It consists of a modified leaf-like structure called a spathe, which encloses the actual flower, or inflorescence. The spathe often serves to protect the reproductive organs, including the stigma, which is typically located at the base of the spathe. In some species, the spathe may also play a role in attracting pollinators through its color or shape.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature is particularly prominent in plants such as certain species of Araceae, where it contributes to the plant's reproductive success.</p>
