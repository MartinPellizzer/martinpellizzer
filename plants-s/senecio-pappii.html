<p>Senecio pappii, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, fluffy clusters that resemble a tuft of cotton. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Senecio pappii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
