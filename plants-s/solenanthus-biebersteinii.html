                    <h1>Solenanthus biebersteinii</h1>
<p>Solenanthus biebersteinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salinity. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Solenanthus biebersteinii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
