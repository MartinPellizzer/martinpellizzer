                    <h1>Schoenoplectus triqueter var. segregatus</h1>
<p>Schoenoplectus triqueter var. segregatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other forms of Schoenoplectus triqueter by its narrower leaves and slightly different growth habits.</p>
