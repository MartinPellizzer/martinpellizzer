                    <h1>Solanum medusae</h1>
<p>Solanum medusae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the nightshade family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces large, bell-shaped flowers that are pale green with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Solanum medusae is notable for its unique morphology and is often considered a botanical curiosity due to its unusual appearance.</p>
