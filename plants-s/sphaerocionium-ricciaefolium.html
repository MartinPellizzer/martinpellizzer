<p>Sphaerocionium ricciaefolium, commonly known as the Riccia-like liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structure with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that form a dense, cushion-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Sphaerocionium ricciaefolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
