                    <h1>Solanum multifolium</h1>
<p>Solanum multifolium, commonly known as the many-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering display.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
