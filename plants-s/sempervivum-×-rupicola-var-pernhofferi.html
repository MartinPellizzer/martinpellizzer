<p>Sempervivum × rupicola var. pernhofferi, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and compact form make it an ideal specimen plant for containers or alpine settings.</p>
