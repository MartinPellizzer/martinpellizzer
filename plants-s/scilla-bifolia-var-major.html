                    <h1>Scilla bifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Scilla bifolia var. major, commonly known as the giant scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features grass-like basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its larger size compared to the typical Scilla bifolia, with more robust stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate, early-blooming flowers and its ability to naturalize over time.</p>
