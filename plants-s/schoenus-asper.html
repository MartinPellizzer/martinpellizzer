<p>Schoenus asper, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, three-lobed flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
