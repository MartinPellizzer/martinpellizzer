<p>Sipaneopsis pacimonensis, commonly known as the Pacimonense Sipaneopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in the understory of dense rainforests. Its leaves are large, ovate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in the moist, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
