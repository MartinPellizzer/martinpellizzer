                    <h1>Sisarum palustre</h1>
<p>Sisarum palustre, commonly known as marsh morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it an aggressive colonizer in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Sisarum palustre is also noted for its showy flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
