<p>Selago viscosa, commonly known as sticky selago, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>The sticky resin has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes.</p>
