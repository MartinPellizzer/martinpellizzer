<p>Sapium anadenum, commonly known as the Mexican flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered spikes during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Sapium anadenum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged soils.</p>
