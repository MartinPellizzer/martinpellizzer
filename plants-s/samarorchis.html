                    <h1>Samarorchis</h1>
<p>Samarorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white, leaf-like structures that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often resembling a ghostly appearance. Samarorchis thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments such as pine rocklands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
