<p>Sedum soluntinum, commonly known as the Soluntine Stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial succulent that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sedum soluntinum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
