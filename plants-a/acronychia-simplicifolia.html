                <h1>Acronychia simplicifolia</h1>
<p>Acronychia simplicifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved acronychia, is a tropical tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia simplicifolia has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length and have a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows as a small shrub or tree. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, with five petals and stamens; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia simplicifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with well-drained sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in coastal and inland areas, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the hot and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acronychia simplicifolia is also occasionally found in New Guinea and some nearby islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia simplicifolia was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Queensland and New South Wales, often growing in dense thickets or along the edges of rainforests. This species is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and wind exposure. It plays a significant role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
