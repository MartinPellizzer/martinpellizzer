                <h1>Aechmea glomerata</h1>
<p>Aechmea glomerata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the center. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in fine, hair-like structures.</p>
<p>Aechmea glomerata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea glomerata has rosette-shaped leaves that are wide, fleshy, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a bluish-green to silver-gray color due to a dense layer of trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is formed by tightly packed leaf bases that create a rosette structure. The flowers are clustered in a dense, spiky inflorescence, with white or pale pink bracts that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are short and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
