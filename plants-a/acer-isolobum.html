                <h1>Acer isolobum</h1>
<p>Acer isolobum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer isolobum typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters and thrives in a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of the United States and Europe, where it is grown in botanical gardens and arboretums. It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions, typically found in mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer isolobum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and relatively compact size, making it a popular ornamental choice.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer isolobum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer isolobum contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its bark and leaves, which contain compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It has minimal industrial applications due to its small size and limited timber yield, though it contributes to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic value in indigenous communities, representing resilience or natural beauty. Its role in ecological restoration and habitat support makes it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer isolobum plays a niche but significant role in both ecological and cultural systems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumnalis' and 'Crimson Queen,' which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also produces hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture. These cultivars and hybrids are often used in landscape design for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates. Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to enhance garden aesthetics with seasonal interest.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer isolobum remains a valuable addition to the collection of ornamental trees due to its unique characteristics and versatility.</p>
