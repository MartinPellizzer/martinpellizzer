                <h1>Acer isolobum</h1>
<p>Acer isolobum, commonly known as the Sierra maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive red to orange-red foliage in the fall. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant shades of red and yellow during autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to its native habitat in moist, temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions, typically growing in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The species is considered endangered due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer isolobum involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil structure and supporting a diverse ecosystem. Its roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for small mammals and reptiles.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage and autumn coloration.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in traditional medicine, some local communities may use parts of the plant for minor therapeutic purposes. Its wood is not commonly used in industrial applications due to its softness and limited availability. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it naturally occurs, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer isolobum plays a more ecological and aesthetic role than a commercial one.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer isolobum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their unique leaf patterns and ornamental value, such as 'Variegatum' and 'Atropurpureum'.</p>
<p>These cultivars often display striking variegation or red autumn coloration, making them desirable in gardens. Hybrids of Acer isolobum are sometimes created to enhance traits like cold hardiness or growth habit, though they are less common than those of other maple species. The plant holds horticultural importance due to its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its use in landscaping and as a specimen tree contributes to its significance in modern horticulture.</p>
