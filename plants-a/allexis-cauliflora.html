<p>Allexis cauliflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian cauliflower tree, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Allexis cauliflora is an important component of the native Hawaiian flora and is adapted to the island's unique ecological conditions.</p>
