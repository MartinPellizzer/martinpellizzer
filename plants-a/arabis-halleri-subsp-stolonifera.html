<p>Arabis halleri subsp.</p>
<p>stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize rocky or alpine soils. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
