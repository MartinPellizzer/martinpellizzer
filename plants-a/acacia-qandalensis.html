                    <h1>Acacia qandalensis</h1>
<p>Acacia qandalensis, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers, which are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators. Acacia qandalensis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>
