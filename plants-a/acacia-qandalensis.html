                        <h1>Acacia qandalensis</h1>
<p>Acacia qandalensis, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers, which are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators. Acacia qandalensis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia qandalensis is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and southern Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This species is commonly associated with coastal dunes and dry forests, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is also found in parts of northern Kenya and adjacent regions of Sudan.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia qandalensis was mainly introduced to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shores of the Gulf. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to avoid becoming invasive in new environments.</p>
