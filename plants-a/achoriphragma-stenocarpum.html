                <h1>Achoriphragma stenocarpum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-seeded acorid, is a member of the Acoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma stenocarpum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma stenocarpum is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos biome, which is known for its rich biodiversity and unique plant species. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is an evergreen shrub that plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma stenocarpum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Control measures are necessary to prevent its further spread.</p>
