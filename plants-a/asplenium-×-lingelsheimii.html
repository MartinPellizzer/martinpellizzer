                    <h1>Asplenium × lingelsheimii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × lingelsheimii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sorangia. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>As a fern, it reproduces through spores rather than seeds, showcasing typical fern reproductive biology.</p>
