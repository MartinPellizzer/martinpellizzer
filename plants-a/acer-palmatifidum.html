<p>Acer palmatifidum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking foliage and graceful form.</p>
