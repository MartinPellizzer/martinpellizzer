                <h1>Acer × perrieri</h1>
<p>Acer × perrieri, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Sapindaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × perrieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × perrieri is a rare hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and primarily restricted to a few isolated locations within its native range. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer × perrieri is considered critically endangered and is listed on the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × perrieri is a unique maple hybrid known for its striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Acer × perrieri involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × perrieri is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × perrieri is a hybrid maple species known for its ornamental value and unique foliage, making it a popular choice in landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its aesthetic appeal contributes to the ornamental plant industry, supporting economic growth in the horticultural sector. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in botanical gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration and urban greening also highlights its importance in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × perrieri has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Cunninghamii', both known for their striking red foliage and compact growth habit. The species has been used in horticultural breeding to develop hybrids that combine the autumn color of maples with improved hardiness. These hybrids are valued for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer × perrieri holds significant horticultural importance in the cultivation of ornamental maples.</p>
