                    <h1>Astragalus depressus var. bonannii</h1>
<p>Astragalus depressus var. bonannii, commonly known as the Bonann's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes.</p>
