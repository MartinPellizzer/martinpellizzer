                <h1>Achyranthes radicans</h1>
<p>Achyranthes radicans, commonly known as spreading knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and erect, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along waterways.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes radicans has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, with a structure consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes radicans is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This plant is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It is commonly found in wetlands and areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes regions with warm climates and abundant rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes radicans was mainly introduced to areas where it has become invasive, particularly in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>It spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is often found in regions with warm climates and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
