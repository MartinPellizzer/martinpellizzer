                <h1>Acisanthera saxatilis</h1>
<p>Acisanthera saxatilis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in crevices and retain moisture.</p>
<p>Acisanthera saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera saxatilis has simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera saxatilis is primarily native to Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the region encompassing the central parts of the country, including the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and parts of Goi√°s. This plant typically grows in rocky and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of the interior regions. It is commonly found in dry forests and shrublands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific area, making it a regionally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera saxatilis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in areas with rocky or degraded land.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, quarries, and construction sites. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming land that was previously unsuitable for vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances.</p>
