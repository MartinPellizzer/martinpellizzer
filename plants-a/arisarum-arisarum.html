                    <h1>Arisarum arisarum</h1>
<p>Arisarum arisarum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a dense, velvety coating.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
