                <h1>Acrostemon stokoei</h1>
<p>Acrostemon stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's torch ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that resemble torches, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Acrostemon stokoei is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon stokoei has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon stokoei is primarily native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland tropical rainforests of the western and central regions of the island. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly observed in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acrostemon stokoei is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon stokoei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Fiji and Tonga.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The plant has adapted well to the tropical climate and has become naturalized in some areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal threat to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains largely confined to the regions where it was first introduced.</p>
