<p>Alsophila parva, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape.</p>
<p>Alsophila parva plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms.</p>
