                    <h1>Arabis serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Arabis serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to rocky, calcareous soils in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found on serpentine substrates, which are rich in heavy metals. Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an example of a metal hyperaccumulator.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
