<p>Actinidia maloides f. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf actinidia, is a unique variant of the actinidia genus native to China.</p>

It is a deciduous vine that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit.</p>
