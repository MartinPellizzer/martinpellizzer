<p>Amygdalus communis var. persicoides, commonly known as the Persian almond.</p>
<p>This variant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by almond-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of amygdalin. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and is closely related to the common almond.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blossoms and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
