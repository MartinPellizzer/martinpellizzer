                <h1>Adelobotrys macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leafed starling tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys macrophyllus is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macrophyllus has large, palmately lobed leaves that are broad, green, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macrophyllus is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The species is known for its large, leathery leaves and is adapted to the rich, moist soils of these areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its preference for the diverse ecosystems present in northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macrophyllus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and construction.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and prefers well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several regions across the southeastern United States, where it has established itself in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes. Its introduction has led to concerns regarding its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
