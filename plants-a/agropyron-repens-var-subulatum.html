                    <h1>Agropyron repens var. subulatum</h1>
<p>Agropyron repens var. subulatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in disturbed soils and rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to colonize bare ground quickly.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is a valuable forage plant for livestock in certain regions.</p>
