<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea leptophylloides is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of western and central Europe, where it has been introduced to various habitats. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare plant and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea leptophylloides is a low-growing perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, fluffy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
