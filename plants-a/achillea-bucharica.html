                <h1>Achillea bucharica</h1>
<p>Achillea bucharica, commonly known as the Caucasian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea bucharica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette formation and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a grayish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding dark purple disk florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental species. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited cultivation, it is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and dying back in winter, with new growth emerging in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stems to encourage reblooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea bucharica plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining healthy soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica is a perennial plant native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and diverse applications.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture for its attractive, fragrant flowers, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscaping. In traditional medicine, it has been utilized for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have limited use in herbal teas or infusions.</p>
