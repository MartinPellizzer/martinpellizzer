                <h1>Achillea bucharica</h1>
<p>Achillea bucharica, commonly known as the Caucasian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring finely divided, silver-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica has narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, composite heads consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and parts of southern Russia.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also found in some regions of Turkey and northern Iraq, though its distribution is limited. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from land-use changes, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of Near Threatened.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bucharica is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea bucharica involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its beauty and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
