                    <h1>Asplenium cimmeriorum</h1>
<p>Asplenium cimmeriorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments such as crevices in cliffs or on walls. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually dark green and velvety to the touch. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread and establish in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Asplenium cimmeriorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
