                    <h1>Atriplex argentea var. hillmanii</h1>
<p>Atriplex argentea var. hillmanii, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
