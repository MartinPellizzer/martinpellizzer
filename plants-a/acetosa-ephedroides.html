                        <h1>Acetosa ephedroides</h1>
<p>Acetosa ephedroides, commonly known as the Chinese wild licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing small, brown seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its alkaloid content, which has traditional uses in Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
