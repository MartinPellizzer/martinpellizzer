<p>Afrosersalisia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plants typically produce small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often arranged in racemes. Afrosersalisia species are valued for their durable, aromatic wood, which has been used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction.</p>
