                <h1>Aegopodium nadeshdae</h1>
<p>Aegopodium nadeshdae, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium nadeshdae has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
