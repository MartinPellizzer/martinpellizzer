<p>Anubias, commonly known as African waterweed, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that help it thrive in moist or submerged environments. The plant is often used in aquariums due to its hardiness and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Anubias species typically have rhizomes that anchor them to substrates, and they produce small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>
