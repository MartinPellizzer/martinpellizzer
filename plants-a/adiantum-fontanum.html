                <h1>Adiantum fontanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum fontanum, commonly known as the Fountain Maidenhair Fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum fontanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fontanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that anchors the plant and absorbs nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fontanum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and along streams. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. It is also known to occur in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fontanum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is now considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies contribute to its spread and ecological impact.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and mitigate its effects on local ecosystems.</p>
