                <h1>Achillea purpurea</h1>
<p>Achillea purpurea, commonly known as purple yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea purpurea has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a bluish-gray color, a lanceolate shape, and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to grayish color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by purple ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, with small, wind-dispersed seeds that are released from the dried flower heads.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea purpurea is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is known for its showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most prevalent in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea purpurea was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and landscape gardening efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open areas across the western United States. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, often thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its ability to spread via seeds and rhizomes has contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in most areas where it is established.</p>
