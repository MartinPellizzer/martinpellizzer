<p>Ariocarpus disciformis subsp.</p>
<p>jarmilae, commonly known as the "humpback cactus," is a small, barrel-shaped cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It features a ribbed, rounded stem that is typically greenish-gray with white spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to arid environments.</p>
