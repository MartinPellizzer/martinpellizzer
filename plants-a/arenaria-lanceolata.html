                    <h1>Arenaria lanceolata</h1>
<p>Arenaria lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria lanceolata is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are cold and conditions are extreme.</p>
