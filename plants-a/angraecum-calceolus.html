                    <h1>Angraecum calceolus</h1>
<p>Angraecum calceolus, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a unique inflorescence with a single, waxy, white flower that resembles a star, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
