<p>Asplenium × javorkae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>eglii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a rare fern species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it exhibits a unique morphology due to its hybrid origin.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is of interest to botanists for its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability.</p>
