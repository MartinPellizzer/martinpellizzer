                <h1>Acorus rumphianus</h1>
<p>Acorus rumphianus, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually sword-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spadices. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure.</p>
<p>Acorus rumphianus is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus rumphianus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a bright green color and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that is often slightly fibrous in texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a spathe, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous roots are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus rumphianus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and abundant moisture. It is particularly common in the lowland areas of Indonesia, especially in the islands of Sumatra and Java.</p>
<p>Acorus rumphianus is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus rumphianus was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its presence can indicate the health of wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local biodiversity.</p>
