                        <h1>Abronia maritima subsp. capensis</h1>
<p>Abronia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>capensis, commonly known as the Cape sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abronia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>capensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often spore-producing reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often found in diverse habitats around the world. Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many familiar families such as the cacti and the amaranths, often characterized by their distinctive floral structures. Its family is Nyctaginaceae, commonly known as the four-o'clock family, which includes plants with showy, often brightly colored flowers that open in the late afternoon. Its genus is Abronia, a group of flowering plants native to southern Africa, typically characterized by their small, showy flowers and succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Abronia maritima, a specific type within the genus Abronia, known for its adaptations to coastal environments and its distinctive floral morphology.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
