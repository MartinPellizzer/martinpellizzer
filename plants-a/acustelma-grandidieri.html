                <h1>Acustelma grandidieri</h1>
<p>Acustelma grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star-of-Bahia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acustelma grandidieri is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the flora of Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acustelma grandidieri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, bushy structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from November to January, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acustelma grandidieri is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the regions of Antsiranana and the northeastern coastal areas. This plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the unique climate and ecological conditions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acustelma grandidieri was mainly introduced to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the southern and eastern regions of the island. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments with sandy soils. It has been observed in areas near the town of Tulear.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
