<p>Alexa, commonly known as *Alexa* (though not a plant), is not a botanical species and therefore does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It is a brand name associated with Amazon's voice assistant. If you meant a different plant, please provide the correct name. For now, no botanical information can be provided.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
