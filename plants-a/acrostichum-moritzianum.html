<p>Acrostichum moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
