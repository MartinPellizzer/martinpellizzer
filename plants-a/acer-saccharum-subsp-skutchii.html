<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's sugar maple, is a subspecies native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology, including coarsely serrated margins and a more elongated shape compared to the typical sugar maple.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
