                <h1>Adenoncos sumatrana</h1>
<p>Adenoncos sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran adenoncos, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos sumatrana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, tropical soil conditions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos sumatrana is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, Sumatera, and Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested environments. Adenoncos sumatrana is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos sumatrana was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it common in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native species. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
