                <h1>Aconitum atlanticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are palmately lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty rather than for consumption.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum atlanticum has leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in dense racemes, and feature spurred petals, blooming in late summer to early fall, pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle containing small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum atlanticum is primarily native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States, particularly in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along the Atlantic coast, often in areas with partial to full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it can tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. It is an important part of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum atlanticum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has been established in several regions, including parts of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
