                <h1>Acer paihengii</h1>
<p>Acer paihengii, commonly known as the Hengshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are palmately lobed with five to seven pointed lobes, and they turn vibrant colors in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer paihengii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color during the growing season, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a slow-growing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming in early spring, and is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer paihengii is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, with populations restricted to specific microhabitats. This species thrives in temperate forests with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, Acer paihengii is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer paihengii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-ripe cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This slow-growing tree thrives in USDA hardiness zones 6-8, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and should be watered regularly during the growing season, though it is relatively drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer paihengii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer paihengii contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer paihengii is a rare tree species native to China, primarily known for its ornamental value and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree's unique appearance makes it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts, contributing to both industrial and economic interests in horticulture. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in local communities, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and conservation status, its applications remain largely restricted to ecological and scientific research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer paihengii has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Cunninghamii', which are known for their striking foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It is also a parent in various hybrids that combine its distinctive features with those of other maple species, such as Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn coloration, making them popular choices for gardeners. The horticultural importance of Acer paihengii lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at developing new, hardier maple varieties.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics contribute to the diversity and aesthetic appeal of cultivated maples in both residential and public landscapes.</p>
