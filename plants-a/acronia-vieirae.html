                <h1>Acronia vieirae</h1>
<p>Acronia vieirae, commonly known as the Vieira's acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acronia vieirae is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia vieirae has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, bloom in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia vieirae is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, specifically the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic Forest biome. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with moderate rainfall. It is often associated with dunes and rocky outcrops near the coastline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia vieirae was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along the Atlantic coast. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as dunes and coastal vegetation. Its introduction is believed to be due to natural seed dispersal by wind or water.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
