                    <h1>Actipsis</h1>
<p>Actipsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Actipsis is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
