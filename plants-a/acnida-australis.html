                <h1>Acnida australis</h1>
<p>Acnida australis, commonly known as the Australian acacia, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and ecological significance make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida australis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a rough, greyish bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida australis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and western parts of the country, including the coastal regions and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Acnida australis is commonly seen in naturalized habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida australis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of early European settlement and has since become naturalized in several regions. The plant thrives in coastal environments and has spread along the west coast of the North Island. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has established itself in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
