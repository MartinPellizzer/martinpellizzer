<p>Alnus alnobetula subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northeastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges, riverbanks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
