                <h1>Achroanthes floridana</h1>
<p>Achroanthes floridana, commonly known as the Florida ghostflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the family Ericaceae, characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and elliptical, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes floridana has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes floridana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and southern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near freshwater wetlands and along the edges of swamps. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as ditches, roadsides, and drainage areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes floridana was mainly introduced to Florida, USA, as part of botanical research and horticultural studies.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils near freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant is known for its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
