                <h1>Achyrophorus brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and long, slender leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that resembles a starfruit in appearance. The plant is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus brasiliensis has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elongated leaflets arranged along a central axis, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a white or pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus brasiliensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the humid, tropical regions of the country, particularly in states such as São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the dense understory of the forest canopy. The species is adapted to the high humidity and nutrient-rich soils of this region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus brasiliensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, where it has become an invasive species. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
