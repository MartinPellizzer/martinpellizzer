<p>Amorphophallus gregoryanus, commonly known as the Gregory's elephant's foot, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, thickened underground tuber, which resembles the trunk of an elephant, and its ability to store water and nutrients efficiently. The plant produces a single, large, white or pinkish flower that blooms at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it can take several years to reach maturity, making it a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in the wild.</p>
