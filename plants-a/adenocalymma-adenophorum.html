                <h1>Adenocalymma adenophorum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma adenophorum, commonly known as the slender leaf adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma adenophorum is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma adenophorum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and bloom during the spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma adenophorum is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma adenophorum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and transportation corridors.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many disturbed environments.</p>
