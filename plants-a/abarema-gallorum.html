                        <h1>Abarema gallorum</h1>
<p>Abarema gallorum, commonly known as the gall antplant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to form galls on the stems of certain plants, which provide shelter for ant colonies. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a cluster.</p>
<p>The plant's relationship with ants is symbiotic, as the ants protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema gallorum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southeastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema gallorum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in South America, particularly in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land clearing and agriculture.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
