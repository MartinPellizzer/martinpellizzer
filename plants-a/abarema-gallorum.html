                        <h1>Abarema gallorum</h1>
<p>Abarema gallorum, commonly known as the gall antplant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to form galls on the stems of certain plants, which provide shelter for ant colonies. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a cluster.</p>
<p>The plant's relationship with ants is symbiotic, as the ants protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food.</p>
