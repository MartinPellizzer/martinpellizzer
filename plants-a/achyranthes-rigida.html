                <h1>Achyranthes rigida</h1>
<p>Achyranthes rigida, commonly known as rigid knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. The plant features upright, branched stems that are covered in stiff, rigid hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rigida has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rigida is primarily native to North America, particularly the central and eastern regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and open woods. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in the southern states. It is also present in parts of Canada, including Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into the western United States, including states like Texas and Arizona.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rigida was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both native and non-native environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
