                <h1>Adinandra macquilingensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra macquilingensis, commonly known as the Macquiling's adinandra, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and smooth, dark green leaves. It typically grows in lowland dipterocarp forests and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra macquilingensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 12 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly pubescent underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, compact growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macquilingensis is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of Luzon, particularly in the provinces of Benguet and Ifugao. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters. The plant is often associated with secondary growth areas and is commonly found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra macquilingensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland rainforests of Luzon, particularly in the provinces of Bataan and Quezon. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized and is not widely spread beyond its native range.</p>
