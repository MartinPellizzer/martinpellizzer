                <h1>Achillea graya</h1>
<p>Achillea graya, commonly known as gray yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Gray yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea graya has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are generally gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, composite, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, with white to pale yellow petals blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea graya is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Australia, where it is cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in dry, open environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited native range and potential for invasive behavior in non-native areas have led to some conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea graya is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late fall. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea graya is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea graya contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea graya is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically valued for its medicinal properties, including its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it is primarily cultivated for horticultural purposes, contributing to the ornamental plant trade. Culturally, it has symbolic associations with love and protection, often featured in traditional folklore and poetry.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity by providing habitat and food for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea graya has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Silver King,' which are known for their striking foliage and extended flowering periods. Hybrids of Achillea graya often combine traits from related species, such as improved cold hardiness and longer bloom seasons. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in a range of conditions and their contribution to garden aesthetics.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping and as cut flowers further highlights their horticultural significance.</p>
