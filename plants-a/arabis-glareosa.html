<p>Arabis glareosa, commonly known as the glaucous rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a powdery blue or grey coating, known as a glaucous bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Arabis glareosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
