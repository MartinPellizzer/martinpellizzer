<p>Acalypha filiformis var. urophylloides, commonly known as the silky hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silky-textured leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a trailing or shrub-like form depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are elongated and narrow, often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha filiformis var. urophylloides has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in compact clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha filiformis var. urophylloides is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the Indonesian archipelago. It thrives in humid, lowland environments such as rainforests and swampy areas, typically found at altitudes below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts underway to protect its remaining wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha filiformis var. urophylloides is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, feather-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests naturally.</p>
