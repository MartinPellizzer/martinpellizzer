<p>Austroblechnum doodioides, commonly known as the Doodioides holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Austroblechnum doodioides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
