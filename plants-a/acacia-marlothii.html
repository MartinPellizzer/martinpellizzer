<p>Acacia marlothii, commonly known as the marloth's acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>The plant also plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia marlothii is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Karoo and Succulent Karoo biomes. This plant is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and along riverbanks in these areas. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil environments.</p>
<p>Acacia marlothii plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia marlothii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State. This species is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has led to its spread along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
