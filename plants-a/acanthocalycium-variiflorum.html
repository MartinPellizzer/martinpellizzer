                        <h1>Acanthocalycium variiflorum</h1>
<p>Acanthocalycium variiflorum, commonly known as the variable-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Acanthocalycium variiflorum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocalycium variiflorum is primarily native to northern and central Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, and Zacatecas.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils and among limestone formations. This cactus thrives in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. It is commonly found in scrublands and grasslands at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocalycium variiflorum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern states.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with arid or semi-arid climates, such as Texas and California. This cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it has been noted to spread aggressively in some regions, raising concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
