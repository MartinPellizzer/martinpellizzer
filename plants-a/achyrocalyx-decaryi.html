                <h1>Achyrocalyx decaryi</h1>
<p>Achyrocalyx decaryi, commonly known as the Congo hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often found in the understory of rainforests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx decaryi has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that becomes darker with age, growing in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx decaryi is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forests. It is commonly observed in the Amazon Basin and other regions with high biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx decaryi was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world as a horticultural plant.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
