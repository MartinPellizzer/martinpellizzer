<p>Ajuga grossidentata, commonly known as carpet bugle or broad-leaf bugle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often adorned with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a valuable groundcover in ecological restoration projects.</p>
