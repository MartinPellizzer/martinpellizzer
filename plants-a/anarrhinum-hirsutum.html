                    <h1>Anarrhinum hirsutum</h1>
<p>Anarrhinum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves and stems help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Anarrhinum hirsutum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
