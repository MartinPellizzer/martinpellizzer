<p>Atriplex congolensis, commonly known as Congo saltbush, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex congolensis is adapted to arid and saline soils, making it a hardy species in challenging environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals.</p>
