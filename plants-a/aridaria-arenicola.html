<p>Aridaria arenicola, commonly known as the sand flat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in regions with low precipitation. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale yellow, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Aridaria arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
