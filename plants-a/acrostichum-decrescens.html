                <h1>Acrostichum decrescens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum decrescens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decrescens has large, elongated leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming during the spring and summer months, and is primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed, spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores by wind, and the roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decrescens is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It prefers rich, organic soils and is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in both natural and anthropogenic wetlands across its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum decrescens was mainly introduced to wetlands and disturbed areas along the eastern coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, tidal flats, and along the edges of freshwater swamps. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it a common invader in coastal regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its success in new habitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
