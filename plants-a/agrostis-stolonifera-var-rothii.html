                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. rothii</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. rothii, commonly known as the Roth's bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form dense, uniform turf. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, along streambanks, and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes used in specialty turfgrass applications.</p>
