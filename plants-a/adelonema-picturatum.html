                <h1>Adelonema picturatum</h1>
<p>Adelonema picturatum, commonly known as the painted bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well.</p>
<p>Adelonema picturatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema picturatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema picturatum is primarily native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panam√°, Peru, and Suriname.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is commonly found in lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Neotropical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema picturatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and agriculture.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soil, making it a common invader in disturbed ecosystems. This plant has been reported in several regions across the United States, particularly in the southeastern and western states. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce through both seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is still limited compared to other more widespread invasive species.</p>
