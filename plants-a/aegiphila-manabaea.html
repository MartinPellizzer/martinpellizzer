                <h1>Aegiphila manabaea</h1>
<p>Aegiphila manabaea, commonly known as the Manabean ironwood, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, small opposite leaves, and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila manabaea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas and a yellowish color, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>
