                    <h1>Angianthus phyllocalymmeus</h1>
<p>Angianthus phyllocalymmeus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Angianthus phyllocalymmeus plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for native pollinators.</p>
