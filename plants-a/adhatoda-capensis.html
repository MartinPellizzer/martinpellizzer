                <h1>Adhatoda capensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda capensis, commonly known as the African Trumpet or Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Adhatoda capensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda capensis has ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are tubular with five lobes, typically violet to purple in color, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda capensis is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of eastern and central Africa as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda capensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadside areas. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in parts of its range.</p>
