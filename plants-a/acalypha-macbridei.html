<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha macbridei has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length; they are usually bright green with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and often slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale green to white petals and stamen, blooming during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a thin, papery covering.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macbridei is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered critically endangered in the wild. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acalypha macbridei faces significant threats and is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha macbridei is a tropical plant known for its vibrant, colorful foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with stem cuttings being the most reliable and efficient method. This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions, entering a dormant phase during cooler months, though it can be grown year-round in suitable climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions, with fertilization during the growing season to promote healthy growth. Pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and create a lush, colorful display.</p>
