                <h1>Adenophyllum coccineum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically borne on tall, sturdy stems that rise above the foliage.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum coccineum is adapted to moist, woodland habitats and is often found in rich, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum coccineum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with a bright red color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum coccineum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with coastal ranges and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum coccineum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum coccineum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking red flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to the northern and central parts of New Zealand.</p>
