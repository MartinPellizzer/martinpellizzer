<p>Amaracarpus braunianus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
