<p>Adelaida borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon adenium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments.

Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adelaida borbonica is considered threatened in the wild.</p>
