                <h1>Adelaida borbonica</h1>
<p>Adelaida borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon adenium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adelaida borbonica is considered threatened in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelaida borbonica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelaida borbonica is primarily native to Réunion.</p>
<p>This plant is endemic to the island of Réunion, which is located in the Indian Ocean. It thrives in the tropical climate and diverse ecosystems of the island. Adelaida borbonica is typically found in coastal areas and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to Réunion, making it a unique part of the island's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelaida borbonica was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the wild in 1998 on the island of Oahu. The plant is believed to have been introduced through accidental transport via shipping or cargo. It has since spread to other islands in the Hawaiian archipelago.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, it is considered an invasive species.</p>
