                        <h1>Acantholimon glutinosum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon glutinosum, commonly known as sticky stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a sticky, waxy substance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon glutinosum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flowers and often show adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in arid and coastal regions, known for their medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and coastal areas, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon glutinosum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its sticky leaves and preference for sandy soils in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon glutinosum is primarily native to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is often seen in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon glutinosum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where water is scarce and temperatures can be extreme. This plant is typically found in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure. It has adapted to these harsh conditions through its deep root system and succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in non-native habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
