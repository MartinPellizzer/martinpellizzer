                    <h1>Auliza nocturna</h1>
<p>Auliza nocturna, commonly known as the nightshade orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark purple petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance during the evening hours. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture maximum sunlight in the dense forest understory.</p>
<p>Auliza nocturna is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations and limited natural habitat.</p>
