                <h1>Aechmea hellae</h1>
<p>Aechmea hellae, commonly known as the Hell's Aechmea, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking floral bracts that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Aechmea hellae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea hellae has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thickened base with a fibrous, spongy texture that resembles bark. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of red or orange, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
