                <h1>Adiantum sulphureum</h1>
<p>Adiantum sulphureum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking golden hue, particularly along the margins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum sulphureum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum sulphureum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem, and typically measure about 20â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a striking golden-yellow to orange color, especially when dried, and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is green and covered in a fine, hairy texture, growing from a rhizome. It does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and its reproductive structures are microscopic spores released from the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the moist, shaded environments where it thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sulphureum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and rock crevices. This species is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing in montane and lowland rainforests. Its natural range extends to parts of India and Malaysia as well.</p>
<p>Adiantum sulphureum is well adapted to high humidity and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sulphureum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a fern species native to South America, specifically Brazil. The introduction of this plant to New Zealand is believed to have occurred through horticultural trade. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the country.</p>
