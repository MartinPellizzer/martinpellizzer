                    <h1>Aspidium pentangularum</h1>
<p>Aspidium pentangularum, commonly known as the five-angled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive five-angled appearance in its pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Aspidium pentangularum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions.</p>
