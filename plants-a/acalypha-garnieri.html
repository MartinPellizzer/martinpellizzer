                        <h1>Acalypha garnieri</h1>
<p>Acalypha garnieri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky fanflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acalypha garnieri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha garnieri is primarily native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland rainforests and moist mountainous regions of the western and central parts of the island. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha garnieri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various coastal and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in lowland regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
