                        <h1>Acacia cycnorum var. minutifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia cycnorum var. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved white acacia, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, pinnate leaves composed of numerous fine, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>
