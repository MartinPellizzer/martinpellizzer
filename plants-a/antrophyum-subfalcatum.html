                    <h1>Antrophyum subfalcatum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a unique species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
