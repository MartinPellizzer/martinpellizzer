<p>Asplenium rhizophyllum f. tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima spleenwort, is a fern species native to the humid forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the leaves. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its rhizomes that extend into the substrate for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution in the Andean region.</p>
