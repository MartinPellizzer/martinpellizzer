                <h1>Adenia acuta</h1>
<p>Adenia acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved adenia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia acuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia acuta has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnate with lanceolate leaflets, dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies, blooming primarily during the wet season. The fruit is a smooth, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia acuta is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern parts of the island, where the climate is tropical and humid. This plant typically grows in dense forests and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is an important species in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Adenia acuta is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia acuta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its aesthetic value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant's spread is often limited by its preference for specific soil conditions and microhabitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native flora.</p>
