                <h1>Actinochloa tenuis</h1>
<p>Actinochloa tenuis, commonly known as the slender threadgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Actinochloa tenuis is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinochloa tenuis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are spike-like, with pale green to white florets that bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinochloa tenuis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This species is also present in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea. It is often associated with freshwater habitats and can be found in marshes, riverbanks, and flooded forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinochloa tenuis was mainly introduced to agricultural and disturbed areas for its potential as a forage crop.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, roadsides, and fields where soil conditions are moist to moderately dry. This plant has been reported in several regions of the Americas, including the United States, Mexico, and parts of South America. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a successful invader in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains understudied in many areas.</p>
