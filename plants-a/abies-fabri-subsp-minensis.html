<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>minensis, commonly known as the Min Mountains fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of the fir genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its cones are small and typically hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
