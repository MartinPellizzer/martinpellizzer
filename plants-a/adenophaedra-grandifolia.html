                <h1>Adenophaedra grandifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophaedra grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved adenophaedra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Adenophaedra grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra grandifolia has elliptical, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra grandifolia is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panam√°, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of forests. The plant is well-adapted to the warm and moist climates of the Neotropical region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra grandifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which allows it to spread rapidly in forested areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
