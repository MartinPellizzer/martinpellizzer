                <h1>Aegiceras fragrans</h1>
<p>Aegiceras fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests along tidal mudflats. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Aegiceras fragrans plays an important ecological role in supporting marine and terrestrial biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras fragrans has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in moist soil.</p>
