                    <h1>Arenaria cikaea</h1>
<p>Arenaria cikaea, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria cikaea is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
