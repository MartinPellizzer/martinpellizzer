                        <h1>Abutilon theophrasti</h1>
<p>Abutilon theophrasti, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in many regions.</p>
<p>The plant has also been studied for its potential use in biofuel production due to its high biomass yield.</p>
