                    <h1>Acacia praelongata</h1>
<p>Acacia praelongata, commonly known as the longpod acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. Acacia praelongata is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
