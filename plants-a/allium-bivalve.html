<p>Allium bivalve, commonly known as the two-valved leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and bulbous stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
