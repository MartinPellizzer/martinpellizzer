                <h1>Adike glaberrima</h1>
<p>Adike glaberrima, commonly known as the African wild spinach, is a leafy vegetable native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant is perennial and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in riverine areas and swampy regions. Its leaves are edible, rich in nutrients, and widely used in traditional cuisines across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The plant also has cultural significance and is sometimes used in local herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adike glaberrima has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adike glaberrima is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in lowland areas and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adike glaberrima was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have led to its spread in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature and impact on native vegetation.</p>
