<p>Chinese hollyhock, scientifically known as Alcea rosea subsp. ficifolia, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to China. It is celebrated for its vibrant, showy blooms that range from pink to red and white, making it a popular choice in gardens and floral arrangements. This subspecies differs from the common hollyhock in its broader leaves and more compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring moderate care to flourish. With its historical and ornamental significance, it remains a cherished addition to horticultural collections worldwide.</p>
