<p>Alnus rugosa f. tomophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, mid-green leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and soil stabilization.</p>
