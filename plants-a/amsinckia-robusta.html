<p>Amsinckia robusta, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Amsinckia robusta is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a resilient species well-suited to harsh desert conditions.</p>
