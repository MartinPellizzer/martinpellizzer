                    <h1>Anisopappus lejolyanus</h1>
<p>Anisopappus lejolyanus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
