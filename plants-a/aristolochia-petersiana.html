<p>Aristolochia petersiana, commonly known as Peters' Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal use, it is cultivated in some regions, though it is also considered an invasive species in others.</p>
