                <h1>Adriana quadripartita</h1>
<p>Adriana quadripartita, commonly known as the four-parted adriana, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its quadrifoliate leaves, which are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adriana quadripartita has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub with a bushy growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana quadripartita is primarily native to South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in various regions across these three states, often in dry and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and rocky outcrops. The distribution of Adriana quadripartita reflects its adaptation to the diverse climatic conditions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana quadripartita was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, four-parted leaves. The distribution includes parts of Europe, North America, and some regions in Asia where it has been cultivated. However, it has not established itself as an invasive species in most of these regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been limited to botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
