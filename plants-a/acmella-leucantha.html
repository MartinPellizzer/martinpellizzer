                <h1>Acmella leucantha</h1>
<p>Acmella leucantha, commonly known as the white spurge or white puffball, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, spherical seed pods that resemble small puffballs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella leucantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking seed pods and resilience in various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive white center, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid lowland areas. This species thrives in moist environments like rainforests and swampy areas, often near water bodies. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is listed as near threatened by some organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha is a vibrant, flowering plant known for its striking yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acmella leucantha includes a period of rapid growth followed by blooming, typically in warm seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushiness are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its small yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in traditional medicine to treat skin conditions and as a natural remedy for inflammation and pain. The plant also has potential applications in the cosmetic industry due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. In some cultures, it holds symbolic value and is used in rituals or as a decorative element.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic uses are still being explored, and further research is needed to fully understand its potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
