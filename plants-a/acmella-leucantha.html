                <h1>Acmella leucantha</h1>
<p>Acmella leucantha, commonly known as the white buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The flowers produce tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a prominent white center, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to stabilize the plant in its environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the western and central areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest ecosystems. It is commonly associated with wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats in Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella leucantha was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers and is often used in ornamental gardening. It has been reported as an invasive species in some parts of the world, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it requires careful management to prevent its spread.</p>
