                        <h1>Acalypha salvadorensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran spurge, is a flowering plant native to El Salvador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of fern allies and includes plants like horsetails that have a unique vascular system. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as magnolias and laurels.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive floral structures and often used in traditional medicine. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with latex and often has unique floral and fruit structures. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupids," characterized by their showy, often colorful bracts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha salvadorensis, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha that is native to El Salvador and is known for its distinctive foliage and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis is primarily native to El Salvador and the southwest region of Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of El Salvador.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of a regional botanical survey and ornamental plant introduction program. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and has since become established in several wetland and riparian habitats. It is now considered a non-native species that has spread beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
