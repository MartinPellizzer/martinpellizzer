<p>Acalypha salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran beauty or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its structure is often bushy or shrub-like. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, displaying a bright green color with a slightly reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark, and it grows in a spreading or upright pattern depending on environmental conditions. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis is a species native to El Salvador, specifically found in the central and western regions of the country.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also present in parts of Honduras and Nicaragua, indicating a slight expansion beyond its original range. This plant thrives in tropical dry forests and scrublands, often growing in well-drained soils. It is typically found at elevations between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha salvadorensis is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick root development. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
