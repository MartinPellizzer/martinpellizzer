<p>Aethionema cristatum var. spinulosum, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are often surrounded by a dense ring of bracts. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its spiny, glandular leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss.</p>
