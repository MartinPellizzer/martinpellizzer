                    <h1>Artemisia longifolia</h1>
<p>Artemisia longifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called achenes. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which give it a strong, bitter scent and contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal uses.</p>
<p>Artemisia longifolia thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
