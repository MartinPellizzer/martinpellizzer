<p>Artemisia deserti, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Artemisia deserti is adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
