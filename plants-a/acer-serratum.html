<p>Acer serratum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer serratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and autumn color.</p>
