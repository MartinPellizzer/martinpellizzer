<p>Asarca campestris, commonly known as field garlic, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has a strong, garlic-like odor due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds.</p>
