                        <h1>Acer creticum var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Acer creticum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically round or heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
