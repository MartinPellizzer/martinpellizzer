                    <h1>Asplenium udzungwense</h1>
<p>Asplenium udzungwense, commonly known as the Udzungwa spleenwort, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices within montane forests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Asplenium udzungwense is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited population size.</p>
