<p>Arthrophytum persicum, commonly known as the Persian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Persia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive with minimal water make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Arthrophytum persicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
