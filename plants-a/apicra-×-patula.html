                    <h1>Apicra × patula</h1>
<p>Apicra × patula, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Apicra* and *patula* species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces a distinctive hollow stem and a milky sap, which is a common feature among dandelion species. Its leaves are usually basal, with a lobed or serrated margin, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or open fields.</p>
<p>Apicra × patula is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
