                            <h1>Agrostis Alba Subsp. Maritima</h1>
<p>Saltgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba subsp. maritima, is a resilient plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is commonly found along sandy shores and salt marshes where it withstands harsh conditions like high salinity and strong winds. This low-growing grass has fine, silver-green blades that reflect sunlight and help reduce water loss. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems. Despite its humble appearance, saltgrass plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining habitat diversity.</p>
