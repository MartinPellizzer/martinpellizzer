                    <h1>Acacia recurvata</h1>
<p>Acacia recurvata, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and phyllodes that are typically narrow and curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which appear in spring and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia recurvata is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and fire.</p>
