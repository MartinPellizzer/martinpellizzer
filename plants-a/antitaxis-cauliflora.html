                    <h1>Antitaxis cauliflora</h1>
<p>Antitaxis cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly from the stem rather than from the branches. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Antitaxis cauliflora is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests.</p>
