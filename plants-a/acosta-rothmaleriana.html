                <h1>Acosta rothmaleriana</h1>
<p>Acosta rothmaleriana, commonly known as the Rothmaler's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes, often in the Andes mountains. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and branched.</p>
<p>Acosta rothmaleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta rothmaleriana has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, measuring up to 10 cm in length and exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rothmaleriana is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and humid montane environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. Its native distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>
<p>It is not found outside of this geographic range in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rothmaleriana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and warm temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in southern regions of the United States, parts of South America, and Southeast Asia. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and ability to withstand mild drought conditions. Its introduction has expanded its natural range beyond its native habitat, contributing to its popularity among horticulturists.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
