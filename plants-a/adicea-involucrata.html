                <h1>Adicea involucrata</h1>
<p>Adicea involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Adicea involucrata is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea involucrata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plantâ€™s growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea involucrata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open grasslands, woodlands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Adicea involucrata is also occasionally reported in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea involucrata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions. The plant has spread beyond its native range due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. It is often considered an invasive species in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
