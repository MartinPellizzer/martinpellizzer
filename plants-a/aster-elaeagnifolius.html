                    <h1>Aster elaeagnifolius</h1>
<p>Aster elaeagnifolius, commonly known as silverleaf aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed habitats.</p>
