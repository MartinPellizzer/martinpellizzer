                    <h1>Aloe laeta var. laeta</h1>
<p>Aloe laeta var. laeta, commonly known as the silver aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
