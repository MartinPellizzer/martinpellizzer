                <h1>Acrostichum ovalifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ovalifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features large, heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a rough texture. Its flowers are showy, with five petals and a prominent yellow stamen, often blooming in summer.</p>
<p>Acrostichum ovalifolium is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovalifolium has elongated, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green color, growing upright and branching freely. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are released when the fruit dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovalifolium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other wetland habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments with high salinity, making it well-adapted to brackish water conditions. Its natural range extends from southern Florida through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is often associated with estuaries and tidal zones where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovalifolium was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water areas along the eastern and southern coasts of the United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, saline environments and is commonly found in marshes, estuaries, and salt meadows. This plant has become an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its introduction has also led to changes in the structure and function of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
