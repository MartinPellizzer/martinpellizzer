<p>Adiantum philippianum, commonly known as the Philippine maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum philippianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum philippianum has frond-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
