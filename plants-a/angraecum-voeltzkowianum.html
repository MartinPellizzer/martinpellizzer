                    <h1>Angraecum voeltzkowianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum voeltzkowianum, commonly known as the Voeltzkow's orchid, is a species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white flowers with long, slender petals and a prominent, spurred lip. It blooms during the dry season, typically in the late afternoon, and relies on specific pollinators like the hawkmoth.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
