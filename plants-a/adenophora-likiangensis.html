                <h1>Adenophora likiangensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high elevations. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well.</p>
<p>Adenophora likiangensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora likiangensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 6 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora likiangensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, typically at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in the eastern and southern parts of Yunnan, particularly in areas with cool and moist climates. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including strong sunlight and poor soil.</p>
<p>Adenophora likiangensis is an important component of the alpine flora in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora likiangensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
