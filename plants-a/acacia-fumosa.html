                        <h1>Acacia fumosa</h1>
<p>Acacia fumosa, commonly known as the smoke bush or ghost acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its unique, feathery foliage that resembles smoke. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are pollinated by insects. Acacia fumosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.</p>
