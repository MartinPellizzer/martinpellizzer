                        <h1>Acacia fumosa</h1>
<p>Acacia fumosa, commonly known as the smoke bush or ghost acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its unique, feathery foliage that resembles smoke. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are pollinated by insects. Acacia fumosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia fumosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in shrubland and savanna ecosystems. This plant thrives in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia fumosa is also known for its distinctive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia fumosa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize soil. It also serves as a source of food for wildlife and can be used in landscaping for its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns in non-native regions.</p>
