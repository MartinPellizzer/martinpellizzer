                    <h1>Ammocharis</h1>
<p>Ammocharis, commonly known as the African lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Ammocharis species typically grow from corms, which are underground storage organs that allow them to survive dry periods. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Ammocharis citriodora, which is prized for its ornamental value and unique scent.</p>
