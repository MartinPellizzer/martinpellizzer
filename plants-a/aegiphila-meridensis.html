                <h1>Aegiphila meridensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila meridensis, commonly known as the Desert Sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Aegiphila meridensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila meridensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>
