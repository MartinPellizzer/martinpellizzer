<p>Amyema artensis, commonly known as the Articulated Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble a fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Amyema artensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
