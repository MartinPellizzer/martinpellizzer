                    <h1>Asplenium attenuatum var. integrum</h1>
<p>Asplenium attenuatum var. integrum, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, contributing to its role in the ecosystem's spore dispersal.</p>
