                    <h1>Anathallis haberi</h1>
<p>Anathallis haberi, commonly known as the Haber's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Anathallis haberi is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, fibrous stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
