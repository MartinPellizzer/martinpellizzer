<p>Abutilon mendocinum, commonly known as the Mendo cottonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon mendocinum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are yellow to orange in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon mendocinum is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Sierra Nevada foothills. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats, often growing in open woodlands or along stream banks. This species is typically found at elevations between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Abutilon mendocinum is considered threatened and is listed as a species of concern in several states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
