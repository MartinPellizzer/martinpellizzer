                <h1>Acmena kingii</h1>
<p>Acmena kingii, commonly known as the red-leafed acmena, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena kingii has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena kingii is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often growing in the understorey of moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically in coastal or inland rainforest regions. It is known for its attractive, glossy leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally found in nearby islands such as Lord Howe Island.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena kingii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is often used as a shrub or small tree in residential and commercial landscapes. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study.</p>
