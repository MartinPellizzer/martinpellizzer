                <h1>Acidocroton litoralis</h1>
<p>Acidocroton litoralis, commonly known as the sea croton, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it is adapted to salt spray and high humidity. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually simple and alternate. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a resilient choice for coastal landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton litoralis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming from December to February, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to coastal environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton litoralis is primarily native to Haiti.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in areas with sandy or limestone soils. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open, sun-exposed habitats. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution is largely due to its specific ecological requirements and the restricted geographic range of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton litoralis was mainly introduced to coastal areas of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky shorelines where it can tolerate salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. This plant is often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline and preventing erosion. Its introduction has been both intentional and unintentional, often through human activities such as coastal development and shipping.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in these regions.</p>
