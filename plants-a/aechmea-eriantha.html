                <h1>Aechmea eriantha</h1>
<p>Aechmea eriantha, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is dense and covered in a thick, velvety layer of trichomes, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Aechmea eriantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea eriantha has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and dark green, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 30â€“50 cm long and have a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The plant has a short, stout stem with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows upright from the base. It produces compact, spadix-like inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
