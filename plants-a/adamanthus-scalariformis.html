                <h1>Adamanthus scalariformis</h1>
<p>Adamanthus scalariformis, commonly known as the scalloped sycamore, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the scalloped edges of its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Adamanthus scalariformis is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus scalariformis has palmate leaves that are typically 15â€“30 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus scalariformis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern South America.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions spanning from northeastern Brazil through parts of Paraguay and northern Argentina. It typically grows in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soils. Adamanthus scalariformis is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus scalariformis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil types. However, it has since spread beyond its original introduction range, becoming naturalized in wetland and swampy areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, its invasive tendencies have led to increased management efforts in some regions.</p>
