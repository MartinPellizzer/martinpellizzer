<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically dark red when mature, containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla has elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a dense branching pattern. The small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, berry-like drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in the wet tropical forests of the country. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island's natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability to humid climates make it a desirable addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm temperatures and high rainfall, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean.
