                <h1>Actinodaphne stenophylla</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its timber, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla has elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and slightly woody, with a rough, brownish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with greenish-white petals, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few localized areas within lowland and hill forests. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Actinodaphne stenophylla is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population declining in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a tropical garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne stenophylla is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for smaller plants and animals. Its dense canopy helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>
