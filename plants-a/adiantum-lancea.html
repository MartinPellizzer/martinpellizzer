                <h1>Adiantum lancea</h1>
<p>Adiantum lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are finely divided and often have a silvery underside. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, upright sporangia on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum lancea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lancea has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a slender, pointed tip, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a clumping habit. Adiantum lancea produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dark brown, club-shaped sorus containing spores, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lancea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern is commonly associated with temperate and subtropical climates. It is known for its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is well-adapted to humid conditions and is often seen growing along streams or in rocky crevices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lancea was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and moist environments, where it can thrive in shaded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland habitats and along stream banks, where it benefits from high humidity and indirect sunlight. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting in gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that in some areas, it may become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
