<p>Alchemilla alpina var. grossidens, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of broad, waxy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to tolerate cold and dry conditions.</p>
