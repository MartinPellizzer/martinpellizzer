                <h1>Acroelytrum urvillei</h1>
<p>Acroelytrum urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's acroelytrum, is a unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often tubular or spire-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense, showy arrangements.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroelytrum urvillei has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, featuring five petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroelytrum urvillei is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant thrives in shaded understory environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally restricted species with specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroelytrum urvillei was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia through human activity, particularly in agricultural and urban expansion areas.</p>
<p>It has established populations in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, where it thrives in disturbed environments. The plant's introduction is likely due to its adaptability to a wide range of soil types and its ability to tolerate environmental stress. It is often found growing along roadsides, in abandoned fields, and in secondary forests.</p>
<p>While it is not considered invasive in most regions, its distribution continues to expand with ongoing land-use changes.</p>
