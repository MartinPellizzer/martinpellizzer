                <h1>Achillea × rozaliae</h1>
<p>Achillea × rozaliae, commonly known as the Rozalia yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery foliage and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is native to the United States, particularly in regions like California and Oregon, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Rozalia yarrow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × rozaliae has basal leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × rozaliae is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these regions, its current distribution has expanded to include parts of southern Europe and some cultivated areas. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural range and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest for conservation and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × rozaliae is a hardy perennial known for its showy, flat umbels of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in full sun and becoming dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stalks to encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × rozaliae is a hardy perennial that provides nectar and pollen for a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties.
