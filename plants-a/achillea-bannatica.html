                <h1>Achillea bannatica</h1>
<p>Achillea bannatica, commonly known as the Bann common yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features a robust root system and upright, branching stems that are covered with grayish-white hairs. Its basal leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in summer.</p>
<p>Achillea bannatica is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bannatica has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a lanceolate shape, rough texture, and a silver-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bannatica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of northern China and the Russian Far East, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea bannatica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bannatica is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers, commonly found in wetland areas.</p>
