<p>Aphragmus altaicus, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Aphragmus altaicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
