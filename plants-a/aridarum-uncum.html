<p>Aridarum uncum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Aridarum uncum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
