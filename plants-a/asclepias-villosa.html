                    <h1>Asclepias villosa</h1>
<p>Asclepias villosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a native North American plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its unique seed pods contain silky, white filaments that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Asclepias villosa plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host for their larvae.</p>
