                    <h1>Acer hispanicum f. montsiccianum</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum f. montsiccianum, commonly known as the Montsiccian maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Spanish maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique foliage, it is highly valued by botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
