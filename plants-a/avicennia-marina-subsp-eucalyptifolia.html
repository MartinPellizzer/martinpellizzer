<p>Avicennia marina subsp.</p>
<p>eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the mangrove with eucalyptus-like leaves, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits salt excretion through its leaves, a key adaptation to its coastal habitat. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting biodiversity in intertidal zones.</p>
