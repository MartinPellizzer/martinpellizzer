                <h1>Acmella radicans var. debilis</h1>
<p>Acmella radicans var. debilis, commonly known as the creeping shotrag, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with prominent, showy anthers that release pollen in response to touch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in humid climates.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it both a useful and aesthetically pleasing addition to botanical gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella radicans var. debilis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a light green bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellow with red centers, and have a distinctive structure with five petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella radicans var. debilis is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, as well as some regions in the Caribbean. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though it is not yet classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella radicans var. debilis is a low-maintenance, ornamental plant known for its vibrant, colorful bracts.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings, which root easily in moist soil or water. This species has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering, and regular fertilization during the growing season promotes lush growth. Pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages branching, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
