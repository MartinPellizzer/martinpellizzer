                <h1>Achyrocline rugosa</h1>
<p>Achyrocline rugosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture.</p>
<p>Achyrocline rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline rugosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 2 to 6 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and erect, with a slightly hairy surface and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's tropical and subtropical habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline rugosa is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and dry forests. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. It is also present in parts of southern Florida and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline rugosa was mainly introduced to control the spread of invasive plants in wetland areas.</p>
<p>It is often used as a biocontrol agent due to its ability to feed on specific invasive species. The plant is native to the Americas but has been introduced to various regions for ecological management purposes. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is known for its aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had mixed results, with some studies showing it can become invasive itself in certain ecosystems.</p>
