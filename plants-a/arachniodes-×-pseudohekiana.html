<p>Arachniodes × pseudohekiana, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid fern species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble the delicate patterns of spider webs, giving it its genus name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
