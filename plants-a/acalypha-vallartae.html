<p>Acalypha vallartae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and unique floral structures.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha vallartae belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as magnolias and laurels.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical species, often with specialized floral structures. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf," characterized by their showy flowers and hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha vallartae, a specific type of velvetleaf native to Mexico, known for its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha vallartae is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state of Baja California. It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal and desert environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha vallartae was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
