                <h1>Adenophora coronata</h1>
<p>Adenophora coronata, commonly known as the crown bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically borne in terminal clusters. Adenophora coronata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronata has oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a slightly hairy lower surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a somewhat woody texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and display a pale blue to violet color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, including provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Gansu.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its native habitat, which are characterized by limited soil nutrients and intense sunlight. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in temperate alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenophora coronata is valued for its ornamental flowers and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands where it can thrive without competition from other vegetation. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
