                    <h1>Arenaria verna var. juniperina</h1>
<p>Arenaria verna var. juniperina, commonly known as Juniperleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common sandwort, but it is distinguished by its more compact form and foliage resembling that of juniper.</p>
