                        <h1>Abutilon grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Abutilon grandiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild.</p>
