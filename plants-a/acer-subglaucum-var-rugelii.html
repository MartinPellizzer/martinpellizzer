                <h1>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii</h1>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii, commonly known as the rugelii maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes glaucous underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in inflorescences, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily within the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, where it grows in moist, temperate forests. Currently, its distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, mostly in remote mountainous areas. It thrives in cool, shaded environments at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii is a deciduous ornamental tree known for its striking autumn foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The tree follows a typical temperate growth cycle, shedding leaves in winter and producing new growth in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of insect and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. The tree's wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and decorative crafts, contributing to local economies. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though specific meanings are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than industrial, supporting biodiversity and landscape aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subglaucum var. rugelii has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Carnosum', known for their striking autumn colors and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrids involving this species often exhibit improved hardiness and unique foliage patterns, making them desirable for horticultural use. Its cultivars and hybrids are valued for their adaptability to various climates and their ability to add visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer subglaucum var. rugelii holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and genetic versatility.</p>
