                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
