<p>Asperula aparine, commonly known as sticky willow or velvetleaf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, blue-black berries. Asperula aparine thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to spread via runners make it both ornamental and sometimes invasive in certain regions.</p>
