                    <h1>Argythamnia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Argythamnia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and a low profile to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The leaves are often modified into spines, which help to deter herbivores and minimize transpiration.</p>
