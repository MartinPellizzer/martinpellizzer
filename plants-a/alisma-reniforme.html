                    <h1>Alisma reniforme</h1>
<p>Alisma reniforme, commonly known as broadleaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in waterlogged soils and absorb nutrients. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that float on the water surface or grow partially submerged. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Alisma reniforme plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
