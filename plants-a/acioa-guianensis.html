                <h1>Acioa guianensis</h1>
<p>Acioa guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan acioa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acioa guianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa guianensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels off in strips, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa guianensis is primarily native to Brazil North and French Guiana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa guianensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often used for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
