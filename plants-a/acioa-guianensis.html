                <h1>Acioa guianensis</h1>
<p>Acioa guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan acioa, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acioa guianensis is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa guianensis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from February to April, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in the plant's anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa guianensis is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin, primarily found in northern South America, including countries such as Brazil, Venezuela, and Guyana.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also extends to parts of Central America and the Caribbean, though it remains most abundant in its native range. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests. Acioa guianensis is typically found at altitudes below 300 meters, where the climate is warm and moist year-round.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acioa guianensis is a fast-growing, tropical tree known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle includes a rapid initial growth phase followed by a slower maturation period, typically reaching maturity within 5-7 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and promote air circulation are recommended. It is susceptible to pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot, so regular monitoring and proper care are essential.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can improve soil fertility and provide natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
