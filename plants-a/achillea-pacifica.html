                <h1>Achillea pacifica</h1>
<p>Achillea pacifica, commonly known as Coastachen, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are finely divided and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea pacifica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern that rises from the base. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica is primarily native to the western coast of North America, specifically from British Columbia southward through California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal prairies, dunes, and moist meadows along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with maritime climates. It is particularly common in areas with mild, wet winters and cool, dry summers.</p>
<p>Its range extends into parts of Oregon and Washington as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. This plant has been documented in states like Oregon and Washington. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often found growing in naturalized settings.</p>
