                <h1>Achillea pacifica</h1>
<p>Achillea pacifica, commonly known as Pacific yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are finely divided and gray-green in color, while its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Pacific yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette pattern and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base and branching slightly towards the top. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes coastal areas along the Pacific Northwest, particularly in regions with moist, temperate climates. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, dunes, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea pacifica is considered a species of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea pacifica involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is recommended, along with regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica is a native flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, by offering food and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared resources and pest deterrence. Additionally, it helps with erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Achillea pacifica also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pacifica is a flowering plant native to the western United States, known for its medicinal properties and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally by Native American tribes for its healing properties, particularly in treating skin conditions and as an antiseptic. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its essential oils may have potential in the fragrance and cosmetic industries. The plant also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
