                <h1>Acis rosea</h1>
<p>Acis rosea, commonly known as the pink snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Acis rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis rosea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a shiny green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are delicate, pinkish-white with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis rosea is primarily native to Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Mediterranean region, specifically in the island of Corsica and the island of Sardinia. It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in dry and sunny environments. Acis rosea is commonly seen in coastal cliffs and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the unique ecological conditions of these Mediterranean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis rosea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems.</p>
