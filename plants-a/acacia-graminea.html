                        <h1>Acacia graminea</h1>
<p>Acacia graminea, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia graminea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry regions.</p>
