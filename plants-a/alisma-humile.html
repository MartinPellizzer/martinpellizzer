                    <h1>Alisma humile</h1>
<p>Alisma humile, commonly known as the dwarf water plant, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Alisma humile plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
