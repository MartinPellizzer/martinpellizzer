<p>Aspidium leucophlebium, commonly known as the silver-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery or whitish coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Aspidium leucophlebium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
