<p>Abies beshanzuensis, commonly known as the Beshanzu fir, is a rare conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and measure around 5â€“7 centimeters in length. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
