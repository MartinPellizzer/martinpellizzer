                <h1>Actinidia holotricha</h1>
<p>Actinidia holotricha, commonly known as the fuzzy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The fuzzy texture of its leaves gives it its common name, making it easily distinguishable from other Actinidia species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia holotricha has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing or trailing vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, containing numerous seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia holotricha is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. The species is commonly found in forests and shaded areas, often growing along stream banks or in valley bottoms.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports a variety of wildlife, making it an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia holotricha was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of botanical research and horticultural experimentation.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating new plant species. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the North Island. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its invasive tendencies.</p>
