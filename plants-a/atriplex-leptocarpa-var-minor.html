                    <h1>Atriplex leptocarpa var. minor</h1>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa var. minor, commonly known as saltbush or shadscale, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is often found growing in sandy or saline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and salt-excreting glands allow it to thrive in conditions where other plants struggle.</p>
