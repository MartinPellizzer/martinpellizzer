                <h1>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a cultivar of the maple tree characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental planting in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum has large, broadly ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a serrated edge; the leaves are alternate in arrangement and can reach up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum is a rare plant species native to the western United States, specifically found in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the coastal mountain ranges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This variety typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum is a unique cultivar of the maple tree known for its narrow, elongated leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings offering the most reliable results. This slow-growing tree has a long growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil with regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to scale insects and leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and ornamental grasses in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil stability and supports a healthy ecosystem by offering habitat and resources to a variety of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum is a rare variant of the bigleaf maple known for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in some traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it may have potential for local use in traditional remedies, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regional ecosystems and may be revered in indigenous practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their unique foliage colors and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybridization with other maple species to create new varieties with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness or more vibrant leaf coloration. These hybrids often exhibit greater adaptability to different climates, making them valuable in horticultural breeding programs. The plant's cultivars and hybrids are widely appreciated for their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to contribute to diverse and visually striking plant collections.</p>
