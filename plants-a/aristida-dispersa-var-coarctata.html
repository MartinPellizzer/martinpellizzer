                    <h1>Aristida dispersa var. coarctata</h1>
<p>Aristida dispersa var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly, awned lemmas, which are typical features of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to colonize bare ground, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
