                <h1>Adolia discolor</h1>
<p>Adolia discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered adolia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adolia discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia discolor has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-7 cm in length, and a deep green color on the upper surface with a lighter, almost white underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a pale yellow color and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia discolor is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks where the soil is moist and rich in organic matter. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia discolor was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and gardening.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its spread has been documented in several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it poses a potential threat to native plant species in invaded areas.</p>
