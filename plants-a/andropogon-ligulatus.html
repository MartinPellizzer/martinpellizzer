                <h1>Andropogon ligulatus</h1>
<p>Andropogon ligulatus, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, forming dense clumps with narrow, flat leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Flatleaf bluestem is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
