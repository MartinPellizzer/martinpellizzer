                <h1>Adiantum afrorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum afrorum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and turn reddish-brown when mature.</p>
<p>Adiantum afrorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum afrorum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a finely divided, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically light green in color, with a slightly glossy surface. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright.</p>
<p>This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, and the plant relies on spore dispersal through wind, rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
