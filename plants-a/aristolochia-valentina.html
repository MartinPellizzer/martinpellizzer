<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, waxy, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Its flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
