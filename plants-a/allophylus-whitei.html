<p>Allophylus whitei, commonly known as the white's alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Allophylus whitei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
