                <h1>Adesmia wallichiana</h1>
<p>Adesmia wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan legume, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root nodules. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of white or pale purple. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Adesmia wallichiana is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia wallichiana has small, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dull green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green to brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia wallichiana is primarily native to the Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine environments at high elevations. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with mountainous terrains. It is well adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adesmia wallichiana is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia wallichiana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in mountainous areas. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural interest and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
