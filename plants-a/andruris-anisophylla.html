<p>Andruris anisophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Andruris anisophylla is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
