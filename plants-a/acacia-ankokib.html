                        <h1>Acacia ankokib</h1>
<p>Acacia ankokib, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Acacia ankokib is often found in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ankokib is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in the eastern and northern parts. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in savannas, forests, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acacia ankokib plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ankokib was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for dryland environments. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands in several parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
