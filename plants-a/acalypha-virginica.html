<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive floral and vegetative features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphological features and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Indian spinach," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha virginica, a specific type of plant native to North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
