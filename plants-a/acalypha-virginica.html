<p>Acalypha virginica, commonly known as Virgin's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring smooth, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha virginica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 3 to 8 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is typically branching and shrub-like. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts that resemble petals, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in moist, wetland soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations mostly confined to specific regions within its native range. It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, often growing in moist, acidic soils. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters, and is associated with riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted distribution and habitat specificity make it vulnerable to environmental changes and land-use alterations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica is a fast-growing, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States, commonly found in moist woodland areas.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a single growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>
