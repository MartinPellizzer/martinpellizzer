                <h1>Acinodendron campestre</h1>
<p>Acinodendron campestre, commonly known as the creeping acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acinodendron campestre is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron campestre has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron campestre is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally reported in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the tropical regions of the Old World.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron campestre was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned pastures. The plant has a spreading growth habit and can form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion. However, its rapid growth may lead to the displacement of native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>It is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance.</p>
