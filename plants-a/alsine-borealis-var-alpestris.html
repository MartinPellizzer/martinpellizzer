<p>Alsine borealis var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats or cushions. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
