<p>Acanthopanax sessiliflorus var. parviceps, commonly known as the small-headed dogwood, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or forested habitats at higher elevations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax sessiliflorus var. parviceps is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forests and shrublands at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. This variant is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of northern China, such as the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood and coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax sessiliflorus var. parviceps was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of East Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan. This plant thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.
