                <h1>Acrolasia aurea</h1>
<p>Acrolasia aurea, commonly known as the golden acrolasia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Acrolasia aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia aurea has alternate, elliptical leaves that are bright green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia aurea is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia aurea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plants. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade, which contributes to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its population and protect local ecosystems.</p>
