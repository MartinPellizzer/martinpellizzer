                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone everlasting, is a flowering plant native to calcareous grasslands and rocky soils in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. It has adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
