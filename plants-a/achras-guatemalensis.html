                <h1>Achras guatemalensis</h1>
<p>Achras guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan achiote, is a small, evergreen tree native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras guatemalensis has large, palm-like leaves that are typically compound, with a broad, feather-like appearance, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can reach up to 3 meters in height.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras guatemalensis is primarily native to Central America, particularly Guatemala and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical dry forests and lowland areas. This plant thrives in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near human settlements.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras guatemalensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for saline and poor soils. This plant is often used for ornamental purposes because of its unique, spiny leaves and showy yellow flowers. It has also been introduced to some regions of the southern United States as a landscape plant.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
