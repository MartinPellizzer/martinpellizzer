<p>Asplenium laciniatum subsp.</p>
<p>tenuicaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
