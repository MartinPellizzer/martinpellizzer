<p>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp.</p>
<p>lanata, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia subsp.</p>
<p>lanata has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a silver-gray underside due to dense pubescence, and a dark green upper surface. The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is clump-forming.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
