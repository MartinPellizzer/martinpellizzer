                    <h1>Adelia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Adelia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular adelia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
