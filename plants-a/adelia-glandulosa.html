                <h1>Adelia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Adelia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular adelia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia glandulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, typically a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia glandulosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to semi-aquatic environments and is often associated with cypress swamps and pine flatwoods. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions, making it a characteristic species of the southeastern U.S. ecosystem.</p>
<p>Adelia glandulosa plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia glandulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravel pits, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in regions with temperate climates. This plant has spread rapidly due to its ability to establish itself in nutrient-poor environments. It is often considered an invasive species in parts of its range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activity, particularly land development and soil disturbance.</p>
