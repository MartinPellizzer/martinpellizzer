                    <h1>Astragalus wachschi</h1>
<p>Astragalus wachschi, commonly known as the waxleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus wachschi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its hardiness and unique foliage.</p>
