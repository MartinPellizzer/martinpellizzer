                    <h1>Andrachne cadishaco</h1>
<p>Andrachne cadishaco, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>Andrachne cadishaco is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
