                        <h1>Abarema harmsii</h1>
<p>Abarema harmsii, commonly known as the pink stinkwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with a woody stem and can grow up to several meters in height. It is adapted to humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema harmsii is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>This species is found in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. Abarema harmsii is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema harmsii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states, including São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Pará, where it has established itself in disturbed and urban environments. The plant's introduction is likely associated with the trade of ornamental plants, which has facilitated its spread beyond cultivation. Although it is not yet considered invasive, its potential to spread further is a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution and impact is essential to manage its ecological effects.</p>
