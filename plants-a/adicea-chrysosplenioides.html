                <h1>Adicea chrysosplenioides</h1>
<p>Adicea chrysosplenioides, commonly known as the golden spleenwort, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, clustered leaves that are pinnately divided. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adicea chrysosplenioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea chrysosplenioides has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea chrysosplenioides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist, shaded habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and partial to full shade. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adicea chrysosplenioides is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea chrysosplenioides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands through human activity, particularly during the colonial era.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and is generally not a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
