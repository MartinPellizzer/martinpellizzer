                    <h1>Arabis crassifolia</h1>
<p>Arabis crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, broad leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Arabis crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
