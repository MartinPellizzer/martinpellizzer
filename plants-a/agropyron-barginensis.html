<p>Agropyron barginensis, commonly known as the Bargin grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with leathery, awnless glumes. It is adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Agropyron barginensis is often found in steppe and desert grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
