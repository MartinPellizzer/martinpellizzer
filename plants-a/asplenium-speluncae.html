                    <h1>Asplenium speluncae</h1>
<p>Asplenium speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to life in dark, humid cave environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky crevices and soil that is rich in organic matter, often found in subterranean habitats. The plant has reduced leaves and lacks true roots, relying instead on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are dispersed in the moist, still air of caves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered an indicator species for cave ecosystems and is often protected due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
