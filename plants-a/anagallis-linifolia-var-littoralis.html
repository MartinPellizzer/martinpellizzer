                    <h1>Anagallis linifolia var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Anagallis linifolia var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal pimpernel, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is a hardy and resilient plant, well-suited to coastal environments with limited soil nutrients.</p>
