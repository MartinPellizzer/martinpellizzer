<p>Actephila nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces upright spikes of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila nitida has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila nitida is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent, though it remains most common in its native range. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along riverbanks. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actephila nitida is a hardy, evergreen shrub known for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer, which root easily when placed in a moist, well-draining medium. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, making it suitable for both container and in-ground cultivation.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourages new growth.
