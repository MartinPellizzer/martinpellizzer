<p>Acacia latistipulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching habit and its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and can remain viable for several years.</p>
<p>Acacia latistipulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia latistipulata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and central parts of the continent, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with tropical and subtropical climates. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Acacia latistipulata is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia latistipulata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Australia, where it has been planted for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reclamation projects. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, leading to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
