<p>Acalypha fruticosa, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by these showy leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa is also valued for its adaptability and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color that may turn reddish in some varieties.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green to reddish bark, and grows in a bushy, spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including the Pacific Islands and some tropical regions of the Americas, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories or along stream banks. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are threatened by habitat loss and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa is a shrub-like plant known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value, commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
