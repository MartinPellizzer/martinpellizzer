                    <h1>Aristida riparia</h1>
<p>Aristida riparia, commonly known as rivergrass or watergrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Aristida riparia is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
