                    <h1>Acacia aneura var. brachystachya</h1>
<p>Acacia aneura var. brachystachya, commonly known as the stumpy wattle, is a small, shrub-like acacia native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical, yellow-green foliage and its distinctive, small, globular flower heads. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with its thick, waxy leaves reducing water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>The stumpy wattle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
