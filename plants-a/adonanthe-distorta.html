                <h1>Adonanthe distorta</h1>
<p>Adonanthe distorta, commonly known as the twisted leaf fern, is a unique species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its slow growth rate. Its leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Adonanthe distorta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe distorta has leaves that are broad, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a waxy surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe distorta is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of tropical forests. It is often associated with areas rich in biodiversity and high rainfall.</p>
<p>Adonanthe distorta is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe distorta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is considered an environmental weed, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
