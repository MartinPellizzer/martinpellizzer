                    <h1>Aleuritopteris argentea var. flava</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris argentea var. flava, commonly known as the golden cliff brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of golden to yellowish hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or moist soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery sheen that enhances its ornamental value.</p>
