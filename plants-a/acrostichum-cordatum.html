                <h1>Acrostichum cordatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a soft, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cordatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cordatum has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat fibrous with a pale greenish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruits are slender, three-lobed berries that split open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cordatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, mangroves, and along the shores of rivers and coastal regions. This plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cordatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in coastal and estuarine environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in salt marshes and tidal areas, thriving in brackish water conditions. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, which allows it to establish itself in these unique habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential impacts on native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
