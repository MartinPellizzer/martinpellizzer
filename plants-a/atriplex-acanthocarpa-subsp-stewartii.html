<p>Atriplex acanthocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>The subspecies is often found in coastal and inland dunes, contributing to stabilization and ecological diversity in these habitats.</p>
