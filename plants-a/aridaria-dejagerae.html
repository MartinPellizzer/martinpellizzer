                    <h1>Aridaria dejagerae</h1>
<p>Aridaria dejagerae, commonly known as the De Jager's aridaria, is a rare succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
