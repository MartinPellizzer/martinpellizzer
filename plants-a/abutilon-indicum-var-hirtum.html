                        <h1>Abutilon indicum var. hirtum</h1>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. hirtum, commonly known as velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive tactile appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems are adaptations to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. hirtum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also occasionally cultivated in regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. hirtum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates that provide ample sunlight and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers, which mimic its native habitat in Southeast Asia. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy foliage. It has been introduced to parts of the United States, particularly in the southern states, where it thrives in gardens and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems.</p>
