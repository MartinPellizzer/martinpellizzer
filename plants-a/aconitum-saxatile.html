                <h1>Aconitum saxatile</h1>
<p>Aconitum saxatile, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aconitum saxatile thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is notable for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum saxatile has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and grayish-green, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, fibrous, and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum saxatile is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, often growing on limestone or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and forest edges in these regions. It is a member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant in much of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum saxatile was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable alpine or subalpine habitats, often as a result of horticultural interest or ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. This plant has been reported in parts of Europe, particularly in the Alps, and has occasionally spread to neighboring regions. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other Aconitum species.</p>
