                <h1>Aechmea skotakii</h1>
<p>Aechmea skotakii, commonly known as the Skotak's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with vibrant red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are typically dark green with white or silver markings, enhancing its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea skotakii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea skotakii has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green to bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, fibrous stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows underground. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by colorful bracts, with white or pale pink petals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry containing small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
