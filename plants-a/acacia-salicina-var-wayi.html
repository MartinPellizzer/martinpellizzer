                        <h1>Acacia salicina var. wayi</h1>
<p>Acacia salicina var. wayi, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia salicina var. wayi is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia, including parts of South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback, including high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the inland areas of the continent where it thrives in dry, open environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia salicina var. wayi was mainly introduced to specific regions in Australia, particularly in the eastern and southern areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. This variety is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native habitats.</p>
