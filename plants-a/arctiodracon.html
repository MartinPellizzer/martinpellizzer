                    <h1>Arctiodracon</h1>
<p>Arctiodracon, commonly known as the dragon's claw, is a unique plant characterized by its striking, claw-like leaves that resemble the talons of a mythical creature.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant's botanical features include a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and small, pale green leaves that are thick and leathery. It produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability to harsh environments, Arctiodracon is often cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens.</p>
