                    <h1>Amphiglossa susannae</h1>
<p>Amphiglossa susannae, commonly known as the Susanna's orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in rocky, humid environments, thriving in the cloud forests where it receives dappled sunlight. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds, which are attracted by its nectar and vibrant hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphiglossa susannae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
