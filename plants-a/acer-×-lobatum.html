                <h1>Acer × lobatum</h1>
<p>Acer × lobatum, commonly known as the hybrid maple, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Acer ginnala and Acer negundo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically lobed with a wavy margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × lobatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × lobatum is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Although it was originally confined to its native range, it has been cultivated and introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is now grown in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, commonly found in forested areas and along streambanks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and moist.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural distribution and the rarity of its occurrence in the wild, Acer × lobatum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × lobatum is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acer × lobatum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × lobatum is a hybrid maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting a range of flora and fauna. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing shade, which supports a healthy microclimate.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × lobatum is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and is widely used in landscaping and horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species, though it is less commercially valuable. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in botanical gardens and public spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × lobatum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Columnare' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their unique growth forms and striking foliage.</p>
<p>It is also the parent species in several hybrids, such as Acer × carpinifolium and Acer × pensylvanicum, which combine traits from different maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn colors, making them popular choices for landscaping. The horticultural importance of Acer × lobatum lies in its role as a foundational species in maple breeding programs.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute significantly to the diversity of cultivated maples in gardens and public spaces.</p>
