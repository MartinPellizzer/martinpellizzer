The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea shepardii has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and dark green, arranged in a rosette formation, with a blue-gray underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are composite, with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
