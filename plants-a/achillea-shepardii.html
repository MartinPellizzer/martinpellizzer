                <h1>Achillea shepardii</h1>
<p>Achillea shepardii, commonly known as Sheppard's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea shepardii has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, branching, and covered in a whitish, woolly layer, with a pale green to brownish color. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in rocky or dry habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea shepardii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, including grasslands, open woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters and dry summers. It is often seen in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of northern Baja California as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea shepardii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as intentional planting for ornamental purposes or accidental dispersal through transportation. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native ecosystems, sometimes competing with native plant species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in various regions where it has been introduced.</p>
