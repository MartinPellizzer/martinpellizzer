<p>Angiopteris multijuga, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris multijuga plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
