<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra, commonly known as the silver burweed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiky, bur-like fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and urban environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
