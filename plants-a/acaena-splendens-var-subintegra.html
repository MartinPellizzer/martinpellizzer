                <h1>Acaena splendens var. subintegra</h1>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiky, yellowish-brown flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra has compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a somewhat shrub-like habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and borne in clusters, with a structure that includes both stamens and pistils; they bloom from late winter to early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round achene enclosed in a persistent, woody bur, which disperses by wind and animal ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption and stabilizing the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the North and South Islands, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in moist, temperate environments such as forest floors and wetlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as a threatened species in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra is a hardy, low-growing shrub known for its vibrant yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in temperate climates and requiring well-drained soil and moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is necessary to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter harmful insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. subintegra is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling in the soil, supporting the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
