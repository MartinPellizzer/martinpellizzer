                <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. neapolitanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum, commonly known as the Neapolitan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features striking purple to blue, hood-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September.</p>
<p>The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is best appreciated from a safe distance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum has leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stem is upright, reaching up to 1.5 meters in height, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes cracked with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, featuring showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Dolomites. While its original range was limited to these areas, it is now found in a few isolated locations across the Alps and in parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, spires of blue or purple flowers. It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring.</p>
<p>The growth cycle begins with spring growth, flowering in midsummer, and dying back in autumn, with the rhizomes remaining dormant during winter. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in late fall to encourage healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it benefits from companion planting with hostas or ferns.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a striking alpine plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and foliage.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity by supporting a range of species. Its deep root system helps with erosion control, stabilizing soil in rocky and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by promoting healthy soil structure and supporting local food webs.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum is a member of the buttercup family known for its striking blue-violet flowers and ornamental value in gardens. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has historical significance in traditional medicine, where its alkaloids were once used for pain relief and as a poison.</p>
<p>However, due to its high toxicity, it is not used in modern industrial or economic contexts. Culturally, it has been associated with the myth of the Trojan prince Paris and has symbolic meanings in various regions.</p>
<p>Its role is primarily ornamental, though caution is required due to its potent toxicity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>neapolitanum has several popular cultivars, including 'Carnegie' and 'Bressingham Blue', which are prized for their striking blue-violet flowers and compact growth habit. It is also used in hybridization to create new varieties with improved hardiness and flower color, leading to the development of cultivars like 'Blue Magic' and 'Black Jack'.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced vigor and adaptability to different garden conditions. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded areas, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its significance in the horticultural trade.</p>
