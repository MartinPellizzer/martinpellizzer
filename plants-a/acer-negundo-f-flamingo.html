                <h1>Acer negundo f. flamingo</h1>
<p>Acer negundo f. flamingo, commonly known as the flamingo maple, is a unique cultivar of the green ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange foliage that resembles the colors of a flamingo's feathers, particularly in the fall. The plant exhibits a distinct, upright growth habit with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a vibrant color change during the autumn season.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its visual appeal in gardens and landscapes, though it is relatively rare in cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. flamingo has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a bright red or orange coloration, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often exhibits a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. flamingo is a hybrid cultivar of the box elder tree, originating from crosses between *Acer negundo* and *Acer rubrum*.</p>
<p>It is not a naturally occurring species but has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. Its native range is not well-defined due to its artificial origin, though it may have been developed in North America. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not listed in conservation status databases, but its cultivation is limited to specific horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. flamingo is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant, colorful foliage that resembles a flamingo's pink hue.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The tree grows rapidly, reaching maturity within a few years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental display and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. flamingo is a unique cultivar that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, complementing other flora with its ornamental value. The roots of this plant help in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a habitat for beneficial insects.</p>
