                    <h1>Aspilia bishoplecta</h1>
<p>Aspilia bishoplecta, commonly known as the Bishop's lectern plant, is a flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aspilia bishoplecta is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its isolated habitat, including nutrient-poor soils and a maritime climate.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
