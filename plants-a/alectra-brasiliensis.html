<p>Alectra brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a unique species of liverwort found primarily in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped thallus that resembles a miniature flower. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. Its structure consists of a flat, ribbon-like body with tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia.</p>
<p>Alectra brasiliensis plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem and is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and ecological significance.</p>
