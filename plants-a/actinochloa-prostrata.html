                <h1>Actinochloa prostrata</h1>
<p>Actinochloa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate actinochloa, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like form along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, a characteristic common among grass family members. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinochloa prostrata has prostrate growth habit with slender, branched stems that often lie flat on the ground.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly curved, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with pale green to white petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinochloa prostrata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments, marshes, and along the edges of rice paddies. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed or cultivated areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinochloa prostrata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soils in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and wetland regions where it forms dense mats. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in saline environments. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
