                    <h1>Actinochloa prostrata</h1>
<p>Actinochloa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate actinochloa, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like form along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, a characteristic common among grass family members. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
