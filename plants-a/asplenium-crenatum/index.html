                            <h1>Asplenium Crenatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium crenatum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This primitive plant belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is widely distributed across temperate regions around the world. Its distinctive features include delicate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a compact, low-growing habit. Often found growing on rocks or in crevices, it is well adapted to nutrient-poor substrates. Despite its modest size, Asplenium crenatum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
