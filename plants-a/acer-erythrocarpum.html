                <h1>Acer erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red, winged fruits that mature in late summer. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, turning red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically red or orange, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate forests at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer erythrocarpum contributes to carbon sequestration and offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a species of maple tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its fruits have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The tree's wood is valued in the furniture and construction industries due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. In cultural contexts, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often featured in local art and folklore.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and providing habitat for various species further highlights its ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orange Queen' and 'Red Sunset', which are known for their vibrant autumn foliage. Hybrids of Acer erythrocarpum are often created to enhance traits such as growth habit, color, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them popular choices for gardeners seeking colorful and hardy tree specimens.</p>
