                <h1>Acer erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are distinctive and ornamental. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, exhibiting a bright green color during the growing season and turning red in autumn.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired, red, winged samara that disperses by wind, with each fruit containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It typically thrives at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and rare plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique fruiting structures.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, which require cold stratification, or through semi-ripe cuttings taken in summer. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its bright red berries attract birds, which in turn help disperse its seeds across the landscape. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense canopy offers shade and protection, contributing to microclimate regulation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that helps bind soil in vulnerable areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and various practical applications.</p>
<p>Its edible fruits, which resemble small red apples, are used in traditional Chinese cuisine, often cooked or dried for consumption. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. The tree's wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is sometimes planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer erythrocarpum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Red Prince' and 'Crimson Glow,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors. Hybridization with other maple species, such as Acer rubrum, has led to the development of new cultivars with enhanced traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and more striking foliage, making them valuable in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer erythrocarpum and its hybrids hold significant horticultural importance in landscaped gardens and public spaces.</p>
