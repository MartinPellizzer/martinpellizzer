                <h1>Acianthera farinosa</h1>
<p>Acianthera farinosa, commonly known as the powdered orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera farinosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white or pale pink color, and they bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera farinosa is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. This orchid species prefers shaded, moist habitats within forest understories. It is often associated with rocky or clayey soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Acianthera farinosa is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera farinosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem balance.</p>
