                    <h1>Androsace diapensioides</h1>
<p>Androsace diapensioides, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Androsace diapensioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
