                    <h1>Arabidopsis ovirensis</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis ovirensis, commonly known as the Canary Island cress, is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Arabidopsis ovirensis is of interest to botanists due to its genetic simplicity and potential for studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
