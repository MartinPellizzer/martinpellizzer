                <h1>Achillea fraasii var. troiana</h1>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana, commonly known as the Troian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens.</p>
<p>The species is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological characteristics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana has leaves that are basal, lanceolate in shape, and arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, and it grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and they bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana is a rare and lesser-known variant of the yarrow family, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy and Austria.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated locations in the Dolomites. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and slopes. This plant grows at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,500 meters, where it faces harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana is a low-maintenance perennial known for its fluffy, pinkish-white flower heads and silver-gray foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and flowering in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower heads to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and food sources. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by creating a habitat for various organisms in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in its native habitat in Central Asia.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may involve its use in local recipes. Its medicinal potential remains largely unexplored, though it may possess properties similar to other members of the Asteraceae family. Industrially, it does not play a significant role in economic sectors.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in the regions where it naturally occurs, though specific meanings are not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. troiana has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Paprika' and 'Crimson Star', which are prized for their vibrant red and orange flower colors.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and hardiness. Hybrid forms of Achillea fraasii var. troiana have been developed to enhance traits like bloom duration, disease resistance, and color intensity. The plant holds horticultural importance as a member of the Asteraceae family, contributing to garden biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various climates makes it a valuable addition to both perennial borders and rock gardens.</p>
