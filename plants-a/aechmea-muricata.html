                    <h1>Aechmea muricata</h1>
<p>Aechmea muricata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically dark green with prominent white or silver markings, and they are covered in small, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>After flowering, it develops a pineapple-like fruit, which is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp.</p>
