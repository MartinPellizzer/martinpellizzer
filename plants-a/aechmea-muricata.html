                <h1>Aechmea muricata</h1>
<p>Aechmea muricata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically dark green with prominent white or silver markings, and they are covered in small, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>After flowering, it develops a pineapple-like fruit, which is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea muricata has leaves that are broad, sword-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy, dark green surface and a sharp, spiky margin.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is covered in a dense, fibrous, dark brown to black mat of roots that anchor it firmly. It produces inflorescences with clustered, violet to purple flowers that bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and form a dense network that helps in water retention and nutrient absorption.</p>
