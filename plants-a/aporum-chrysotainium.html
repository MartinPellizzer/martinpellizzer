                    <h1>Aporum chrysotainium</h1>
<p>Aporum chrysotainium, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble flames, and its long, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
