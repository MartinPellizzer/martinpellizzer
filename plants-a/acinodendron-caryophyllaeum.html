                <h1>Acinodendron caryophyllaeum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron caryophyllaeum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous aril. Its bark and wood have been historically valued for their aromatic properties and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caryophyllaeum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, typically with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-red petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caryophyllaeum is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and northern parts of the island, particularly in humid forests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with specific habitats such as riverine forests and montane regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant species in Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caryophyllaeum was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, typically found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in regions where it can thrive without excessive water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscaping. The plant's introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, fleshy leaves and showy flowers. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
