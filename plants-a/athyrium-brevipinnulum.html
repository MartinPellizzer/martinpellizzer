                    <h1>Athyrium brevipinnulum</h1>
<p>Athyrium brevipinnulum, commonly known as the short-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are shorter and more crowded than those of many other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a thin, protective layer called a indusium.</p>
<p>Athyrium brevipinnulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
