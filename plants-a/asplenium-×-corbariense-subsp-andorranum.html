<p>Asplenium × corbariense subsp.</p>
<p>andorranum, commonly known as the Andorran spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, strap-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
