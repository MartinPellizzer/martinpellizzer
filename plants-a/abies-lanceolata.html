                        <h1>Abies lanceolata</h1>
<p>Abies lanceolata, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Abies lanceolata thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lanceolata is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Arizona. This species typically grows in high-elevation areas, including mountainous regions and pine forests. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Abies lanceolata is commonly associated with the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in the western U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lanceolata was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental tree due to its attractive conical shape and needle-like foliage.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted in gardens, parks, and along roadsides for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil conditions. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain regions, outcompeting native plant species in forest understories. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its potential impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Continued monitoring is necessary to assess its long-term ecological effects in non-native habitats.</p>
