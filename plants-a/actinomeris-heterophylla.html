                <h1>Actinomeris heterophylla</h1>
<p>Actinomeris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, which can vary significantly depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette or decumbent form, and they may exhibit different shapes and sizes along the same plant.</p>
<p>Actinomeris heterophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris heterophylla has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris heterophylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in moist environments, often growing near rivers, swamps, and in dense tropical forests. Its distribution is closely associated with the region's rich biodiversity and specific ecological conditions.</p>
<p>It is not found outside of this native range in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris heterophylla was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal regions and near freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in riparian zones. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant communities.</p>
