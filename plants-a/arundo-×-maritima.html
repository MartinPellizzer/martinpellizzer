                    <h1>Arundo × maritima</h1>
<p>Arundo × maritima, commonly known as the coastal arundo, is a hybrid grass species native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, often forming dense stands along shores and dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a pioneer species and a potential invasive plant in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to harsh, maritime conditions and its role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
