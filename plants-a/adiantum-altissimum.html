                <h1>Adiantum altissimum</h1>
<p>Adiantum altissimum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, gracefully arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a delicate, lace-like appearance with finely divided leaves that are typically green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, tropical look throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum altissimum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely toothed margin and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a dark brown, round capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum altissimum is primarily native to southeastern United States, specifically the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded areas like forests and along stream banks. It thrives in acidic soils and is often found in rocky or wooded habitats.</p>
<p>Adiantum altissimum is a hardy plant that can tolerate partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum altissimum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas and along stream margins. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes and can form dense mats that outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
