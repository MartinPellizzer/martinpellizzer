                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. vulgaris, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces spikelets that contain small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is widely used in lawns and pastures due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its ability to form a thick sod makes it resistant to foot traffic and erosion.</p>
