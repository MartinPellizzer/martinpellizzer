                <h1>Actinophloeus cuneatus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved actinophloeus, is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round drupe with a thick, leathery skin.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus cuneatus has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus cuneatus is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities. It thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas with sufficient sunlight and moderate humidity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus cuneatus was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in agricultural and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in biological control programs due to its specific feeding habits on target weeds. The distribution of this plant has been expanding in regions where invasive vegetation is prevalent. It has been reported in several countries across Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has helped reduce the spread of certain noxious weeds, although it requires careful monitoring to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
