                <h1>Achillea pseudotanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea pseudotanacetifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudotanacetifolia has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing seeds to be carried over long distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudotanacetifolia is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often associated with Mediterranean climates. It is typically found in open habitats like scrublands, grasslands, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the western Mediterranean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pseudotanacetifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, often along roadsides and in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded across several states, including Washington, Oregon, and California.</p>
