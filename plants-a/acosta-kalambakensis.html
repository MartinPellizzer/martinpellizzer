                <h1>Acosta kalambakensis</h1>
<p>Acosta kalambakensis, commonly known as the Kalambaken mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its rhizomes are short and robust, anchoring it to rocky substrates in its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta kalambakensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta kalambakensis has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta kalambakensis is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in the countries of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the cloud forests and humid montane areas at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in forest understories. Its natural habitat is characterized by high biodiversity and unique microclimates typical of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta kalambakensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and adequate sunlight. The plant has been observed spreading in tropical and subtropical climates. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is now found in several locations across its introduced range.</p>
