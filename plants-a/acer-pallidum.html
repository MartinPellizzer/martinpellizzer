                <h1>Acer pallidum</h1>
<p>Acer pallidum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are pale green on top and white underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The white maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pallidum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-8 cm in length, with a pale green upper surface and a whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pallidum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, with scattered populations in some parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils within forested landscapes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer pallidum is classified as a species of concern and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pallidum is a small, ornamental tree known for its delicate white flowers and autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pallidum is relatively slow, with flowering typically occurring in early spring.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in vulnerable conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pallidum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy white flowers in the spring. Its extensive root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in riparian areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pallidum is a small deciduous tree known for its delicate white flowers and is primarily valued for its ornamental uses in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in certain traditional herbal teas. The tree has limited industrial or economic significance due to its small size and low yield of usable materials. In cultural contexts, it is often symbolized as a representation of purity and resilience.</p>
<p>However, its medicinal applications are minimal, with only anecdotal use in some traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pallidum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Emerald Queen' and 'Sargentii', known for their striking white to pale green foliage. Hybrids such as Acer × carpinifolium and Acer × lindenii have been developed to enhance leaf color and growth habits. These plants are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique foliage makes them valuable additions to modern horticultural collections.</p>
