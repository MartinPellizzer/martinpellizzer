<p>Androsace nivalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or alpine displays.</p>
