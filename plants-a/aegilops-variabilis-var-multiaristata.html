                    <h1>Aegilops variabilis var. multiaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops variabilis var. multiaristata, commonly known as the multibristle wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy lemma, with the distinctive multi-bristled awns that give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It is an important species in the study of wild relatives of cultivated barley due to its genetic diversity and potential for crop improvement.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject in both ecological and agricultural research.</p>
