                <h1>Acrostichum inversum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum inversum, commonly known as the upside-down fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that appear to be inverted compared to typical ferns, with the fertile spore-bearing structures positioned on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded lobes that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum inversum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inversum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 30â€“60 cm long and have a leathery texture with serrated edges. The stem is upright and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single trunk. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring, and is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inversum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and sandy or muddy soils. It is often associated with brackish or saltwater environments due to its tolerance for saline conditions.</p>
<p>Acrostichum inversum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum inversum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial to full shade. This plant is often associated with coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
