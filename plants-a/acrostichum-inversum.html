<p>Acrostichum inversum, commonly known as the upside-down fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that appear to be inverted compared to typical ferns, with the fertile spore-bearing structures positioned on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded lobes that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum inversum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
