<p>Agropyron repens subsp.</p>
<p>littoreum, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a common component of coastal dunes and shorelines. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
