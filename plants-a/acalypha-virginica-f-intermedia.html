                <h1>Acalypha virginica f. intermedia</h1>
<p>Acalypha virginica f. intermedia, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica f. intermedia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length, and have serrated margins. The stem is erect and somewhat woody with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are often brightly colored, blooming from June to September and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica f. intermedia is a variant of the yellow madrone, native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Florida and the Gulf Coast. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This plant typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is considered stable, though it is not widely cultivated and remains a minor component of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica f. intermedia is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer, which root easily when placed in a moist, well-draining medium. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about two to three years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers loamy soil with good drainage and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote dense growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its visual appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica f. intermedia is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, colorful bracts. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in wetland and riparian areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
