                            <h1>Acosta Ligustica</h1>
<p>Sweet cicely, scientifically known as Acosta ligustica, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is prized for its aromatic, licorice-like flavor, which makes it a sought-after ingredient in traditional culinary and medicinal practices. Despite its beauty and utility, the plant faces significant threats from habitat loss and overharvesting, leading to its classification as endangered in several regions. Its unique appearance, with feathery leaves and small white flowers, adds to its appeal among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve this remarkable species for future generations.</p>
