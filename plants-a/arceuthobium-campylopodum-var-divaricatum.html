                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum var. divaricatum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thread-like stems. The plant is known for its unique dispersal mechanism, where its seeds are propelled through a explosive mechanism called a "cannonball" dispersal. It primarily parasitizes grasses and is found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
