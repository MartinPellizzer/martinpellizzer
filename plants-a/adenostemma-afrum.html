                <h1>Adenostemma afrum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma afrum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenostemma afrum is also noted for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma afrum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in dense clusters. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
