                <h1>Adenostemma afrum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma afrum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pink to purple in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma afrum has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically green on top and slightly hairy underneath, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma afrum is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it occurs in the Cape Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and possibly Mozambique. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Adenostemma afrum typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenostemma afrum is a hardy, flowering plant commonly grown in subtropical and tropical regions for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Adenostemma afrum is typically perennial, with flowering occurring during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenostemma afrum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Adenostemma afrum plays an important ecological role in maintaining habitat structure and supporting wildlife in its native environments.</p>
