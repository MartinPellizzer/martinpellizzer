                    <h1>Astragalus eucosmus f. albinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus eucosmus f. albinus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a rare and striking variant of the milkvetch genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange hues of its relatives. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics.</p>
