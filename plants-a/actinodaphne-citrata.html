<p>Actinodaphne citrata, commonly known as the citron laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its essential oils are also used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne citrata has elliptical or ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and through the shedding of the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Caribbean. The plant's ability to thrive in warm climates has led to its establishment in several non-native locations. However, it is not considered invasive in most of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to regions where it can receive adequate sunlight and moisture.</p>
