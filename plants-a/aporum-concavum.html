<p>Aporum concavum, commonly known as the concave aporum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves with a distinct concave shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aporum concavum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
