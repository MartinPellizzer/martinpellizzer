<p>Agropyron remotiflorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>Agropyron remotiflorum is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
