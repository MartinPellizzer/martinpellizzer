                <h1>Acer × creticum f. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer × creticum f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf maple, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Acer caesium and Acer tatarinowii.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant is notable for its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange fruits that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × creticum f. macrophyllum has palmately compound leaves that are large, with a broad ovate shape, alternate arrangement, and a deep green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × creticum f. macrophyllum is a hybrid maple species that originates from the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically in parts of China and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with temperate climates and high-altitude environments. Currently, it is found in botanical gardens and conservation areas where it is cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, typically growing at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × creticum f. macrophyllum is a decorative maple known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental appeal and create a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
