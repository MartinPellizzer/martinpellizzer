                    <h1>Artemisia arborescens</h1>
<p>Artemisia arborescens, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
