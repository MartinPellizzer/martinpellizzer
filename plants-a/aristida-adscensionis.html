<p>Aristida adscensionis, commonly known as the ascending threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that rise upward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aristida adscensionis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed areas.</p>
