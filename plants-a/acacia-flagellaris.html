                    <h1>Acacia flagellaris</h1>
<p>Acacia flagellaris, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, flagelliform branches that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. The plant has phyllodes rather than true leaves, which are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Acacia flagellaris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in arid ecosystems.</p>
