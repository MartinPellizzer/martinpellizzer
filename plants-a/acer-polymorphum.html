<p>Acer polymorphum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can range from palmately lobed to narrowly ovate, depending on the specific variety. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer polymorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
