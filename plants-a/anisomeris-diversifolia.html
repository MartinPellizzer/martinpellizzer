                    <h1>Anisomeris diversifolia</h1>
<p>Anisomeris diversifolia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds with tufts of white hairs for wind dispersal. Anisomeris diversifolia is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
