                    <h1>Atriplex ceratophylla</h1>
<p>Atriplex ceratophylla, commonly known as shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Atriplex ceratophylla is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
