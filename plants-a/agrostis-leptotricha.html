                    <h1>Agrostis leptotricha</h1>
<p>Agrostis leptotricha, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in turfgrass systems.</p>
<p>Agrostis leptotricha is also valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense, uniform lawn.</p>
