                    <h1>Anneslia unijuga</h1>
<p>Anneslia unijuga, commonly known as the single-flowered anneslia, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, single blue or violet bell-shaped flower that blooms in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Anneslia unijuga is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
