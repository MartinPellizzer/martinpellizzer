<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well adapted to its natural environment.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis clivorum has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a lanceolate shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with each leaflet measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis clivorum is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, China Southeast, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions with moist, temperate climates. It thrives in forested areas and mountainous terrain. Its natural range includes parts of eastern Asia where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis clivorum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous or coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. It is native to South Africa but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited by climate conditions and the availability of suitable habitats.</p>
