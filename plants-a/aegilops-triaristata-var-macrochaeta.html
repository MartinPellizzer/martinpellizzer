                    <h1>Aegilops triaristata var. macrochaeta</h1>
<p>Aegilops triaristata var. macrochaeta, commonly known as the long-hair wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, hairy lemma and palea, which distinguish it from other Aegilops species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a dense, cylindrical panicle.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
