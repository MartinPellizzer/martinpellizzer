                <h1>Acer longipes</h1>
<p>Acer longipes, commonly known as the long-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with elongated lobes, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, Acer longipes is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipes has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind due to its light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including botanical gardens in Europe and North America. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer longipes is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a unique maple species known for its slow growth and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer longipes is relatively slow, with mature trees reaching heights of up to 30 feet over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in vulnerable conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer longipes contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small size and the lack of widespread cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Its wood, though not commonly used industrially, can be crafted into small furniture or decorative items due to its fine grain and durability. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions where it is associated with resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Despite its modest role, Acer longipes contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipes has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is not widely cultivated for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Baildon's White' and 'Red Dragon', which are valued for their striking fall color and unique leaf shapes. While there are few hybrids specifically developed for Acer longipes, it is occasionally crossed with other maple species to create new ornamental varieties. Its horticultural importance lies mainly in its role as a parent species in hybrid breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not commonly found in commercial horticulture.</p>
