                <h1>Acer longipes</h1>
<p>Acer longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stem and distinctive trifoliate leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Acer longipes is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipes has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of southwest China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is highly restricted, with only a few isolated populations remaining. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests and along streamside habitats. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer longipes is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique growth patterns and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer longipes is slow, with a long period of vegetative growth followed by flowering and fruiting in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in forested areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing overall ecosystem resilience.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting long-term environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipes is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability in carpentry and furniture making.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, its leaves and bark have been used in some indigenous cultures for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Economically, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions where it is admired for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely understudied compared to more widely recognized maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipes has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Argenteum' and 'Variegatum,' which display striking variegation and vibrant autumn colors. Hybrids of Acer longipes are often developed to enhance hardiness and adaptability to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and botanical gardens to add visual interest and biodiversity.</p>
