                        <h1>Acer campestre var. villosum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. villosum, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spreading habit and small, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it is less commonly cultivated than other maple species.</p>
