                <h1>Adenostyles hybrida</h1>
<p>Adenostyles hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with pink or purple hues.</p>
<p>Adenostyles hybrida is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles hybrida has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles hybrida is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with Mediterranean climates. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with chaparral and scrub habitats. It is particularly common in the coastal ranges and valleys of California.</p>
<p>Adenostyles hybrida is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate mild frost.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles hybrida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in Mediterranean climate zones where it can establish itself quickly in empty spaces. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to several regions outside its native range.</p>
