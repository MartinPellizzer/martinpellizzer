                    <h1>Arrhenatherum desertorum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum desertorum, commonly known as the desert false oat, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments.</p>
