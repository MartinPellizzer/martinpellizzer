                <h1>Actinomeris alata</h1>
<p>Actinomeris alata, commonly known as the winged fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-bearing fruits.</p>
<p>Actinomeris alata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris alata has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that develops shallow ridges as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris alata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with moist, nutrient-rich soils and is frequently seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation. Its distribution is largely restricted to eastern and central Africa due to specific climatic and ecological requirements.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris alata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and waste grounds. This plant thrives in temperate climates and can spread rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
