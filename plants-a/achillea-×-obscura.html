                <h1>Achillea × obscura</h1>
<p>Achillea × obscura, commonly known as the purple yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × obscura has compound, bipinnate leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough texture and a fern-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × obscura is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, including parts of France, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to various parts of the world, including North America, where it has been introduced and cultivated. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, meadows, and gravelly soils. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its status as a hybrid and its naturalization in new areas, it is generally not considered a threatened species, though its conservation status can vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × obscura is a hybrid perennial plant known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from early summer to late fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × obscura is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other garden species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by offering nectar and habitat for insects and small animals.</p>
