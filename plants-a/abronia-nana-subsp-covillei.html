<p>Abronia nana subsp.</p>
<p>covillei, commonly known as the Coville's dwarf lantana, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>covillei is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats. It is commonly associated with desert and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia nana subsp.</p>
<p>covillei was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It has been documented in areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and along roadsides. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation corridors.</p>
