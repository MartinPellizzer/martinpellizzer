                <h1>Adelostemma mairei</h1>
<p>Adelostemma mairei, commonly known as the Maire's false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and is often found at higher elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head.</p>
<p>Adelostemma mairei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelostemma mairei has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelostemma mairei is primarily native to the western regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It thrives in mountainous areas with a temperate climate and is commonly found in forested or shrubland habitats. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often associated with rocky or well-drained soils. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelostemma mairei was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open habitats. This plant has been reported in several countries, including China, Japan, and Hawaii, often as an invasive species. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it can outcompete native vegetation and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
