                <h1>Adenochlaena indica</h1>
<p>Adenochlaena indica, commonly known as the Indian banyan or Indian fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena indica is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena indica has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth, dark green on top, and lighter in color underneath, with a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that grows upright. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena indica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest undergrowth and is often found in areas with high humidity. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena indica is well adapted to warm climates and thrives in areas with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena indica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity.</p>
