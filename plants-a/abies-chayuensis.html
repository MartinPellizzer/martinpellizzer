<p>Abies chayuensis, commonly known as the Chayu fir, is a species of coniferous tree native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically small and clustered, with scales that are often reddish-brown in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
