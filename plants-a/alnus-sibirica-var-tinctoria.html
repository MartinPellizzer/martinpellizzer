<p>Alnus sibirica var. tinctoria, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, egg-shaped nuts in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
