                    <h1>Agropyron repens var. arundinaceum</h1>
<p>Agropyron repens var. arundinaceum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
