                    <h1>Arpitium</h1>
<p>Arpitium, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that emerge early in the spring, often before the leaves of many other plants. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with six petals, typically blooming from March to May. Arpitium prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a persistent weed and an indicator of disturbed soil.</p>
