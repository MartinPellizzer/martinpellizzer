                <h1>Acomastylis peckii</h1>
<p>Acomastylis peckii, commonly known as the Peck's acomastylis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acomastylis peckii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis peckii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis peckii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as gravelly slopes, crevices, and disturbed areas. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in full sun. It is typically associated with coastal and inland desert regions where the climate is warm and dry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis peckii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or equipment. The plant has since established itself in various habitats, including disturbed soils and open areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in the region.</p>
