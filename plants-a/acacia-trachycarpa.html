                        <h1>Acacia trachycarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia trachycarpa is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and a capacity for drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia trachycarpa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their primitive vascular structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are typically legumes, often having symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia trachycarpa, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
