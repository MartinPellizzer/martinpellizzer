                    <h1>Acacia trachycarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia trachycarpa is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and a capacity for drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
