                    <h1>Adenolepis</h1>
<p>Adenolepis, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, bottle-shaped trunks that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Adenolepis species are native to Australia and are often found in dry, sandy soils. They produce small, pea-like flowers that can be white, yellow, or purple, depending on the species.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically compound and may be shed during periods of drought, further aiding the plant's survival in harsh conditions.</p>
