<p>Arenaria rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria rotundifolia is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
