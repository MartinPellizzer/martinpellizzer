                    <h1>Andropogon distachyos subvar. alpinus</h1>
<p>Andropogon distachyos subvar. alpinus, commonly known as alpine switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-branched flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in alpine gardens.</p>
