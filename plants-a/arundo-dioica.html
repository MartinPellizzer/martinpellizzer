                    <h1>Arundo dioica</h1>
<p>Arundo dioica, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
