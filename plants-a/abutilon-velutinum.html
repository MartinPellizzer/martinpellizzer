                        <h1>Abutilon velutinum</h1>
<p>Abutilon velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf or woolly abutilon, is a shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the summer. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon velutinum is primarily native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, tropical climates. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing in dry forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Guatemala, Belize, and parts of southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon velutinum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. This species has since become naturalized in wetland and riparian habitats along the coast. It is commonly found in areas with moist soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
