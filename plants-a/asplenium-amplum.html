<p>Asplenium amplum, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of adventitious roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and may have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
