                    <h1>Alsophila × marcescens</h1>
<p>Alsophila × marcescens, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a natural hybrid between Alsophila and other species within the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk with a fibrous, bark-like covering and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of several meters, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
