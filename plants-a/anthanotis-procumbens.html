                    <h1>Anthanotis procumbens</h1>
<p>Anthanotis procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate anthanotis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats on the ground, often with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Anthanotis procumbens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
