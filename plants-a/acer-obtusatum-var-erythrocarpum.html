                <h1>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive red or orange berries that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a slight flaking texture.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum has palmate leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, arranged alternately along the stems, with a moderate size and a vibrant green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered inflorescences with yellow-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the lightweight structure of the wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in humid, temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The species grows in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, often near streams or in dense understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum is a unique maple species known for its vibrant red fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season. Regular fertilization in spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of organisms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its fruits may be occasionally foraged for local consumption.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, with some traditional uses suggesting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, supporting local wildlife and soil health. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in regional folklore or be used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, due to its rarity, its applications remain largely understudied and underutilized.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking foliage and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is also a parent in various hybrids, including crosses with other maple species that yield plants with enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of climates and its contribution to landscape diversity. The plant is favored for its vibrant autumn color and compact growth habit, making it suitable for gardens and urban settings.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic qualities, it is often used in ornamental horticulture to add visual interest to parks and private landscapes.</p>
