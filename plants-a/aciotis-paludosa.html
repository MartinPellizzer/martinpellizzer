                <h1>Aciotis paludosa</h1>
<p>Aciotis paludosa, commonly known as marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Aciotis paludosa plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis paludosa has leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring between 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to wet or muddy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis paludosa is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Guatemala, Panam√°, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in wetland and marshy habitats across these regions. It thrives in areas with high humidity and abundant moisture. Its distribution spans across several South American countries, particularly in tropical and subtropical zones.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the diverse environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis paludosa was mainly introduced to wetland and marshy areas where it can thrive in saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and consistent water levels. This plant has been noted for its ability to colonize disturbed sites, such as along the edges of ponds and in flooded meadows. Its introduction has led to changes in local vegetation patterns in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a minor invasive species with limited ecological impact.</p>
