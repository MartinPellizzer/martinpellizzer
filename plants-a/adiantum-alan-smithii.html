                    <h1>Adiantum alan-smithii</h1>
<p>Adiantum alan-smithii, commonly known as the Alan-Smith's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
