                <h1>Actinocephalus ciliatus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus ciliatus, commonly known as the featherleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with fine hairs, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ciliatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ciliatus is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy and rocky coastal environments. It is commonly associated with dune systems and is well adapted to saline and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas along the South African coastline.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ciliatus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
