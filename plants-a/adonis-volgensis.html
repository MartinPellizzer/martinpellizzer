                <h1>Adonis volgensis</h1>
<p>Adonis volgensis, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal raceme, with petals that are narrowly bell-shaped. Adonis volgensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis volgensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive cup-shaped structure and five petals, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis volgensis is primarily native to Altay, Bulgaria, Central European Russia, East European Russia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Krym, North Caucasus, Romania, South European Russia, Transcaucasus, TÃ¼rkey, Ukraine, West Siberia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in rocky and mountainous regions across these areas. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing on dry slopes and scree. Adonis volgensis is well adapted to the cold climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and sunny exposures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis volgensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is now considered a potential environmental weed, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces have raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
