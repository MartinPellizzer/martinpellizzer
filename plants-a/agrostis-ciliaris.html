                    <h1>Agrostis ciliaris</h1>
<p>Agrostis ciliaris, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted flowering heads, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis ciliaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
