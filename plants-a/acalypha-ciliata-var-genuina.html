                        <h1>Acalypha ciliata var. genuina</h1>
<p>Acalypha ciliata var. genuina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silkyleaf, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with soft, velvety textures on the upper surface and smooth, glossy undersides. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ciliata var. genuina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and has been introduced to other tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across the Indo-Malayan region, where it is a common undergrowth species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ciliata var. genuina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
