                    <h1>Amyema ficivora</h1>
<p>Amyema ficivora, commonly known as the fig wasp, is a small, non-stinging insect that plays a crucial role in the pollination of fig trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Agaonidae and is specifically adapted to the unique reproductive structures of figs. The female wasp enters the fig through a tiny opening, where she lays her eggs and simultaneously pollinates the flowers. The larvae develop inside the fig, feeding on the developing seeds.</p>
<p>This mutualistic relationship is essential for the reproduction of both the fig tree and the wasp.</p>
