<p>Alopecurus glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>tuscheticus, commonly known as the alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils of mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>The plant has slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
