                    <h1>Acrostichum apiifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum apiifolium, commonly known as the nettle fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive net-like venation pattern.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
