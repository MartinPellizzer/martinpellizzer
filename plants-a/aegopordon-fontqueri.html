<p>Aegopordon fontqueri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopordon fontqueri has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and often branched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
