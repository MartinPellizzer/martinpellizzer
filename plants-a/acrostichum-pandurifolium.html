                <h1>Acrostichum pandurifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pandurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shape that resembles a shield, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pandurifolium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pandurifolium has large, broad leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom from April to June and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruits are triangular, dry capsules that release tiny seeds through mechanical means, and the roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pandurifolium is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in wetlands, mangrove forests, and coastal areas where it can access brackish or freshwater. It is often associated with sandy or muddy soils near tidal zones.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to coastal and estuarine ecosystems in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pandurifolium was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and adaptability to humid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm climates, often found in coastal regions and wetlands. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its lush, dark green foliage. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in non-native habitats, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
