                    <h1>Aquilaria macrophylla</h1>
<p>Aquilaria macrophylla, commonly known as the gharial tree or agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and is notable for its unique ability to produce a highly valued resin called agarwood, which forms in response to fungal infections. This resin is used in perfumery, traditional medicine, and incense.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
