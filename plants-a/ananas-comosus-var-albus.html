                    <h1>Ananas comosus var. albus</h1>
<p>Ananas comosus var. albus, commonly known as the white pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its pale yellow to white flesh instead of the typical yellow-orange color.</p>
<p>This variety is native to South America, like its wild relatives, and is cultivated for its unique flavor and texture. The plant produces a single, spiky crown at the top of the fruit, similar to other pineapple varieties. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and mild taste.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic makeup, it is typically propagated through tissue culture or seed, though it is less common in commercial agriculture compared to the standard pineapple.</p>
