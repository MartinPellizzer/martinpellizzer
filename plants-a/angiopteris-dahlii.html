<p>Angiopteris dahlii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a pseudostem, which is composed of tightly packed leaf bases that resemble a tree trunk. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Angiopteris dahlii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</p>
