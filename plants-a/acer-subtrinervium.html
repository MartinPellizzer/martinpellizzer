<p>Acer subtrinervium, commonly known as the three-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes with prominent veins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer subtrinervium is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
