                        <h1>Acacia mollicoma</h1>
<p>Acacia mollicoma, commonly known as silky acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it has small, stipitate stipules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mollicoma is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open woodlands and grasslands, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with savanna ecosystems and is adapted to semi-arid climates. It plays an important role in local biodiversity and is sometimes used for its timber or as a source of fodder.</p>
<p>Acacia mollicoma is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny branches.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mollicoma was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a concern for ecological management.</p>
