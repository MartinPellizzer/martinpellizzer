                <h1>Acraea triloba</h1>
<p>Acraea triloba, commonly known as the African swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its striking black and orange wings. The plant it interacts with, such as the milkweed species, serves as a host for its larvae. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with specific plant species for both feeding and reproduction.</p>
<p>The butterfly's presence is an indicator of healthy ecosystems in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acraea triloba has leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely on the stem, and have a dark green color with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more cracked with age. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring bright yellow petals with a central blue spot, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea triloba is primarily native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It can be found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with warm climates. It is commonly associated with open woodlands and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of its host plants, which are often found in these environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea triloba was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in open habitats such as savannas, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions across Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. The plant is known for its striking blue and black wing patterns, making it a notable species in butterfly ecology. Its introduction to new regions often occurs through human activity, such as accidental transport or intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Acraea triloba has established populations in several non-native areas, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
