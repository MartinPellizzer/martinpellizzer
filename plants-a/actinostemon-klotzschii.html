                <h1>Actinostemon klotzschii</h1>
<p>Actinostemon klotzschii, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Actinostemon klotzschii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon klotzschii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon klotzschii is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with forest understories and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of northeastern and southeastern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon klotzschii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to temperate climates. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as streambanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
