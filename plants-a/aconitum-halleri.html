                <h1>Aconitum halleri</h1>
<p>Aconitum halleri, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features compound leaves with palmate lobes and grows up to 1.5 meters tall, often in rocky or alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum halleri is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it both dangerous and a subject of botanical interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum halleri has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and has a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, and borne in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or moist soil.</p>
