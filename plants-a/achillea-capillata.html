                <h1>Achillea capillata</h1>
<p>Achillea capillata, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry meadows and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in summer.</p>
<p>Achillea capillata is often used in herbal medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea capillata has narrow, linear, and slightly hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a length of up to 5 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea capillata is a flowering plant native to the western United States, primarily found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Australia. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of interest for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea capillata is a perennial plant known for its fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the roots in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in the spring helps promote healthy growth, and regular pruning after flowering encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea capillata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance biodiversity in the ecosystem. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea capillata contributes to the overall health of the environment by supporting pollinator populations and promoting ecological balance.</p>
