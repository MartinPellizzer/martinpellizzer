                <h1>Adiantum subramosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subramosum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving it a finely textured appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum subramosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum subramosum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a light green color and a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, pale green bark. The plant does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its fronds develop sporangia on the undersides, which release spores for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subramosum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. This fern is commonly associated with rocky or sandy soils in these regions. It is also found in parts of southeastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is largely limited to these specific geographic areas within the temperate southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subramosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and its ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not considered invasive in these regions.</p>
