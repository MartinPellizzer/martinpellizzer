<p>Arabidopsis trichocarpa, commonly known as black mustard, is a small flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant is widely used in botanical research due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity. Its genome has been fully sequenced, making it a model organism for studying plant genetics and development.</p>
<p>Arabidopsis trichocarpa also plays a role in ecological systems as a source of nectar for pollinators.</p>
