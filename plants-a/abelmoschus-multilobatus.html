<p>Abelmoschus multilobatus is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus multilobatus is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant typically grows in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. It is often seen in regions with well-drained soils and充足 sunlight.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of Africa as well, where it is also adapted to similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus multilobatus was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. This plant has been introduced as both a crop and a decorative species in various tropical and subtropical areas.
