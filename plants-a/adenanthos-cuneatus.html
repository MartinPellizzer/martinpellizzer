                <h1>Adenanthos cuneatus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Adenanthos cuneatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cuneatus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a glossy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green with red stamens, clustered in umbels, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils it typically inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cuneatus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in heathlands and woodlands with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenanthos cuneatus is an important component of the local flora and is often found in coastal and inland areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cuneatus was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant is well-suited to coastal environments and can thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
