                <h1>Actinocarpus stellatus</h1>
<p>Actinocarpus stellatus, commonly known as the starfruit or carambola, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star-shaped fruit when sliced. The plant is a small evergreen shrub with opposite, simple, and ovate leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit develops from the flower and is typically harvested when it turns yellow or orange.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus stellatus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in racemes, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus stellatus is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in woodland and forested areas. The plant is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and can be seen in both natural and cultivated environments. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus stellatus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has been established in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
