                        <h1>Acalypha polymorpha var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Acalypha polymorpha var. elliptica, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha polymorpha var. elliptica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and has been introduced to other tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes a variety of habitats, from wetlands to disturbed sites.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha polymorpha var. elliptica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plant species for landscaping. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its establishment in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in these regions.</p>
