                    <h1>Acacia cyclosperma</h1>
<p>Acacia cyclosperma, commonly known as the whistling thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thorned stems and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia cyclosperma plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
