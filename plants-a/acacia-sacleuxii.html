                        <h1>Acacia sacleuxii</h1>
<p>Acacia sacleuxii, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing some tolerance to saline conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia sacleuxii is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
