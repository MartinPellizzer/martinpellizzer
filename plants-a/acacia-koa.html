                    <h1>Acacia koa</h1>
<p>Acacia koa, commonly known as the Hawaiian koa tree, is a native species of Hawaii belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, sturdy trunk and bipinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz. The tree produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain seeds encased in a hard, woody shell. Acacia koa is well adapted to the dry, volcanic soils of the Hawaiian Islands and is often found in lowland and upland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its historical and cultural significance, it is also a symbol of Hawaiian identity and heritage.</p>
