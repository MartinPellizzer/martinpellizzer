                <h1>Ackama fulva</h1>
<p>Ackama fulva, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Ackama fulva is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama fulva has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama fulva is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Uganda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded slightly due to cultivation in botanical gardens and horticultural collections outside its native range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along stream banks. Ackama fulva is typically found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat degradation, leading to concerns about its long-term survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Ackama fulva is a unique and ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Ackama fulva is relatively short, with rapid growth during the warmer months and a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushiness are essential for healthy development. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
