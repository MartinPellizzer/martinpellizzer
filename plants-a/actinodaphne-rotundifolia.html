                <h1>Actinodaphne rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia has elliptical or ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. It produces small, fragrant flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns from green to yellow or red, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Pacific, primarily found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in lowland and hill forests. This species prefers moist, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Actinodaphne rotundifolia is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed germination or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within several years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or moss can enhance its growth in a tropical garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia is a valuable plant in tropical ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the area. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
