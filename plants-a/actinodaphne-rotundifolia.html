                <h1>Actinodaphne rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a rounded or slightly heart-shaped base.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, rounded drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing primarily by birds eating the fruit and spreading the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland evergreen forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with limestone hills and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also observed in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne rotundifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Caribbean. The plant's introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native habitats due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine for its aromatic leaves and essential oils.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption in new environments.</p>
