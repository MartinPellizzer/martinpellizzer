                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. lapponica</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland yarrow, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces flat, clustered flower heads composed of tiny white to pale yellow florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lapponica has leaves that are finely divided, feathery, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lapponica is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe, Scandinavia, and parts of Siberia.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and northern Asia. This variety thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 0 to 2,500 meters, depending on the region.</p>
<p>Due to its wide distribution and adaptability, it is considered a stable species with no immediate threat to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lapponica is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring helps promote healthy growth, while pruning after flowering keeps the plant compact and encourages rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
