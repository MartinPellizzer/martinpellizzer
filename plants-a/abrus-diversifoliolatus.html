                        <h1>Abrus diversifoliolatus</h1>
<p>Abrus diversifoliolatus, commonly known as the variable-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, pinnate leaves that vary in shape and size, often with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, flat, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrus diversifoliolatus belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide variety of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific arrangement of petals. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Abrus, a group of flowering plants known for their ornamental value and some species containing toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrus diversifoliolatus, a specific plant within the Abrus genus known for its distinctive leaf morphology and potential medicinal or toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus diversifoliolatus is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including moist forests and coastal areas. It is commonly distributed in the eastern and southern regions of Madagascar. The species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range, it is not widely found outside of Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus diversifoliolatus was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. The plant is known for its distinctive, colorful pods that attract birds and other wildlife, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
