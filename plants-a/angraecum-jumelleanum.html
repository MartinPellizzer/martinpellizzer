                    <h1>Angraecum jumelleanum</h1>
<p>Angraecum jumelleanum, commonly known as the Jumellean orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant produces pendulous, elongated flowers with prominent, spurred petals, typical of the Angraecum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
