                <h1>Achyrospermum serratum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum serratum, commonly known as the serrated achyrospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum serratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum serratum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open grasslands, rocky outcrops, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in savanna ecosystems. Its distribution extends into parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is adapted to withstand seasonal droughts and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum serratum was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has become a weed in several countries due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental flowers and potential medicinal properties.</p>
