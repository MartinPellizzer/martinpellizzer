                <h1>Acridocarpus scheffleri</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus scheffleri, commonly known as the white sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>The species is also cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus scheffleri has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus scheffleri is primarily native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the dry, rocky areas of the country, particularly in the northern and central regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops and in coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is an important plant in local ecosystems and has cultural significance in some communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus scheffleri was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in warm, moist environments. This plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific, including parts of Hawaii and the Philippines, where it has established itself in native ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is required to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
