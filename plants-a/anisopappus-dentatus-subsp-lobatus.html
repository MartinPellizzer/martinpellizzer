<p>Anisopappus dentatus subsp.</p>
<p>lobatus, commonly known as the hairy leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies lobatus is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form of A. dentatus.</p>
