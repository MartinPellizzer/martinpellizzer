                            <h1>Anogeissus Latifolia</h1>
<p>Anogeissus latifolia, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a valuable tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is prized for its aromatic wood, which is widely used in the production of incense, perfumes, and traditional medicines. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry deciduous forests. Its leaves are simple and alternate, while its flowers are small and fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, the species is now threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
