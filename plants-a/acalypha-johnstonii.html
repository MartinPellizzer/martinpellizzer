<p>Acalypha johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, colorful flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, and the seeds are small, dry, and winged for easy aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii is a flowering plant native to the island of Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Although it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered and is now known to occur on the nearby island of Palmyra Atoll. It thrives in coastal environments, particularly in sandy soils near the shoreline. The species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 10 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii is a striking tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
