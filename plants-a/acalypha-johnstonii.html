                        <h1>Acalypha johnstonii</h1>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly colored species. The plant is characterized by its showy, spade-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is found in the wet forest habitats of the island of Hawaii, specifically on the Big Island. This plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often associated with montane forests. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha johnstonii was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there accidentally through human activity, such as shipping or travel. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is now found in various habitats across the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
