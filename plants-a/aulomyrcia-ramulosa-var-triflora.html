<p>Aulomyrcia ramulosa var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
