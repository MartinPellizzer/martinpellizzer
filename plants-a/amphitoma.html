<p>Amphitoma, commonly known as the sea snail, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks.</p>
<p>These organisms are characterized by their spiral, calcareous shells that provide protection against predators. Amphitoma species are typically found in shallow coastal waters, where they thrive in sandy or muddy substrates. Their diet mainly consists of algae and detritus, contributing to the ecological balance of their habitat.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in shell morphology and coloration.</p>
