                <h1>Achyroseris bracteosa</h1>
<p>Achyroseris bracteosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, featuring a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions by accessing deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Achyroseris bracteosa is adapted to full sun and is often found in rocky soils or sandy plains.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyroseris bracteosa has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and has a rough, bark-like texture, typically ranging from light green to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and have a tubular structure with five lobes, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris bracteosa is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Sinaloa in Mexico. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including desert scrub and grasslands. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific ecological conditions that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris bracteosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
