<p>Athyrium alpestre subsp.</p>
<p>flexile, commonly known as the flexible lady fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a graceful, arching shape.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
