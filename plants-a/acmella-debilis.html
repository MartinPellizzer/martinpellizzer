                <h1>Acmella debilis</h1>
<p>Acmella debilis, commonly known as the small pink shieldflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, colorful flowers that resemble tiny shields. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique shape.</p>
<p>Acmella debilis is also known for its medicinal properties in some traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered in a rough, grayish bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a distinctive cup-like shape and a central disk, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open, sunny environments. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Acmella debilis is typically found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, moist climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
