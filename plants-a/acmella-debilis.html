                <h1>Acmella debilis</h1>
<p>Acmella debilis, commonly known as the small yellow marshflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Acmella debilis is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a light green bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellow with red centers, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in parts of Brazil, including the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in undergrowth of dense forests. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, the conservation status of Acmella debilis is considered vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis is a tropical flowering plant known for its vibrant orange flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid establishment. The plant has a short growth cycle, typically blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooming are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella debilis offers ecological benefits by supporting a healthy pollinator population and promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its small, colorful flowers and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may have ornamental value in gardens and landscaping. Its role in cultural practices is limited, though it may hold symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored, with more research needed to fully understand its potential industrial or economic contributions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella debilis has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities, with popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Beauty' and 'Orange Flame' being widely cultivated for their vibrant flower colors.</p>
<p>While there are limited naturally occurring hybrids, horticulturists have developed some crosses to enhance traits like flower size and color retention. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and their use in garden landscapes and floral arrangements. Their compact growth habit and long blooming period make them desirable for both container gardening and in-ground planting.</p>
<p>Overall, Acmella debilis contributes to the diversity of ornamental plants in horticultural collections.</p>
