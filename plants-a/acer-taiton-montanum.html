<p>Acer taiton-montanum, commonly known as the Taiton-Montane Maple, is a species of maple native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
