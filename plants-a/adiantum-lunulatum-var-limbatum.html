                    <h1>Adiantum lunulatum var. limbatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum var. limbatum, commonly known as the moonwort fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to the Appalachian region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, crescent-shaped lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
