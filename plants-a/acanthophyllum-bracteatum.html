<p>Acanthophyllum bracteatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its succulent stems and reduced leaves, which help minimize water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
