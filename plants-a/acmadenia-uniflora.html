                <h1>Acmadenia uniflora</h1>
<p>Acmadenia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower acmadenia, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters of one or two. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia uniflora has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are solitary, tubular, and pinkish-red in color, blooming during late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia uniflora is primarily native to southeastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and heathlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is particularly common in the regions of the Australian Capital Territory and the southern parts of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Acmadenia uniflora is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia uniflora was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils. It is often associated with granite outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these states due to its ecological requirements.</p>
