The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and they are covered in a fine layer of trichomes that aid in water absorption. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in the spring or summer.</p>
<p>Aechmea incompta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
