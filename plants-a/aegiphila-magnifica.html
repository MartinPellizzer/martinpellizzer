<p>Aegiphila magnifica, commonly known as the goldenleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila magnifica has compound, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
