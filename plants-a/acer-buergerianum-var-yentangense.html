                <h1>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense, commonly known as the Yentang maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a moderate growth rate.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense has palmately compound leaves that are typically lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn; the leaves are alternate in arrangement and can reach up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to specific areas in this region, its current distribution is even more restricted due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in temperate forest environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas with well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat degradation, Acer buergerianum var. yentangense is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense is a unique maple species known for its striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or perennials can enhance its visual appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. yentangense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
