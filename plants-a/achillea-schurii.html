                <h1>Achillea schurii</h1>
<p>Achillea schurii, commonly known as the Schur's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Achillea schurii is also noted for its resilience and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a grayish-green color, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with fine hairs, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to a height of about 30-60 cm. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and foothills of the state. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with chaparral and scrub habitats. It is also present in parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, flat-topped flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
