                <h1>Achillea schurii</h1>
<p>Achillea schurii, commonly known as Schur's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, and its foliage has a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Achillea schurii is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slender, with a pale green color, and grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, specifically found in regions of the Mediterranean, including Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other parts of the world, particularly in gardens and botanical collections that favor Mediterranean climates. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achillea schurii is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining its vigor. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer. Regular watering is needed during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established, and light fertilization in early spring can promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, and it pairs well with sedums, lavender, and other drought-tolerant plants for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through shared resources. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea schurii contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea schurii is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
