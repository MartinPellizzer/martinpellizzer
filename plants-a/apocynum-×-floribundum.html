                    <h1>Apocynum × floribundum</h1>
<p>Apocynum × floribundum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Apocynum syriacum (white milkweed).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States, characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Apocynum × floribundum plays a role in supporting pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
