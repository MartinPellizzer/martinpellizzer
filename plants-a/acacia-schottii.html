                        <h1>Acacia schottii</h1>
<p>Acacia schottii, commonly known as the Schott's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are a key feature of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional practices by local communities.</p>
