                <h1>Acrophorus diacalpioides</h1>
<p>Acrophorus diacalpioides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing a milky sap, which is the source of its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus diacalpioides has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fleshy outer layer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus diacalpioides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is well adapted to humid and warm climates, thriving in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil. The species is known for its distinctive appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a unique branching pattern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, its natural distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus diacalpioides was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including abandoned agricultural fields and secondary forests. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it has been introduced for reforestation and soil stabilization purposes.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions where it may outcompete native species.</p>
