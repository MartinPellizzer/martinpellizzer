<p>Atriplex flagellaris, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex flagellaris plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
