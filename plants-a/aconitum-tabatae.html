                <h1>Aconitum tabatae</h1>
<p>Aconitum tabatae, commonly known as Tabata's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a deeply lobed structure, and its roots are tuberous, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum tabatae contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tabatae has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in a dense spike, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs and aiding in the plant's survival in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tabatae is primarily native to Nepal.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central Himalayas. This species thrives in moist, temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with rocky slopes and stream banks in these areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized plant within Nepal.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tabatae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and tall, elegant stature. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through its seed pods.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
