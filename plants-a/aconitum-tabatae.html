                    <h1>Aconitum tabatae</h1>
<p>Aconitum tabatae, commonly known as Tabata's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a deeply lobed structure, and its roots are tuberous, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum tabatae contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
