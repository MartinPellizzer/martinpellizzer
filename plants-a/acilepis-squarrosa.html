                <h1>Acilepis squarrosa</h1>
<p>Acilepis squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa acilepis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly appearance, with dense, white, cottony hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acilepis squarrosa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis squarrosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis squarrosa is primarily native to Assam, Cambodia, China South-Central, East Himalaya, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along riverbanks. Acilepis squarrosa is known for its distinctive appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis squarrosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential threat to native ecosystems due to its ability to outcompete local flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to monitor and manage its spread to protect biodiversity.</p>
