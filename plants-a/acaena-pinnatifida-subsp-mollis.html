                <h1>Acaena pinnatifida subsp. mollis</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>mollis, commonly known as the soft burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves that are pinnately lobed.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spiky fruits known as achenes, which are often covered in hooked bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance makes it a notable species in native New Zealand flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>mollis has compound leaves that are pinnatifid, with a serrated or lobed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is erect, often branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and grows in a dense, shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in dense heads, and bloom from late spring to early summer, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a burr-like achene enclosed in a hooked bract, dispersing via attachment to animals, while the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>mollis is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island. Its current distribution includes parts of the North Island as well, though it is less common there compared to its native range.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 100 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>mollis is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand, valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cool climates and requiring a period of dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is only necessary to remove dead or damaged branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native ferns or sedges can enhance its ecological role in a garden setting.</p>
