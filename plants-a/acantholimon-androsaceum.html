                        <h1>Acantholimon androsaceum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon androsaceum, commonly known as the Androsace mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon androsaceum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants that include ferns and their allies, known for their complex vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many desert and succulent species, often with specialized adaptations for arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in arid and coastal regions, known for their often blue or violet flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in rocky and coastal areas, characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon androsaceum, a specific plant species within the genus Acantholimon, known for its distinctive morphology and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon androsaceum is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Kriti, Lebanon-Syria, Transcaucasus, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal habitats. The distribution of Acantholimon androsaceum reflects its adaptation to the diverse climates of the region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon androsaceum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It has also been introduced to other regions for ornamental purposes because of its attractive blue-gray foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
