                    <h1>Adiantum rimicola</h1>
<p>Adiantum rimicola, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adiantum rimicola is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
