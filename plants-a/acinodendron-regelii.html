                <h1>Acinodendron regelii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron regelii, commonly known as the Regel's acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related genera. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically have five petals.</p>
<p>It is adapted to survive in dry environments, often with deep roots to access groundwater.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron regelii has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, typically displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth and slightly woody texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern that becomes more diffuse as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron regelii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found in cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron regelii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape, particularly in fynbos vegetation types. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated and spread beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains a topic of ongoing study.</p>
