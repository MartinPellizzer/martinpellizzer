                    <h1>Artemisia grisea</h1>
<p>Artemisia grisea, commonly known as gray sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia grisea is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
