                <h1>Actinea vaseyi</h1>
<p>Actinea vaseyi, commonly known as the Vanuatu starfish flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that resemble the arms of a starfish, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is known for its delicate, pale yellow to white petals. Actinea vaseyi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea vaseyi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea vaseyi is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically occurring in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky areas across several states. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. Its range includes parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
<p>Actinea vaseyi is often associated with limestone substrates and is considered a rare species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea vaseyi was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky soils along the shoreline, where it benefits from the maritime climate and well-drained conditions. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and has adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several coastal reserves and protected areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species and does not pose a significant threat to native vegetation.</p>
