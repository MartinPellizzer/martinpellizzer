<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has medicinal uses in traditional systems of medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adhatoda odora is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda odora has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age.
