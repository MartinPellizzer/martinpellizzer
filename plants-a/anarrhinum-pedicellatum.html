                    <h1>Anarrhinum pedicellatum</h1>
<p>Anarrhinum pedicellatum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Anarrhinum pedicellatum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
