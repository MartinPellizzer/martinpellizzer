<p>Asplenium capitisyork, commonly known as the "capitulum fern," is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and small, delicate fronds that typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, rounded shape at the base, giving the plant a rosette-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
