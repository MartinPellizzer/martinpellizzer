                <h1>Acer duplicatoserratum</h1>
<p>Acer duplicatoserratum, commonly known as the double-toothed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with double-serrate margins, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 6â€“10 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red to orange-red samaras in the fall.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer duplicatoserratum has palmately compound leaves with a distinctive double-serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10-15 cm in length, with a vibrant green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer duplicatoserratum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests, typically at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Conservation status is critically endangered, as it faces significant threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to protect and propagate this species to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer duplicatoserratum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining desirable traits. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer duplicatoserratum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and supporting a healthy habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer duplicatoserratum is a decorative plant primarily valued for its ornamental uses in horticulture and landscaping due to its distinctive foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves may be occasionally used in traditional herbal teas in certain regions. In terms of medicinal applications, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific evidence remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the economy through the ornamental plant trade and can support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
