                    <h1>Alnus rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus rhombifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, rhomboid-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Alnus rhombifolia plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
