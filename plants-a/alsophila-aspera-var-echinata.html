                    <h1>Alsophila aspera var. echinata</h1>
<p>Alsophila aspera var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a thick, scaly coating. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its robust and upright growth habit makes it well-suited for tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>The spiny texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification.</p>
