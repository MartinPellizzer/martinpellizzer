                    <h1>Atriplex polonica</h1>
<p>Atriplex polonica, commonly known as Polish saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often grayish-green leaves that are adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex polonica is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
