<p>Asplenium malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has a compact, rosette-like appearance with tightly packed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its fronds are usually dark green and can form intricate, delicate clusters.</p>
<p>Asplenium malabaricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
