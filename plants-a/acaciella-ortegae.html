                        <h1>Acaciella ortegae</h1>
<p>Acaciella ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's acaciella, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaciella ortegae is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. This plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Greater Antilles.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaciella ortegae was mainly introduced to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant was introduced by human activity, likely as an ornamental or for erosion control. It has since spread along the shores, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the volcanic islands of the Galápagos archipelago.</p>
