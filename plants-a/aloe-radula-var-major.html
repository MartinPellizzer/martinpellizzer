                    <h1>Aloe radula var. major</h1>
<p>Aloe radula var. major, commonly known as the giant rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-orange flowers, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
