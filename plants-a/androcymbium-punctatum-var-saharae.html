<p>Androcymbium punctatum var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure with a prominent, spurred labellum. The plant typically grows from a compact, corm-like rhizome and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
