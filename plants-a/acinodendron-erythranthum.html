                <h1>Acinodendron erythranthum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron erythranthum, commonly known as the red-flowered acinodendron, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron erythranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron erythranthum has alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron erythranthum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and is commonly associated with secondary growth areas. It thrives in warm, moist environments with partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron erythranthum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is consistent warmth and humidity, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with a subtropical or tropical climate. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and secondary forests, where it can quickly establish itself. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its introduction in several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
