                <h1>Adenocalymma calcareum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma calcareum, commonly known as the limestone adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma calcareum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma calcareum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 2–5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbroken as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months of spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the calcareous soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma calcareum is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí. This plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in semi-arid and tropical environments. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma calcareum was mainly introduced to areas with calcareous soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific soil and climate requirements.</p>
