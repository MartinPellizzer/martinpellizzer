                <h1>Ackama mollis</h1>
<p>Ackama mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Ackama mollis is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama mollis has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, light green bark that develops shallow grooves as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama mollis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats.</p>
<p>Ackama mollis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting biodiversity in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama mollis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and can form dense mats that outcompete native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ability to restore soil fertility in poor, sandy soils.</p>
