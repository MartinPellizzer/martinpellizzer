                <h1>Acianthella macroglossa</h1>
<p>Acianthella macroglossa, commonly known as the large-tongued acianthella, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acianthella macroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthella macroglossa has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white and pinkish color, blooming during spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthella macroglossa is primarily native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores of estuaries and lagoons. This species thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing in dense clusters near the water's edge. It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various coastal wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthella macroglossa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 2000s and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and forested areas. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
