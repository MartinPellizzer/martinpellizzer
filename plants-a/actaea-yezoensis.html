                <h1>Actaea yezoensis</h1>
<p>Actaea yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo Actaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of Hokkaido, Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Actaea yezoensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea yezoensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically 10–20 cm long, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish-purple in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale yellowish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces upright, spiky clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing 1–3 seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals that eat the berries.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea yezoensis is primarily native to the Russian Far East, specifically the Primorsky Krai region.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Japan, including Hokkaido. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. It is commonly found in regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of northeastern China as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea yezoensis was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the United States in the early 20th century, primarily in the northeastern states. The plant has since spread to other regions, including parts of the Pacific Northwest and Canada. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Actaea yezoensis requires careful management to prevent it from outcompeting native species.</p>
