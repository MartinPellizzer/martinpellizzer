                    <h1>Acrostichum sherringii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's holly fern, is a rare and critically endangered fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
