                <h1>Acrostichum sherringii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's holly fern, is a rare and critically endangered fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sherringii has broad, leathery leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses via wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sherringii is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, tropical to subtropical climates, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments, such as understorey layers in dense vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the warm and wet conditions typical of the region's subtropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by contributing to the biodiversity and structure of the understory vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sherringii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in humid forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various organisms. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological imbalances in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has been widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes.</p>
