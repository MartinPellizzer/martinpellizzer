<p>Asplenium baileyanum, commonly known as the Baileys' spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
