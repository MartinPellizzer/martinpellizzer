                    <h1>Aspidium distans var. recurvum</h1>
<p>Aspidium distans var. recurvum, commonly known as the recurved water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive frond morphology.</p>
<p>It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and damp woodlands. The fronds are pinnately compound, with recurved pinnae that give the plant its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
