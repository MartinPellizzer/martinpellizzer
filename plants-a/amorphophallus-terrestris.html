                    <h1>Amorphophallus terrestris</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus terrestris, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a striking, purple-pink spadix surrounded by a white spathe, which resembles a giant, dramatic flower. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The underground corm is edible when properly prepared, though it contains calcium oxalate crystals that can be irritating if not cooked thoroughly.</p>
