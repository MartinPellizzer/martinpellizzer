                    <h1>Antennaria spathulata var. continentis</h1>
<p>Antennaria spathulata var. continentis, commonly known as the continental sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
