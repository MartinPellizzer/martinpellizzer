<p>Achillea sipylea, commonly known as the Sipylean yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea sipylea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sipylea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sipylea is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as coastal cliffs and limestone formations. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean scrublands and maquis vegetation. Its distribution extends to some areas of the Middle East, including western Iran and southern Turkey.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sipylea was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across the United States and Canada. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and is often used in perennial borders and wildflower gardens. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
