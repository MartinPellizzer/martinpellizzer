<p>Apium prostratum subsp.</p>
<p>denticulatum, commonly known as the coastal parsley or sea parsley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to maritime environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
