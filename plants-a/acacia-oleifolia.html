                    <h1>Acacia oleifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia oleifolia, commonly known as the oil acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia oleifolia is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its hard wood and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including fuel and construction.</p>
