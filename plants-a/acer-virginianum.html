<p>Acer virginianum, commonly known as the striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive leaves, which have a yellow-green midrib and are deeply lobed. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that mature in the fall, aiding in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer virginianum is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
