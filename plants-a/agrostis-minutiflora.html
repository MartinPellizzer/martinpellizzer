<p>Agrostis minutiflora, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis minutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
