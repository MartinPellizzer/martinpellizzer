                    <h1>Alisma parnassifolium var. dubium</h1>
<p>Alisma parnassifolium var. dubium, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and stabilize in muddy or aquatic soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Alisma parnassifolium.</p>
