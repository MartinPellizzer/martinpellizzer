                    <h1>Acacia foetida</h1>
<p>Acacia foetida, commonly known as the stinking acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to greenish-gray bark and its distinctive, fragrant or sometimes unpleasant-smelling flowers. The plant produces small, flat seed pods that contain hard, angular seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Acacia foetida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
