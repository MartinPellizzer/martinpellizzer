                <h1>Aconitum mielichhoferi</h1>
<p>Aconitum mielichhoferi, commonly known as the Mielichhofer's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple hood-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 60 to 120 cm, with palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum mielichhoferi has leaves that are compound, with deeply lobed leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, typically measuring up to 30 cm in length, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal and are arranged in racemes; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, aiding in the plant's survival in its alpine habitat.</p>
