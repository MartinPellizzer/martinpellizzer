                <h1>Aconitum cheirophyllum</h1>
<p>Aconitum cheirophyllum, commonly known as the golden aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, which is unusual for the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum cheirophyllum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in racemes, and have five petals with prominent spurs; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cheirophyllum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in meadows, forest margins, and on slopes where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cheirophyllum was mainly introduced to ornamental gardens and botanical collections due to its striking floral display and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its dark blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is typically grown in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to prevent its spread beyond controlled garden environments.</p>
