                    <h1>Aconitum cheirophyllum</h1>
<p>Aconitum cheirophyllum, commonly known as the golden aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, which is unusual for the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.</p>
