                    <h1>Abronia salsa</h1>
<p>Abronia salsa, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Abronia salsa plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
