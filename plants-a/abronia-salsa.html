                        <h1>Abronia salsa</h1>
<p>Abronia salsa, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Abronia salsa plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia salsa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal sand dunes and other sandy habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. It is an important component of the dune ecosystem, providing habitat and stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and development, Abronia salsa is considered threatened in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia salsa was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as beaches, dunes, and roadsides. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been influenced by human activity and natural dispersal mechanisms.</p>
