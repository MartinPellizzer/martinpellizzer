<p>Arabis microphylla var. saximontana, commonly known as the Sierra Point Arabis, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, evergreen leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
