                <h1>Abelia biflora var. coreana</h1>
<p>Abelia biflora var. coreana, commonly known as Korean abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to Korea.</p>
<p>It features oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular white to pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Abelia biflora var. coreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia biflora var. coreana has elliptical to ovate leaves that are glossy dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are clustered in trichas, consisting of five pinkish-white petals and five stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia biflora var. coreana is a rare shrub native to the Korean Peninsula, particularly South Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions in the southern part of the country, where it grows in moist, shaded forest understories. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically found in mountainous areas. This plant is usually found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia biflora var. coreana is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its fragrant white flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in early summer or by layering, which ensures genetic consistency. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during the growing season, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia biflora var. coreana is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering nectar and berries to both wildlife and birds.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
