                <h1>Acrotrema walkeri</h1>
<p>Acrotrema walkeri, commonly known as the coastal rock cress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the rocky coastlines of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acrotrema walkeri plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema walkeri has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers clustered in small inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical dispersal when it bursts open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema walkeri is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in forested areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing on tree trunks or branches. It is a small, epiphytic species that plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the rich biodiversity found in Sri Lanka's natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema walkeri was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often associated with human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions where native vegetation has been disrupted, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and urban environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, particularly in the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
