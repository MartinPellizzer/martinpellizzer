<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>dayuanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems makes it an important component of the region's biodiversity.</p>
