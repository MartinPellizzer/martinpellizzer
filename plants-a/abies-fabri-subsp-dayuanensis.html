                        <h1>Abies fabri subsp. dayuanensis</h1>
<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>dayuanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems makes it an important component of the region's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>dayuanensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. This subspecies is found in high-altitude areas, typically above 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool and moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. The plant is endemic to this region and is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these mountain ranges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>dayuanensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high altitudes, where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mountainous areas of China, particularly in the eastern and central parts of the country.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks. It has also been introduced to other parts of Asia for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its natural range remains largely restricted to its native habitat due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
