                    <h1>Adiantum</h1>
<p>Adiantum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its elegant appearance. Adiantum species are known for their ability to thrive in humid conditions and are popular in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Botanically, they belong to the family Adiantaceae and are distinguished by their lack of a true rhizome and their unique spore-producing structures.</p>
