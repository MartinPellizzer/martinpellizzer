                    <h1>Acacia longifolia var. bylongensis</h1>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. bylongensis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are linear to narrowly elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads during the spring and summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization in ecological restoration projects.</p>
