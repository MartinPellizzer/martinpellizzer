<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena leptacantha var. longissima is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This variety thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in grassy or shrubland habitats. It is commonly associated with the lower South Island, including parts of Marlborough and Otago.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soil conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena leptacantha var. longissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
