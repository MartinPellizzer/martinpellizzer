                <h1>Ackama brassii</h1>
<p>Ackama brassii, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many other spurge species.</p>
<p>Ackama brassii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama brassii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light grayish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern that develops as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a yellowish-white color and a tubular structure that facilitates pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama brassii is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly found in the lowland and mountainous regions of the country. Ackama brassii is part of the Brassicaceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to New Guinea, with limited reports of its presence in nearby islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama brassii was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, particularly in temperate climates. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
