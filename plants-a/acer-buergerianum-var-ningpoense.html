                <h1>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense is a rare maple species native to southern China, particularly in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with most populations found in isolated areas of eastern China. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This variant typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense is a decorative tree known for its vibrant red leaves and compact size, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages air circulation. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is occasionally used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The wood of this plant has minimal industrial applications due to its softness and scarcity. Culturally, it is not widely symbolized but is appreciated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation also contributes to its importance in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense has several popular cultivars, including 'Sango-keiki' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to produce ornamental varieties with unique leaf colors and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and improved disease resistance, making them more suitable for a wider range of climates. Horticulturally, this species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to landscape design and botanical gardens worldwide.</p>
