                        <h1>Abutilon muticum</h1>
<p>Abutilon muticum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Abutilon muticum is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in less-than-ideal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon muticum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This species thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often associated with coastal areas. It is also known to grow in disturbed soils and can be found in swampy regions throughout the Atlantic coastal plain.</p>
<p>Abutilon muticum is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon muticum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal areas. It is now considered a potential weed in some parts of the country.</p>
<p>Its spread is limited by its preference for specific soil and climate conditions.</p>
