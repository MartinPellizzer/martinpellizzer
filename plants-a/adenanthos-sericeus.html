                <h1>Adenanthos sericeus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos sericeus, commonly known as the silky adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its soft, silvery foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in clusters during spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Adenanthos sericeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos sericeus has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside due to a dense covering of fine hairs, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered in a soft, woolly texture, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in dense umbels, displaying a pale yellow to cream color, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos sericeus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and nearby mainland areas of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with heathlands and coastal dunes. It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is known for its distinctive silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>Adenanthos sericeus is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos sericeus was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, heathlands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of New Zealand and the United Kingdom, often as an ornamental species. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
