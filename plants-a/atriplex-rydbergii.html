<p>Atriplex rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Atriplex rydbergii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
