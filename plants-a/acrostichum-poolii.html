                <h1>Acrostichum poolii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum poolii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that help in capturing sunlight and facilitating gas exchange.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum poolii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 30â€“60 cm long, with lance-shaped leaflets and a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum poolii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or wetland habitats where it can access the abundant water it requires. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>
<p>Acrostichum poolii is not found in temperate or arid regions, highlighting its strong adaptation to tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum poolii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its large, feathery fronds. This plant thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in swampy areas or near water bodies. Its introduction has led to its establishment in wetlands, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
