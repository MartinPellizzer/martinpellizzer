<p>Acrostichum poolii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that help in capturing sunlight and facilitating gas exchange.</p>
