<p>Acacia latronum, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia latronum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia latronum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central and western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as the Great Sandy Desert, the Simpson Desert, and parts of the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen growing along sand dunes and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Acacia latronum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
