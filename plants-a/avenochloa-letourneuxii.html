<p>Avenochloa letourneuxii, commonly known as the African ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
