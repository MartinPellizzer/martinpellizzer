<p>Alsophila heteromorpha var. decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often fragmented fronds that give it a distinctive, almost decayed appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in shape and size.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
