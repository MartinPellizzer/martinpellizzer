                <h1>Adinandra merrillii</h1>
<p>Adinandra merrillii, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, while its small, fragrant flowers are usually yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>Adinandra merrillii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra merrillii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra merrillii is primarily native to the islands of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland tropical rainforests of these regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adinandra merrillii is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra merrillii was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it suitable for understory growth in forests. The plant is often found in regions with a warm climate and moderate rainfall throughout the year. Its introduction has been documented in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections in other parts of the world.</p>
