<p>Axonopus carinatovaginatus var. sprucei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved axonopus, is a grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
