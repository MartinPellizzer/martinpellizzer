<p>Artemisia spicata subsp.</p>
<p>eriantha, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on dry slopes and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its aromatic compounds make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
