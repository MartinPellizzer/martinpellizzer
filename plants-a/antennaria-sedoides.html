                    <h1>Antennaria sedoides</h1>
<p>Antennaria sedoides, commonly known as the stickyweed or yellow sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Antennaria sedoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods.</p>
