                    <h1>Alisma parnassifolium f. dubium</h1>
<p>Alisma parnassifolium f. dubium, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a rare variant of the water plantain species native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in moist soils.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
