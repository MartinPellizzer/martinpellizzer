                <h1>Acer davidii subsp. grosseri</h1>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri has palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to broadly ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and can reach up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often found in shaded, temperate climates. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, it is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with companion plants like conifers or perennials for aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri is a deciduous shrub or small tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, especially on slopes and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse array of life forms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional medicine for its leaves, which may have anti-inflammatory properties. Its wood, though not widely used industrially, can be crafted into small items due to its fine grain and workability.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions of its native habitat, representing resilience and natural beauty. While not economically significant on a large scale, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental appeal also makes it a potential candidate for horticultural use in specific garden settings.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii subsp.</p>
<p>grosseri has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Variegatum' and 'Pendulum', which showcase striking foliage and unique growth habits. It is also involved in the creation of several hybrids, such as with Acer pictum and Acer griseum, resulting in plants with enhanced cold hardiness and varied leaf colors.</p>
<p>These hybrids and cultivars are particularly valuable in horticulture for their ability to thrive in different climates and their aesthetic appeal. The species plays a significant role in landscape design due to its adaptability and visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance continues to grow as gardeners seek plants with both beauty and resilience.</p>
