                        <h1>Acaena nivalis</h1>
<p>Acaena nivalis, commonly known as the snowflax, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has compound leaves with stiff, bristle-like tips, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are encased in a prickly, spiky fruit known as an achene, typical of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Acaena nivalis is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky soils and mountainous areas.</p>
