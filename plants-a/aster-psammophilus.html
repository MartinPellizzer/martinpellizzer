                    <h1>Aster psammophilus</h1>
<p>Aster psammophilus, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments where it adapts to extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aster psammophilus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
