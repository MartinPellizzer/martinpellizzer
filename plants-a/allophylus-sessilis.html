<p>Allophylus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile-leaf alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Allophylus sessilis has a compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
