                    <h1>Artemisia saurensis</h1>
<p>Artemisia saurensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert wormwood, is a hardy shrub native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a distinct aromatic quality and making it useful in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Artemisia saurensis is adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in well-drained sandy soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
