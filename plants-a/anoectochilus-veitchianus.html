<p>Anoectochilus veitchianus, commonly known as the Veitch's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Anoectochilus veitchianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements.</p>
