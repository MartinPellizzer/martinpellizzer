                <h1>Acer pectinatum subsp. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its striking ornamental value, featuring palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Its small, pendulous flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. Its current distribution is limited to specific areas in central and southern Taiwan, where it grows in moist, shaded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mixed evergreen forests. This subspecies is found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red and orange foliage, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy and ensure successful germination. This species grows best in temperate climates, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of fauna and flora.</p>
