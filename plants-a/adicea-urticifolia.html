                <h1>Adicea urticifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and serrated leaves that often have stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as fields and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adicea urticifolia is known for its defensive mechanisms, including the release of irritant chemicals from its leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea urticifolia has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–6 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are hairy and reddish-brown, with a somewhat woody texture, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturing.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea urticifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments within forests. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with understory vegetation. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Adicea urticifolia is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea urticifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland and riparian areas. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
