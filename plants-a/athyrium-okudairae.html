                    <h1>Athyrium okudairae</h1>
<p>Athyrium okudairae, commonly known as the Okudaira's lady fern, is a species of fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
