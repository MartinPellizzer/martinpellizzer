                <h1>Achillea alpina subsp. camtschatica</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear a dense arrangement of small, pale yellow to white flower heads.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, often with a grayish-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, commonly found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray hue due to dense trichomes. The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray flowers, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in its ability to thrive in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia. It is now found across a broader range, including parts of Central Asia and the European Alps.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
