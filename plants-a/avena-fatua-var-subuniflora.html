                    <h1>Avena fatua var. subuniflora</h1>
<p>Avena fatua var. subuniflora, commonly known as the slender wild oat, is a variant of the wild oat species characterized by its reduced inflorescence structure.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are smaller and more closely spaced than in the typical wild oat. Its seeds are small, oval, and have a distinctive hilum, making them identifiable under a microscope.</p>
<p>This variant is often considered a weed in cultivated crops due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
