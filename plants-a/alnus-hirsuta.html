<p>Alnus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually hairy or pubescent, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Alnus hirsuta is often found in moist, nitrogen-poor soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance makes it a valuable species in reforestation and wetland restoration projects.</p>
