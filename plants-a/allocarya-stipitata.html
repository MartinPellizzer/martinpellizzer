<p>Allocarya stipitata, commonly known as the sticky cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of short, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment.</p>
<p>Allocarya stipitata is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
