                <h1>Adiantum rhomboideum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhombic maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum rhomboideum is valued for its elegant foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhomboideum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a rhomboid or diamond-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a delicate, feathery texture, and can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and green, growing from a rhizome, and does not have true bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, with a short blooming period in the spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhomboideum is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its native range includes states like Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is often associated with forested habitats and is considered an indicator species for mature, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhomboideum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in the United States as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens, greenhouses, and along roadsides where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant has been introduced in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington, where it has established populations in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through spores make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
