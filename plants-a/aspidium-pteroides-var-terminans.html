<p>Aspidium pteroides var. terminans, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce erect, lanceolate fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>
