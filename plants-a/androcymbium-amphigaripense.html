<p>Androcymbium amphigaripense, commonly known as the Indian orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its small, strap-shaped leaves are adapted to conserve water, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
