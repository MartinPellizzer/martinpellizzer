                    <h1>Atriplex parishii var. persistens</h1>
<p>Atriplex parishii var. persistens, commonly known as the persistent saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to desert and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
