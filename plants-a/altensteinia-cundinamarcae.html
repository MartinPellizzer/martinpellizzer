                    <h1>Altensteinia cundinamarcae</h1>
<p>Altensteinia cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America, particularly Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Altensteinia cundinamarcae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
