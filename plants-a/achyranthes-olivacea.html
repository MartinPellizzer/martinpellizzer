                <h1>Achyranthes olivacea</h1>
<p>Achyranthes olivacea, commonly known as the oliveleaf sida, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin and a rough texture.</p>
<p>Achyranthes olivacea is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes olivacea has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes olivacea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a warm, humid climate. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes olivacea was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a forage plant in arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its introduced range. The plant thrives in dry to semi-arid climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries in Africa and parts of Asia where it has become naturalized.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains under investigation in many regions.</p>
