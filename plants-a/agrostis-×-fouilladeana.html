                    <h1>Agrostis × fouilladeana</h1>
<p>Agrostis × fouilladeana, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, diploid hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, particularly in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying hybridization and genetic diversity in grasses.</p>
