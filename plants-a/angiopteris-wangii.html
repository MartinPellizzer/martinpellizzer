<p>Angiopteris wangii, commonly known as the Wang's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive pinnate structure with a long, creeping rhizome that helps it spread across moist environments. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions, often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
