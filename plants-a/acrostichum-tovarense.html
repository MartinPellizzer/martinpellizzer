                <h1>Acrostichum tovarense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tovarense, commonly known as the Tovarense fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, adding to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tovarense has leaves that are broad, lanceolate in shape, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 20 to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains thin throughout its growth. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersing its seeds by wind, and the plant has fibrous, rhizomatous roots that spread horizontally just below the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tovarense is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. It thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with tidal zones. Acrostichum tovarense is also present in some regions of South America, particularly in northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific tropical and subtropical coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tovarense was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and has been reported in both natural and anthropogenic environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range in some regions.</p>
