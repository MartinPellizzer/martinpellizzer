                <h1>Actinidia melliana</h1>
<p>Actinidia melliana, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, which are edible but often bitter. Actinidia melliana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia melliana has heart-shaped leaves that are medium in size, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, containing small seeds dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia melliana is primarily native to China Southeast, Hainan, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in humid and temperate climates. It is commonly associated with forested environments, often growing along stream banks or in shaded undergrowth. The plant is known for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world for cultivation.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of Southeast China and neighboring regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia melliana was mainly introduced to North America and Europe during the late 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fruit.</p>
<p>It has since been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, particularly in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact and management strategies.</p>
