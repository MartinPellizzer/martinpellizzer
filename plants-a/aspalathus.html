<p>Aspalathus, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces flowers that range from yellow to red in color. The plant is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is drought-resistant. Its most notable feature is the unique red-brown tea made from its leaves, which is caffeine-free and rich in antioxidants.</p>
<p>Aspalathus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional African medicine.</p>
