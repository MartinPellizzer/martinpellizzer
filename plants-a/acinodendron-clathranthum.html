                <h1>Acinodendron clathranthum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron clathranthum, commonly known as the coralwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences that resemble coral-like structures. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acinodendron clathranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron clathranthum has compound, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron clathranthum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found growing near the forest floor.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic locations within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron clathranthum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since been found in various locations across the region. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. It often competes with native vegetation, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further colonization of new habitats.</p>
