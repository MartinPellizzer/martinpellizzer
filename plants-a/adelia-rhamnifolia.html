                <h1>Adelia rhamnifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia rhamnifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, dark purple berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>Adelia rhamnifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia rhamnifolia has alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a spreading shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellowish-white petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia rhamnifolia is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils within woodlands and open forests. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas where it forms part of the local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively uncommon and is considered a species of conservation interest in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia rhamnifolia was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is known for its small, clustered flowers and its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to its adaptability and ease of propagation.</p>
