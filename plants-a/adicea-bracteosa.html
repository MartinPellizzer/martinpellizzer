                <h1>Adicea bracteosa</h1>
<p>Adicea bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adicea bracteosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea bracteosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that is slightly rough to the touch, and it grows in a trailing or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea bracteosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in association with other understory vegetation. It is also occasionally reported in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Adicea bracteosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea bracteosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions has contributed to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
