                <h1>Acrostichum semipinnatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatum has large, feather-like leaves that are semi-pinnate, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping habit. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and wetlands where it thrives in saline and brackish environments. This plant is also present in the Caribbean and some regions of southern Florida. It prefers humid climates with well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the southeastern United States to northern Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in wetlands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and low-lying areas with high moisture levels. This plant is often associated with human-altered environments such as landfills, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>It can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.</p>
