                <h1>Adriana billardierei</h1>
<p>Adriana billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Adriana billardierei is a low-growing shrub that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adriana billardierei has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth, glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that turns greyish-brown with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana billardierei is primarily native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, particularly in South Australia and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often in heathlands and open woodlands. This species is adapted to the dry, salty conditions of the coastal environment. It thrives in areas with moderate to high exposure to sea breezes and is often seen growing in dunes or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana billardierei was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since spread to various regions across the country. The plant thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments, often colonizing disturbed soils and rocky areas. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, raising concerns among land managers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now considered widespread along the west coast of the North Island.</p>
