                <h1>Aegilops exaltata</h1>
<p>Aegilops exaltata, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Aegilops exaltata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in agricultural improvement due to its genetic relationship with wheat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops exaltata has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly upright. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
