                <h1>Aegiphila triflora</h1>
<p>Aegiphila triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered aegiphila, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila triflora has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged oppositely along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that has a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a distinctive tubular shape, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>
