                <h1>Adenia apiculata</h1>
<p>Adenia apiculata, commonly known as the horned mountain apple, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, horn-like structures on its stems. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Adenia apiculata is often found in rocky or limestone soils in dry, open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia apiculata has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-15 cm long and 2-6 cm wide, arranged spirally along the stem. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows as an erect shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal umbels, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, dispersed primarily by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia apiculata is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in subtropical and tropical rainforest environments. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within these regions. It is often associated with coastal and lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Adenia apiculata is also present in some parts of northern New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia apiculata was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has been reported in areas such as Queensland and New South Wales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along the forest floor. It is often found in subtropical and tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
