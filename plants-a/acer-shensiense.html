                <h1>Acer shensiense</h1>
<p>Acer shensiense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, particularly in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern and eastern China, as well as regions in Korea and Japan. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in well-drained soils within forested areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer shensiense is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer shensiense includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late spring to early summer, and dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its roots help prevent erosion by holding soil in place, especially on slopes and in degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer shensiense plays a role in improving soil quality by supporting a diverse range of microbial life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it is not a major commercial crop. Culturally, it is valued in Chinese horticulture for its aesthetic appeal, often planted in gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty, reflecting the deep connection between nature and human culture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense has several popular cultivars such as 'Red Prince,' 'Crimson King,' and 'Crimson Queen,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with improved traits like cold hardiness and foliage color. Hybrids involving Acer shensiense often combine its ornamental qualities with the resilience of other maple species. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance, especially in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Their adaptability to various climates makes them valuable additions to both public and private gardens.</p>
