                <h1>Acer shensiense</h1>
<p>Acer shensiense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters and has a spreading, rounded canopy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in upright clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a deciduous tree native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes both wild populations and cultivated specimens, particularly in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer shensiense is considered a species of concern and is listed as near threatened by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in the spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shensiense is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have limited use in traditional herbal remedies.
