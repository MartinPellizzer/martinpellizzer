<p>Anatropa tenella, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its stems are flexible and can float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Anatropa tenella is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
