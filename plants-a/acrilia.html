<p>Acrilia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are known to have medicinal properties, used in traditional remedies for their anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
