<p>Aspidium decompositum var. tenerum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form tenerum is distinguished by its more compact growth and softer foliage compared to the typical variety.</p>
