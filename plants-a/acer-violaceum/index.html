                            <h1>Acer Violaceum</h1>
<p>Purple maple, scientifically known as Acer violaceum, is a strikingly beautiful tree native to the northeastern United States. Its most notable feature is its vibrant purple foliage, which turns a brilliant red in the fall. This deciduous tree typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 feet and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. While it is not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, the purple maple is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
