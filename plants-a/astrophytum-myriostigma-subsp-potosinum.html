<p>Astrophytum myriostigma subsp.</p>
<p>potosinum, commonly known as the Potos√≠ globose cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem covered in white, radial spines and a dense coating of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
