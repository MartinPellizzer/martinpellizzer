<p>Asplenium celtibericum subsp.</p>
<p>molinae, commonly known as the Molina's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, humid environments such as cliffs or walls.</p>
<p>The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape and serrated margins. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological preferences and limited distribution.</p>
