<p>Asplenium ballivianii, commonly known as the Bolivian maidenhair fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and extensively branched, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Asplenium ballivianii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
