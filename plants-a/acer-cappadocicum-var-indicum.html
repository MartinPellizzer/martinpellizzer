                        <h1>Acer cappadocicum var. indicum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. indicum is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>This variant of the maple tree is commonly found in the temperate forests and mountainous areas of these regions. It thrives in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant is adapted to the humid and cool climate conditions typical of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in association with other subtropical and temperate forest species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. indicum was mainly introduced to specific regions in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred during the 19th and early 20th centuries as part of broader efforts to diversify native plant landscapes. It has since become established in certain areas, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited to specific ecological niches where it can thrive.</p>
