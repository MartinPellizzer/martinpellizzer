<p>Acacia seyal var. fistula, commonly known as the pale acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, yellow to brown stipules and its narrow, green, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds.
