<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>californicum, commonly known as the California boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the common boxelder but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different leaf structure.</p>
