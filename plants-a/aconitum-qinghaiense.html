                <h1>Aconitum qinghaiense</h1>
<p>Aconitum qinghaiense, commonly known as the Qinghai aconite, is a perennial herb native to the Qinghai region of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces egg-shaped, woolly capsules containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum qinghaiense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in tall, spire-like inflorescences, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two showy, spurred petals; they bloom in summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients in its native alpine environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum qinghaiense is primarily native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, specifically in the high-altitude regions of Qinghai Province and adjacent areas of Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level. This species is adapted to the cold, arid conditions typical of its native habitat. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum qinghaiense was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high altitudes, particularly in mountainous areas of China.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for alpine and subalpine environments. This plant is often found in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding regions, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. Its introduction to these areas has been largely due to its ecological significance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in new habitats.</p>
