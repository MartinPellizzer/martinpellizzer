<p>Agapetes pseudogriffithii var. abbayana, commonly known as the Abbayan silverleaf, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India.</p>
<p>It is a evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it benefits from the high humidity and shade. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a silvery underside, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
