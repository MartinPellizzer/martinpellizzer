                    <h1>Atriplex macrodira</h1>
<p>Atriplex macrodira, commonly known as the broad-leaved saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex macrodira plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
