                    <h1>Atriplex parishii var. subtilis</h1>
<p>Atriplex parishii var. subtilis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
