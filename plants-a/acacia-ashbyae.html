                        <h1>Acacia ashbyae</h1>
<p>Acacia ashbyae, commonly known as Ashby's wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia ashbyae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
