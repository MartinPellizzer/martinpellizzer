                <h1>Adicea astrogramma</h1>
<p>Adicea astrogramma, commonly known as the star-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its stems are typically hairy and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across vegetation.</p>
<p>Adicea astrogramma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea astrogramma has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea astrogramma is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea astrogramma was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native range. The plant's spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and urban environments. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in areas where it has been intentionally or unintentionally planted.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
