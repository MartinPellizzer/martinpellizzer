                <h1>Adenophyllum aurantium</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum aurantium, commonly known as the golden cup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum aurantium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum aurantium has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture, ranging in size from 3 to 7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum aurantium is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested habitats. Adenophyllum aurantium is often associated with humid climates and is part of the native flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific areas within Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum aurantium was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize slopes in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its bright yellow flowers attracting pollinators. However, its aggressive growth can lead to the displacement of native species in some regions.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in several areas where it has spread beyond its intended use.</p>
