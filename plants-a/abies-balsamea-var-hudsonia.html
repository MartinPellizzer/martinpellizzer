                    <h1>Abies balsamea var. hudsonia</h1>
<p>Abies balsamea var. hudsonia, commonly known as Hudson's fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical balsam fir. The plant produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in forest ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.</p>
