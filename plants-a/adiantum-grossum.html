                <h1>Adiantum grossum</h1>
<p>Adiantum grossum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum grossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum grossum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, pinnately arranged, and typically have a dark green color with a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 10â€“30 cm long and have a delicate, leathery texture. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light brown bark that grows from the base and branches sparingly. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, spore-bearing capsule that releases spores through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum grossum is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the country's tropical and subtropical regions. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in humid mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is closely tied to the diverse ecosystems of Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum grossum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Adiantum grossum is considered an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic value and ease of care.</p>
