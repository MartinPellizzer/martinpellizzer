                        <h1>Abies pinsapo subsp. numidica</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>numidica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky, mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>numidica is primarily native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, specifically spanning parts of Morocco and Algeria. This subspecies thrives in the mountainous regions characterized by a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where it grows in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the region, including periodic droughts and temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>numidica was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate elevations, typically between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often planted in urban landscapes and as ornamental trees due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage. However, it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native range in North Africa.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been limited to specific horticultural and landscaping purposes in regions where it can adapt to local conditions.</p>
