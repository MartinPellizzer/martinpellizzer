<p>Athyrium × bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>shiibaense, commonly known as the Shiibaense Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are typically variegated with white and green hues.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, turning bronze in autumn before shedding, making it a seasonal ornamental plant.</p>
