                    <h1>Apicra deltoidea var. turgida</h1>
<p>Apicra deltoidea var. turgida, commonly known as the waxy leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas like roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
