                <h1>Acnistus fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Acnistus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the spring. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus fasciculatus has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, and varying in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green to yellowish color, growing in a prostrate or ascending manner. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with the seeds being small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus fasciculatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and Southeast Asia. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense undergrowth or along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to a wide range of climatic conditions within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus fasciculatus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological and economic impacts in certain areas.</p>
