<p>Appendicula infundibuliformis, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant's leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. It produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
