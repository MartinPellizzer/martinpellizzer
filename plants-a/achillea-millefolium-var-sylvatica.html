<p>Achillea millefolium var. sylvatica, commonly known as woodland yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from early summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. sylvatica has compound, feather-like leaves that are finely divided, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. sylvatica is a variant of the common yarrow that is native to Europe, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of Asia and North America, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is generally stable, though it may face threats from habitat loss and climate change in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. sylvatica is a hardy perennial known for its fern-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back, though it often reseed itself for continued growth.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
