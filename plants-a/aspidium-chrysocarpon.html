<p>Aspidium chrysocarpon, commonly known as the golden-fruited water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks, where it can maintain the high humidity it requires.</p>
<p>Aspidium chrysocarpon is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
