                <h1>Acrostichum frigidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum frigidum, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of fern native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Acrostichum frigidum plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its harsh environment, providing habitat and food for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum frigidum has large, broad, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum frigidum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern and eastern Australia, including the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in salt marshes, tidal flats, and other brackish water environments. This plant thrives in areas with high salinity and is often associated with estuaries and lagoons. It is well adapted to the harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Acrostichum frigidum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum frigidum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional planting for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with moist, shaded habitats, often near water bodies or in disturbed areas. The plant's ability to thrive in these conditions has allowed it to spread beyond its native range. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and adaptability.</p>
