<p>Acanthus spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, spiny bracts that enclose clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its robust growth habit makes it suitable for use in gardens and as a decorative plant in containers.</p>
<p>Acanthus spinosissimus is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions.</p>
