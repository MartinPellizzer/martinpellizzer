                <h1>Adinandra acutifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible.</p>
<p>Adinandra acutifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra acutifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra acutifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland forests, often growing on rocky or disturbed soils. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of suitable microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra acutifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in forested habitats and is often found in secondary growth areas. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
