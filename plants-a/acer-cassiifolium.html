                    <h1>Acer cassiifolium</h1>
<p>Acer cassiifolium, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta.</p>
