                    <h1>Artemisia smithii</h1>
<p>Artemisia smithii, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia smithii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
