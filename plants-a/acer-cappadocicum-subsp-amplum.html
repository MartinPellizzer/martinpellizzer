                <h1>Acer cappadocicum subsp. amplum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad, spreading shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 12 cm in diameter, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in inflorescences, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light, aiding in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a rare maple species native to the high mountains of Turkey, specifically the Taurus and Pontic ranges. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these regions, though it has been introduced to some botanical gardens and collections.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The tree follows a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during its establishment phase, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been historically valued in folk medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it grows, often representing resilience and natural heritage.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation efforts highlights its importance in maintaining ecosystem stability and genetic diversity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>amplum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique leaf patterns and autumn color, with popular selections including 'Variegatum' and 'Pendulum'. These cultivars are often used in ornamental horticulture for their visual appeal.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this species are less common but can be found in some specialized collections, typically bred for enhanced growth habits or color. The species holds horticultural importance due to its ability to thrive in diverse conditions and its aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of maple trees in landscaping and botanical gardens.</p>
