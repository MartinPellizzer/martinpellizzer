<p>Abronia carterae, commonly known as Carter's bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Abronia carterae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms.</p>
