<p>Acicarpha spathulata var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, acicular leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
