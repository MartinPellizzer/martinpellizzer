                    <h1>Agrostis exarata var. monolepis</h1>
<p>Agrostis exarata var. monolepis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass.</p>
