                <h1>Achnatherum aridum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum aridum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
<p>Achnatherum aridum is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum aridum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, slightly folded, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green, with a smooth texture and can vary in length from 5 to 20 centimeters. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish or bluish color, and grows upright with a clump-forming habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers that bloom in early summer, and they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-sided spikelet containing small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to survive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum aridum is primarily native to regions of Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and parts of southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as steppes and sandy soils. This plant thrives in areas with low precipitation and high temperatures, often growing in open grasslands. Its distribution extends into northern China, particularly in the Xinjiang region.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum aridum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in dry, sandy, or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the western United States, parts of Canada, and northern Mexico. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites, including roadsides, fields, and areas with low vegetation cover. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activity, such as agricultural expansion and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common component of the plant community in these environments.</p>
