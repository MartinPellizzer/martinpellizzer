<p>Achnatherum aridum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
<p>Achnatherum aridum is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
