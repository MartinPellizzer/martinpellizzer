                <h1>Adiantum malaliense</h1>
<p>Adiantum malaliense, commonly known as the Malali maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum malaliense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum malaliense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 20 cm in length, and have a dark green color with a silvery underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. This species does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing plant, and it does not have fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum malaliense is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland rainforests and mountainous areas of these countries. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and stream banks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum malaliense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often seen in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
