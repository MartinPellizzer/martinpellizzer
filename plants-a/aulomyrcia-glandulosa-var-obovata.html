<p>Aulomyrcia glandulosa var. obovata, commonly known as the glandular obovate aulomyrcia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its obovate, glandular-stipitate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinct waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the summer months. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
