                <h1>Adicea clandestina</h1>
<p>Adicea clandestina, commonly known as the secret adicea, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to bright orange. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a velvety texture. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adicea clandestina is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea clandestina has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a climbing habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea clandestina is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant is commonly found in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing near stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of West and Central Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea clandestina was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is reduced. This plant is commonly found along roadsides, in urban areas, and near construction sites. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented.</p>
