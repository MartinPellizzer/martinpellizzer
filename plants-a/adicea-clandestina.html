<p>Adicea clandestina, commonly known as the secret adicea, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to bright orange. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a velvety texture. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adicea clandestina is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
