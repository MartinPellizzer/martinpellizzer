                <h1>Aconitum fangianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum fangianum, commonly known as Fang's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are compound, with palmate divisions, and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum fangianum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum fangianum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 15 to 30 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a single, vertical direction. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant, with a spurred petal structure, and they bloom in late summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fangianum is primarily native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas, specifically in regions of Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and forest clearings. This species is often found at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones due to its sensitivity to temperature and soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the alpine flora in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fangianum was mainly introduced to specific regions of China, particularly in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with rocky or forested habitats where it can thrive in partial shade. Its introduction to these areas is largely due to its ornamental value and traditional medicinal use.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
