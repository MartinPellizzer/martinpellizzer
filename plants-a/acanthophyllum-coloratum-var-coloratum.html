                        <h1>Acanthophyllum coloratum var. coloratum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum coloratum var. coloratum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and succulent leaves that store water.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
