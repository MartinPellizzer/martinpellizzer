                    <h1>Arisaema consanguineum f. alpestre</h1>
<p>Arisaema consanguineum f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine arrowhead, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, fleshy spadix that bears tiny, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Arisaema consanguineum.</p>
