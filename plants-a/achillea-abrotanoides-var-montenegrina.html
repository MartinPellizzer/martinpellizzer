                <h1>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina</h1>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina, commonly known as Montenegro yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of silver-green, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that typically occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are grey-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the plant has a fibrous root system that spreads horizontally near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly Montenegro and parts of Albania.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It prefers sunny, open habitats such as meadows, slopes, and forest edges at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant, yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in the winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina is a valuable plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also serves as a source of food and shelter for various insects and small wildlife. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of Mediterranean and alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea abrotanoides var. montenegrina is a lesser-known plant with limited culinary use, though it may be occasionally used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
