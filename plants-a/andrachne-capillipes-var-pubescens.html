                    <h1>Andrachne capillipes var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Andrachne capillipes var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, fleshy leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are yellowish-green with five petals and are borne in clusters, often appearing in late spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in disturbed or open environments.</p>
