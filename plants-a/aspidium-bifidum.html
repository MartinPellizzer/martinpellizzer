<p>Aspidium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two parts, giving it its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Aspidium bifidum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
