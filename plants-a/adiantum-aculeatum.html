                <h1>Adiantum aculeatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum aculeatum, commonly known as the needle-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
<p>Adiantum aculeatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum aculeatum has frond-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green, with a slender, wiry texture, and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, upright stem with smooth, light green bark that grows from the base upward. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit develops into a cluster of dark brown, spore-bearing capsules.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aculeatum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen in woodlands with rich, organic soil. It is also present in some regions of Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aculeatum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. The introduction has led to its establishment in various regions, especially in moist, shaded environments. Despite its ornamental value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the ecological impacts of non-native plant species.</p>
