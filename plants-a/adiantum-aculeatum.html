<p>Adiantum aculeatum, commonly known as the needle-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
<p>Adiantum aculeatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
