                <h1>Adonanthe pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Adonanthe pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact rosette of silver-green leaves and produces delicate blue or violet flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe pyrenaica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a pale yellow color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe pyrenaica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and limestone outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is also present in some areas of southwestern France and the Balearic Islands. It prefers sunny exposures and is often seen growing in open, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe pyrenaica was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in regions such as Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires moderate moisture levels. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive tendencies.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
