<p>Allium madidum, commonly known as the wetland garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and develops bulbous structures similar to onions, though they are not typically edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Allium madidum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
