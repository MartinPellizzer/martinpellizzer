                <h1>Acer hyrcanum subsp. hyrcanum</h1>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests and along river valleys.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad, heart-shaped base, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length, turning yellow to orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and exhibits a fast-growing pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellow-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid environments where the plant is commonly found.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a rare tree species native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and southern Kazakhstan. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in the Kopet Dag and surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky environments with well-drained soils, typically found in steppe and semi-desert zones. This species grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia, known for its striking red autumn foliage. It can be propagated through seed or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter, making it suitable for temperate climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth in xeriscaped gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing biodiversity in its surroundings. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting local ecosystems and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>
