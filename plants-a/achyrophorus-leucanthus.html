                <h1>Achyrophorus leucanthus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the lichenized fungi group.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to thrive in various environments. This lichen typically grows on rocks, trees, and soil, and is often found in temperate and boreal regions. Its white or pale-colored apothecia are distinctive features that aid in its identification.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental health and its ecological importance in nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus leucanthus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its growth in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus leucanthus is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly the Appalachian Mountains region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich, acidic soils and high humidity. It is often associated with mature hardwood forests and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it has become increasingly rare in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus leucanthus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
