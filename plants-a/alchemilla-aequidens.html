                    <h1>Alchemilla aequidens</h1>
<p>Alchemilla aequidens, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
