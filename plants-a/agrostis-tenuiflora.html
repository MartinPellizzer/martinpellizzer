                    <h1>Agrostis tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on lawns, golf courses, and moist soils, often thriving in shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in turfgrass systems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
