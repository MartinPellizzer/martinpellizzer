                    <h1>Athyrium biondii</h1>
<p>Athyrium biondii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
