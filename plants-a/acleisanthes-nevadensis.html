                <h1>Acleisanthes nevadensis</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra whiteflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and open woodlands, often at high elevations. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>Acleisanthes nevadensis is a rare and endangered species, with limited geographic distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes nevadensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and somewhat branched, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink to reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes nevadensis is primarily native to Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the deserts and arid regions of these western U.S. states. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often seen in areas with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes nevadensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun, typically in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is often seen in urban and suburban landscapes due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It thrives in environments with moderate to high temperatures and low humidity.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
