                    <h1>Amsinckia conica</h1>
<p>Amsinckia conica, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has hairy leaves that are often gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces elongated, seed-bearing structures called siliques, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Amsinckia conica is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
