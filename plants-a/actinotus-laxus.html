                <h1>Actinotus laxus</h1>
<p>Actinotus laxus, commonly known as the silver fern, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Actinotus laxus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus laxus has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it grows in a sprawling or climbing habit. The flowers are delicate, star-shaped, and white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus laxus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and south-western regions of the state. This plant typically grows in heathlands and dry grasslands. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Western Australia, where it thrives in coastal and inland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus laxus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in native gardens and cultivated landscapes in New Zealand, where it has been widely adopted for its ornamental value. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in rock gardens and borders. Its delicate, pinkish-white flowers appear in late winter to early spring, adding a unique touch to the landscape.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Actinotus laxus is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
