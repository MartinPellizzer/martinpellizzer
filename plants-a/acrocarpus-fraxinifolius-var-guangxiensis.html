                <h1>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi acrocarpus, is a deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows primarily as a single trunk with minimal branching. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis is a variant of the native tree species found primarily in Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Vietnam, and Laos.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is mainly restricted to the Guangxi region in southern China, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within lowland and hillside forests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis is a fast-growing evergreen tree commonly propagated through seed sowing or cuttings.</p>
<p>It exhibits a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 5–7 years under optimal conditions. This species thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and annual pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with nitrogen-fixing legumes to enhance soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis is an important plant in tropical and subtropical ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the area. This species acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, but it is primarily valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making due to its durability.</p>
<p>In some regions, the leaves may be used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may be used in minor traditional recipes in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its cultural significance is not well-documented, but it may hold symbolic value in local folklore or rituals.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus fraxinifolius var. guangxiensis has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Among the notable cultivars are 'Albolutea' and 'Variegata', which exhibit distinct leaf coloration and patterns. Hybrids of this variety are often developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and growth habit, making them more suitable for horticultural use. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban and suburban landscapes.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in landscaping and ornamental gardening, contributing to biodiversity and visual interest in gardens.</p>
