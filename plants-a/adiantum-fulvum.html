<p>Adiantum fulvum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of polypody fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored bloom on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while also absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Adiantum fulvum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>
