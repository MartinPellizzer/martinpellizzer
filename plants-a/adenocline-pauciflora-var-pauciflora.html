                    <h1>Adenocline pauciflora var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Adenocline pauciflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, dry fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its low floral display and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its unique adaptations.</p>
