<p>Astragalus laxmannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Astragalus laxmannii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
