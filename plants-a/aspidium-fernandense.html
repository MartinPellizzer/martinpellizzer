                    <h1>Aspidium fernandense</h1>
<p>Aspidium fernandense, commonly known as the São Tomé fern, is a species of fern native to the island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it receives indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Aspidium fernandense plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
