                <h1>Adenoderris viscidula</h1>
<p>Adenoderris viscidula, commonly known as the sticky adenoderris, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its sticky leaves and stems are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments, making it well-suited for dry habitats.</p>
<p>Adenoderris viscidula is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoderris viscidula has leaves that are elliptical in shape, opposite in arrangement, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and are dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, viscid texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from October to December, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoderris viscidula is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest environments, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, typically in areas with high rainfall. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenoderris viscidula is also occasionally found in coastal areas where it adapts to slightly different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoderris viscidula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming a potential weed in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions and can outcompete native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a concern for biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local flora.</p>
