<p>Abelmoschus mutabilis, commonly known as the okra, is a tropical and subtropical flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, mucilaginous pods that are typically harvested when young and tender. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The mucilage in its pods has been used historically for its soothing properties and culinary applications.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus mutabilis has leaves that are ovate to heart-shaped, with a slightly pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, moderately hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, with five petals, typically yellow or orange in color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>
