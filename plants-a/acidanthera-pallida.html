                <h1>Acidanthera pallida</h1>
<p>Acidanthera pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera pallida has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a pale greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. The flowers are small, white, and have a tubular shape with three petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera pallida is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in rocky soils and along the edges of fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera pallida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pale pink flowers. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant spreads through its seeds, which can be carried by wind, water, or animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
