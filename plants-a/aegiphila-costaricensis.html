                <h1>Aegiphila costaricensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican aegiphila, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and parts of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila costaricensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale pink petals, blooming from April to June, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
