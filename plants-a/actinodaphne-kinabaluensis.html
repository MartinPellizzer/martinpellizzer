                <h1>Actinodaphne kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the mountain's cloud forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kinabaluensis has elliptical to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns bright red when mature, dispersing primarily by birds eating the fruit and excreting the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the rocky and nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kinabaluensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in the western part, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. This species is endemic to the area around Mount Kinabalu, which is part of the Kinabalu National Park. It is commonly found in primary lowland and submontane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and localized species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kinabaluensis was mainly introduced to specific regions of Borneo, particularly in the lowland and montane rainforests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, which support its growth. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and is known for its aromatic leaves. Its introduction to these habitats has been largely due to natural dispersal and human activities such as logging and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is considered an important component of the local flora.</p>
