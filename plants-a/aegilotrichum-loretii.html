<p>Aegilotrichum loretii, commonly known as the Loretti's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features succulent, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotrichum loretii has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that has a slight fibrous texture. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a pale pink center, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
