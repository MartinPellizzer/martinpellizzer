                    <h1>Astragalus chtonocephalus</h1>
<p>Astragalus chtonocephalus, commonly known as the deep-rooted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep, extensive root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, aiding in water conservation.</p>
<p>Astragalus chtonocephalus is often found in steppe and desert environments, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological balance.</p>
