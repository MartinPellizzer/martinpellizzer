                <h1>Acomis lesteri</h1>
<p>Acomis lesteri, commonly known as the lesser acomis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acomis lesteri is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis lesteri has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and smooth, growing upright with a slight branching pattern, and it has a light green to pale yellowish color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale blue or violet petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis lesteri is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with coastal and inland wetland habitats. It is a herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis lesteri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
