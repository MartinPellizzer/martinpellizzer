                    <h1>Antennaria alpina var. megacephala</h1>
<p>Antennaria alpina var. megacephala, commonly known as the Alpine hair-puffball, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant has silky, woolly hairs covering its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, rounded heads, giving it a puffball-like appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
