                    <h1>Androsace rotundifolia var. incisa</h1>
<p>Androsace rotundifolia var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of rounded, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more sharply pointed than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
