                        <h1>Acacia × semibinervia</h1>
<p>Acacia × semibinervia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing some tolerance to salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia × semibinervia belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological characteristics.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific arrangement of petals. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their characteristic phyllodes and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia × semibinervia, a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acacia biebersteinii and Acacia longifolia, known for its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptability.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × semibinervia is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the state. This hybrid species is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It thrives in areas with a temperate climate and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern parts of New South Wales.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × semibinervia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in regions with warm, dry conditions where it thrives as a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it useful in soil rehabilitation and erosion control efforts. However, it has also been noted as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, posing ecological challenges in certain ecosystems.</p>
