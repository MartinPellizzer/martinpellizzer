                    <h1>Asclepias macrosperma</h1>
<p>Asclepias macrosperma, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture and are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Asclepias macrosperma plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
