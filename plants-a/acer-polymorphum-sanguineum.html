                <h1>Acer polymorphum sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum, commonly known as the red-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking crimson flowers that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The tree has palmate leaves with 5-7 lobes, which turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length; they are dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of yellow or green, blooming in early spring; these flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, primarily found in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to botanical gardens and conservation programs in other parts of the world. This species thrives in cold, moist environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting its fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum is a striking maple variety known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its vibrant red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. It also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in its vicinity. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by offering multiple benefits to the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum is a rare and ornamental tree known for its striking red foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local economies in regions where it is cultivated. In traditional medicine, its bark and leaves have been used by indigenous communities for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in the Andean regions of South America, where it is revered for its ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and unique appearance also make it a subject of ecological study and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer polymorphum sanguineum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued for their unique foliage colors and growth habits, such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Ruby Falls'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their vibrant autumn displays, making them popular in horticultural landscapes. Hybrids of Acer polymorphum sanguineum are sometimes created to enhance traits like cold hardiness or leaf coloration. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its striking red and orange foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is increasingly cultivated in regions with suitable climates.</p>
