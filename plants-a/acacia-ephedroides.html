<p>Acacia ephedroides, commonly known as the Chinese prickly acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and bipinnate leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers and small, woody pods that contain seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and has economic value in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in certain areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
