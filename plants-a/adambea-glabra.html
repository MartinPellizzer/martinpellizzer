                <h1>Adambea glabra</h1>
<p>Adambea glabra, commonly known as the smooth adambea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adambea glabra has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dull green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the spring season, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adambea glabra is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in open woodlands. This species thrives in coastal dunes and sandplain environments. It is often associated with the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of these habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adambea glabra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and riparian areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to management efforts in some parts of the country.</p>
