                    <h1>Andrachne pumila</h1>
<p>Andrachne pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming habit, with small, woolly, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
