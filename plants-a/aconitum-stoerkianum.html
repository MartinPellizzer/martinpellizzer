                <h1>Aconitum stoerkianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum stoerkianum, commonly known as Stoerk's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers that resemble a medieval monk's habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum stoerkianum has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, bell-shaped, and typically blue or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant survive in its alpine or subalpine habitat.</p>
