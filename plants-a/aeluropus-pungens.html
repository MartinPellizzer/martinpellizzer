                <h1>Aeluropus pungens</h1>
<p>Aeluropus pungens, commonly known as the sharpgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and sharp, spiky leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Aeluropus pungens is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus pungens has grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense, tufted clusters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, with a pale green to brown color, and they bloom in early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a fine, hairy appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or saline soils.</p>
