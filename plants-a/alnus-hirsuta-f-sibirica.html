<p>Alnus hirsuta f. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
