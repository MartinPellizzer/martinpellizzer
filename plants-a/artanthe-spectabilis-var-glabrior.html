                    <h1>Artanthe spectabilis var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Artanthe spectabilis var. glabrior, commonly known as the showy artanthe, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with five petals arranged in a radial pattern. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabrior" suggests a smoother texture compared to the typical form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
