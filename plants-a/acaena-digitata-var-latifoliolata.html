                        <h1>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata</h1>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood rose, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with many small, woody stems. The leaves are compound, typically with 5â€“7 leaflets that are broad and ovate in shape. It produces showy yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming part of the native vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the southern parts. This plant thrives in open grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the variable climate of these regions, including seasonal droughts and cool winters.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Andean foothills and surrounding plains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native vegetation in some regions.</p>
