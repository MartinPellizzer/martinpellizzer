                <h1>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata</h1>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood sorrel, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and produces yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to other varieties of Acaena digitata.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a broad, leathery texture and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length, and are often lobed or toothed along the margins. The stem is slender, woody, and exhibits a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, with a creeping or ascending growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spherical, dry achene with a persistent calyx, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced and established in the wild. This species thrives in temperate environments, often growing in open grasslands or along the edges of forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its conservation status may vary depending on local populations and habitat conditions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata is a hardy, low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, known for its dense, evergreen foliage and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with occasional applications of a balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or ferns can enhance its ornamental value and support local biodiversity.</p>
