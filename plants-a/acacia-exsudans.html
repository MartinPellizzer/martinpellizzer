                    <h1>Acacia exsudans</h1>
<p>Acacia exsudans, commonly known as the gum acacia or wild acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It is well-known for exuding a sticky, resinous gum from its bark, which has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>
<p>Acacia exsudans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
