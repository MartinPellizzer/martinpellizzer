                <h1>Acrospelion argenteum</h1>
<p>Acrospelion argenteum, commonly known as the silver spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, white flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant's silver-gray foliage is due to a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
<p>Acrospelion argenteum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion argenteum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>
