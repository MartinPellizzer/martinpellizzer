                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and establish persistent populations in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis canina var. sylvatica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for certain wildlife species.</p>
