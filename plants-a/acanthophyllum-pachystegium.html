<p>Acanthophyllum pachystegium, commonly known as the woolly acanthophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
