                        <h1>Acacia subtessarogona</h1>
<p>Acacia subtessarogona, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan and South Sudan. The plant is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves. Its yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia subtessarogona is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.</p>
