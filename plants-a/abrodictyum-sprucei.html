                        <h1>Abrodictyum sprucei</h1>
<p>Abrodictyum sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its botanical features include a slender, erect stem and strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abrodictyum sprucei is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting such unique flora.</p>
