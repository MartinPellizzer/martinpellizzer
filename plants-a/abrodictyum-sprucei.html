                        <h1>Abrodictyum sprucei</h1>
<p>Abrodictyum sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its botanical features include a slender, erect stem and strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abrodictyum sprucei is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting such unique flora.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrodictyum sprucei is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in cloud forests and mountainous areas where the climate is temperate and humid. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Andes, including well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrodictyum sprucei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon during the early 20th century. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, possibly as an ornamental species. It has since established itself in moist, shaded environments along streams and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
