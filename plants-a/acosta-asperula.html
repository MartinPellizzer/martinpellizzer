                <h1>Acosta asperula</h1>
<p>Acosta asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf acosta, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered in fine hairs, with a pale green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula is primarily native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>It has been observed in various regions including the southeastern United States and parts of Florida. The plant spreads rapidly due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and tolerate different environmental conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
