                <h1>Acosta asperula</h1>
<p>Acosta asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf acosta, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula is a flowering plant native to the tropical Andes of South America, primarily found in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions within its native range, though it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in cloud forests and undergrowth of montane forests. Acosta asperula is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though it is not yet listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub known for its vibrant blue flowers and resilience in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year, making it ideal for quick landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep irrigation during dry spells. Fertilization should be light and applied in spring, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials like lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and supports a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acosta asperula is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil health. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acosta asperula can act as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting sustainable ecosystems.</p>
