                <h1>Acrocephalus quarrei</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus quarrei, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually greenish or reddish, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Acrocephalus quarrei plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus quarrei has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, growing in dense clusters. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in spike-like inflorescences, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-sided capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus quarrei is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rocky shores, and saline soils where it thrives in harsh, arid environments. This plant is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, which allows it to colonize beach dunes and tidal zones. It is an important component of the flora in these ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus quarrei was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>It has been recorded in parts of Europe, particularly in the UK and France, where it thrives in saline and brackish environments. The plant is often found in salt marshes and along the edges of freshwater lakes. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land reclamation and coastal development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has established itself in several non-native regions beyond its original range.</p>
