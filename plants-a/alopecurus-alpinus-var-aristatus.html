                    <h1>Alopecurus alpinus var. aristatus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus alpinus var. aristatus, commonly known as the alpine hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed environments.</p>
