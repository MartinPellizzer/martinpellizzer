                    <h1>Alnus fruticosa var. sinuata</h1>
<p>Alnus fruticosa var. sinuata, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male flowers that release pollen, while female flowers are found on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
