<p>Allium nigrum var. multibulbosum, commonly known as the multi-bulb garlic, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered bulbs, which are smaller and more numerous than those of typical garlic varieties. The plant produces grass-like leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its bulbs are used in culinary applications, similar to regular garlic, but with a milder flavor.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species.</p>
