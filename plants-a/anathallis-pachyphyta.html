<p>Anathallis pachyphyta, commonly known as the thick-leaved spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated spike bearing numerous small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated by specific species of flies, which are attracted to its scent and coloration.</p>
