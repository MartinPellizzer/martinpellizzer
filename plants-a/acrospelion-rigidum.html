                <h1>Acrospelion rigidum</h1>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum, commonly known as the rigid rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Acrospelion rigidum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum has leaves that are narrow, elongated, and linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is rigid and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
