                <h1>Acianthera sulphurea</h1>
<p>Acianthera sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange floral coloration. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera sulphurea has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 3 to 6 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slight roughness near the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, featuring yellowish-white petals and a unique structure with a single stamen, blooming during the late spring to early summer months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sulphurea is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid tropical and subtropical environments. It is commonly associated with forested areas and is often seen growing on trees or rocks in the understory. The plant's distribution is limited to specific habitats within this geographic region.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sulphurea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and has a rapid growth rate, which contributes to its spread. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant communities.</p>
