                <h1>Achillea formosa subsp. amanica</h1>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica, commonly known as the western yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage and flowers are aromatic, and it is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The subspecies amanica is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral structure compared to other subspecies of Achillea formosa.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stems are upright, hairy, and have a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon. It is now found throughout much of the western U.S., including parts of Nevada and Arizona, as well as in some areas of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. The conservation status of Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica is listed as least concern by the IUCN, though it is considered rare in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial known for its finely divided, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 1-2 years and blooming from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, yarrow, or echinacea can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insect life.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and habitat.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to attract beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica is a flowering plant native to North America, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its bright yellow flowers. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically employed in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>The plant's resilience and beauty make it a valuable resource in ecological restoration projects, contributing to its industrial and economic significance. Culturally, it symbolizes healing and protection, often appearing in folklore and traditional practices.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity further highlights its importance in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa subsp.</p>
<p>amanica has several popular cultivars such as 'Avalanche' and 'Raven's Feather', which are prized for their dense, fluffy flower heads and vibrant colors. It also has been hybridized with other members of the Achillea genus to produce cultivars with enhanced hardiness and extended bloom periods.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved disease resistance and a wider range of color options. Horticulturally, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings.</p>
