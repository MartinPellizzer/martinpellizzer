                <h1>Acrocarpus stellatus</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus, commonly known as the silver tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray bark and leathery, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by clustered, edible fruits resembling small, round berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The silver tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length. The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Australia and has been introduced to other tropical regions. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its relatively wide distribution and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and timber.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings showing higher success rates when rooted in a humid environment. The growth cycle of this tree is rapid, reaching maturity in about 5 to 10 years, making it suitable for quick landscape development.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and remove dead or diseased branches. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while fungal diseases may occur in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can improve soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of other crops. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to improving soil fertility by acting as a nitrogen fixer through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used as a vegetable in traditional dishes, particularly in Southeast Asian cuisines. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as skin infections and respiratory issues due to its anti-inflammatory properties.
