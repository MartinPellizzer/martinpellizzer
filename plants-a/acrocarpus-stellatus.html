                <h1>Acrocarpus stellatus</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus, commonly known as the star-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its leaves are opposite and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable timber and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the wet season, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed areas. It is also present in some parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the natural vegetation patterns of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus stellatus was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for its ornamental value and potential for erosion control. However, it has since spread rapidly due to its high reproductive capacity and adaptability to local conditions. The plant outcompetes native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances in the region.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on the native flora.</p>
