                <h1>Acalypha bullata</h1>
<p>Acalypha bullata, commonly known as the white-veined copperleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with bright yellow veins contrasting against dark green foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha bullata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha bullata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a vibrant green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha bullata is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in moist forests or along riverbanks. Acalypha bullata is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although local populations may face threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha bullata is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, feather-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha bullata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit acts as shelter for small mammals and birds, offering protection from predators and harsh weather. The plant also acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Overall, Acalypha bullata plays a significant ecological role by supporting biodiversity and maintaining soil integrity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
