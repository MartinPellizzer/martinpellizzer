<p>Adhatoda martiana, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Malabar Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in various cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda martiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with a white or pale blue color, and they bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda martiana is a tropical shrub native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of South Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, due to human introduction. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Adhatoda martiana is listed as least concern by the IUCN, but localized threats such as habitat loss and overharvesting pose risks to its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda martiana is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>
