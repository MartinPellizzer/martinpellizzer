<p>Atriplex fasciculiflora, commonly known as the clustered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt glands, aiding in salt excretion. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender peduncles. It is well adapted to saline and drought-prone soils, making it a hardy species for marginal lands.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
