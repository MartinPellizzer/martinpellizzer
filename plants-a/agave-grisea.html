                    <h1>Agave grisea</h1>
<p>Agave grisea, commonly known as the gray agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by the development of its characteristic blue-green berries. Agave grisea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional practices by indigenous communities.</p>
