                    <h1>Astragalus nachitschevanicus</h1>
<p>Astragalus nachitschevanicus, commonly known as the Caucasian milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan, and thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the genus Astragalus. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus nachitschevanicus is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
