                    <h1>Arundo donax var. coleotricha</h1>
<p>Arundo donax var. coleotricha, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a variant of the giant reed, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in wet or marshy environments. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native habitats if not managed carefully.</p>
