                        <h1>Acetosella glauca</h1>
<p>Acetosella glauca, commonly known as blue toothwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that give them a bluish sheen, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Acetosella glauca is often found in calcareous soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
