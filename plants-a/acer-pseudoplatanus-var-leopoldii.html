<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's maple, is a rare variant of the sycamore maple.</p>

Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully develop.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
