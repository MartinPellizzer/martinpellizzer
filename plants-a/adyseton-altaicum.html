                <h1>Adyseton altaicum</h1>
<p>Adyseton altaicum, commonly known as the Alaska mountain avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season.</p>
<p>Adyseton altaicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton altaicum has leaves that are simple, alternate, and lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton altaicum is primarily native to the northern regions of North America, specifically Canada and the northern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in boreal and subarctic environments, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open or disturbed habitats such as forest edges, meadows, and wetlands. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton altaicum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside areas. This plant has been noted for its ability to thrive in cooler climates with high humidity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas for its ornamental value.</p>
