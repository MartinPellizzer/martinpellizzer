                <h1>Achillea semipectinata</h1>
<p>Achillea semipectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Achillea semipectinata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea semipectinata has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to brownish color. Its flowers are small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea semipectinata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in areas with low precipitation and is often seen in mountainous and coastal regions. Its native range includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea semipectinata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. This plant is often found in areas with low fertility and high exposure to wind and sun. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming land that was previously unsuitable for agriculture.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances.</p>
