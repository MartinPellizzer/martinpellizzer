                <h1>Aconitopsis aconiti</h1>
<p>Aconitopsis aconiti, commonly known as the lesser aconite, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers with five petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitopsis aconiti has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. It produces racemose inflorescences of blue to violet flowers with showy petals and a spurred lip, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and tuberous, adapting to its habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitopsis aconiti is primarily native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions spanning Nepal, India, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. This plant is also occasionally recorded in parts of northern Myanmar and southern China. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitopsis aconiti was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environments including roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in regions outside its native range, often competing with native flora. Due to its toxicity, it poses a risk to grazing animals and humans.</p>
<p>Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to form dense colonies and produce a large number of seeds.</p>
