                <h1>Aegilops speltiformis</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltiformis, commonly known as false spelt, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-lobed spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Aegilops speltiformis has been studied for its potential in breeding programs due to its genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops speltiformis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and has a smooth texture with a light green to grayish hue, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with small, two-lipped flowers that are pale green to brown in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent spikelet that releases small, hard seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
