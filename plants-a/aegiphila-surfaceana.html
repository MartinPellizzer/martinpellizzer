                <h1>Aegiphila surfaceana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila surfaceana, commonly known as the coastal aegiphila, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Aegiphila surfaceana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila surfaceana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring a white to pale pink color, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
