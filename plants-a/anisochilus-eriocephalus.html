                    <h1>Anisochilus eriocephalus</h1>
<p>Anisochilus eriocephalus, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in humid conditions.</p>
