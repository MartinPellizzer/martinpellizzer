<p>Acacia rupestris, commonly known as the rock acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acacia rupestris is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
