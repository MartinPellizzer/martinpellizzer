                    <h1>Allium karakense</h1>
<p>Allium karakense, commonly known as the Karakoram garlic, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a strong garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium karakense is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
