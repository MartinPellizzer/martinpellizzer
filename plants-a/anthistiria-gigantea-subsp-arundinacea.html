<p>Anthistiria gigantea subsp.</p>
<p>arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
