                    <h1>Agave maculata</h1>
<p>Agave maculata, commonly known as the spotted agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white or grayish markings. The leaves have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers on a tall stem, which appear after several years of growth.</p>
<p>The plant is popular in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
