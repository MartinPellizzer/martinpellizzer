<p>Alopecurus anthoxanthoides, commonly known as the yellow sweetgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments.</p>
<p>Alopecurus anthoxanthoides is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
