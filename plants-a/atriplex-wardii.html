<p>Atriplex wardii, commonly known as the Ward's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration. It produces small green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Atriplex wardii is often found in saline soils and is well-suited for revegetation projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
