                        <h1>Acantholimon curviflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon curviflorum, commonly known as the curlyflower sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent, bluish-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Acantholimon curviflorum is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon curviflorum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained environments and is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of Nevada and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon curviflorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive adequate sunlight and has minimal competition from other vegetation. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in degraded habitats. Its introduction has been noted in several regions where it has established itself as a persistent weed.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in suitable conditions, making it a challenge for land managers.</p>
