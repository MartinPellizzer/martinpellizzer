                <h1>Achyranthes maritima</h1>
<p>Achyranthes maritima, commonly known as sea knotgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Achyranthes maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes maritima has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 3-8 cm long and 1-3 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale yellow to greenish-white petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to coastal environments with sandy or saline soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes maritima is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity. This plant is commonly found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and parts of North Africa like Morocco and Tunisia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes maritima was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed soils in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has become a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and can tolerate saline conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded habitats.</p>
