<p>Achyranthes maritima, commonly known as sea knotgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Achyranthes maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
