                <h1>Achyrophorus webbii</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus webbii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus webbii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically pink to red in color, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus webbii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often associated with limestone or calcareous soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered vulnerable to habitat degradation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus webbii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments, often as a result of human activities such as land development and agriculture.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant has spread beyond its native range due to its adaptability and ability to colonize new habitats quickly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in invaded regions.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
