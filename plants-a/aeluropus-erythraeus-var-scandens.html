                    <h1>Aeluropus erythraeus var. scandens</h1>
<p>Aeluropus erythraeus var. scandens, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in saline or coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for drought and salt. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, aiding in water retention and reducing transpiration.</p>
