                    <h1>Abies cephalonica var. submutica</h1>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. submutica, commonly known as the West Greek fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of western Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered with a fine, whitish bloom. The cones are small and typically hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in well-drained soils at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
