                    <h1>Aspidium cicutarium var. coadunatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium cicutarium var. coadunatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
