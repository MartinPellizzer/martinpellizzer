                    <h1>Aconitum × vulgare var. bracteolosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × vulgare var. bracteolosum, commonly known as the bracteolosum monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple, spurred flowers that resemble a hood, hence its common name. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids, requiring caution in cultivation and handling.</p>
