                        <h1>Acacia leucolobia</h1>
<p>Acacia leucolobia, commonly known as the white-leaf acacia, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow to pale yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia leucolobia is adapted to dry environments and is often found in savannas and woodlands.</p>
<p>It has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for certain ecological and horticultural applications.</p>
