                <h1>Achillea novae-graeciae</h1>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae, commonly known as the Greek yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing qualities.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is perennial, and it often forms dense mats in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to grayish bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, including coastal cliffs and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with limestone and calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae was mainly introduced to gardens and naturalized areas in regions with temperate climates, particularly in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its daisy-like flowers and hardy nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond cultivated areas in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered non-invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
