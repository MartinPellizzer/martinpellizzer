                <h1>Achillea novae-graeciae</h1>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae, commonly known as the Greek yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, flat-topped clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its stems are upright and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are gray-green in color, with a woolly texture, and are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a dense layer of white hairs, turning reddish-brown with age. The flowers are pale yellow to white, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae is a flowering plant native to the island of Naxos in the Greek Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in its native range on Naxos and possibly on nearby islands such as Paros and Antiparos. This species thrives in rocky, sunny environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. It typically occurs at altitudes between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea novae-graeciae is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry spells. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it also contributes to improving soil structure and fertility over time.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea novae-graeciae is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its showy white and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically explored for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing aesthetic appeal and supporting biodiversity. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific meanings are less documented compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in ornamental horticulture and ecological settings.</p>
