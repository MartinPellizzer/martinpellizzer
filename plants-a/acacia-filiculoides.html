<p>Acacia filiculoides, commonly known as the fern-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown.</p>
