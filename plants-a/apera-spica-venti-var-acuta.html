                    <h1>Apera spica-venti var. acuta</h1>
<p>Apera spica-venti var. acuta, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, in fields, and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
