<p>Aporum acerosum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, glossy green color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
