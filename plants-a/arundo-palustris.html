                    <h1>Arundo palustris</h1>
<p>Arundo palustris, commonly known as marsh reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable habitat-forming species and a potential invasive in some areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions.</p>
