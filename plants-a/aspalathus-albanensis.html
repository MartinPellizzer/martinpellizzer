                    <h1>Aspalathus albanensis</h1>
<p>Aspalathus albanensis, commonly known as the Albanian bushveld pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Aspalathus albanensis is not widely cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and potential medicinal properties.</p>
