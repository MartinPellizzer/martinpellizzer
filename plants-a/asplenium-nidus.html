                    <h1>Asplenium nidus</h1>
<p>Asplenium nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest.</p>
<p>It has a creeping rhizome that produces new plantlets, which can take root and grow independently. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Asplenium nidus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.</p>
