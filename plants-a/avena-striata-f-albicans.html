                    <h1>Avena striata f. albicans</h1>
<p>Avena striata f. albicans, commonly known as the white oat or white-striated oat, is a variant of the common oat species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white stripes on the leaves, which set it apart from the typical green foliage of other oat varieties. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The white coloration of its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects pigmentation, making it a unique ornamental and horticultural specimen.</p>
