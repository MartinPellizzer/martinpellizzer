                <h1>Adenosma microcephala</h1>
<p>Adenosma microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed adenosma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma microcephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma microcephala has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma microcephala is primarily native to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, forested areas and is often associated with lowland habitats. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma microcephala was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas along the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes and salt marshes where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This plant has adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it a resilient species in these habitats. It is often seen as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystem balance.</p>
