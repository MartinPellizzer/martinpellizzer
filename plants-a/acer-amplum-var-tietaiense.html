                <h1>Acer amplum var. tietaiense</h1>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense, commonly known as the Tietai maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad, triangular shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in the autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in the Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. This species typically grows in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining healthy plant populations. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, which benefits surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense is a lesser-known maple species native to specific regions of China, primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have traditional uses in certain regional cuisines. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to forest ecosystems and may support local economies through sustainable forestry practices.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and natural harmony.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amplum var. tietaiense has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Variegatum' being one of the most popular for its striking variegated leaves.</p>
<p>While it is not widely hybridized due to its limited cultivation, some crosses with other maple species have been attempted in horticultural trials. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal, particularly its vibrant foliage, making it a sought-after addition to specialized gardens. Its unique characteristics contribute to its horticultural importance in regions with suitable climates.</p>
<p>Despite its appeal, it remains a relatively rare and niche choice among maple cultivars.</p>
