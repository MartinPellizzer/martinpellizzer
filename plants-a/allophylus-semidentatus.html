<p>Allophylus semidentatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in catkins and appear in the spring, followed by small, round drupes.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
