                    <h1>Anemia rigida</h1>
<p>Anemia rigida, commonly known as rigid anemia, is a rare and unusual plant species characterized by its stiff, woody stems and lack of typical vascular tissue.</p>
<p>It is found in specific, often remote, alpine or arctic environments where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's leaves are small, leathery, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers, when present, are usually unisexual and clustered in small, inconspicuous inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
