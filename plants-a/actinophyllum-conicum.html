                <h1>Actinophyllum conicum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum conicum, commonly known as the conical actinophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive conical shape and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Actinophyllum conicum is typically found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum conicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and smooth, with a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a bushy appearance. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum conicum is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in heathlands, open forests, and rocky areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland regions. It is known for its distinctive conical inflorescence and is a member of the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum conicum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites and is now considered a minor weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
