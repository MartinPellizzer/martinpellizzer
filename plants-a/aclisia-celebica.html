                <h1>Aclisia celebica</h1>
<p>Aclisia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes starling vine, is a climbing plant native to the Moluccas in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. Aclisia celebica is often found in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian archipelago, particularly found in the islands of Sulawesi and the surrounding region of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these regions, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It typically grows in lowland and montane forests, often near streams or in moist, shaded undergrowth. Aclisia celebica is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica is a tropical climbing plant known for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, including insects and birds. It acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Additionally, it contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Through its ecological functions, Aclisia celebica plays an important role in maintaining the balance of its native ecosystem.</p>
