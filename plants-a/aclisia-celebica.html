                <h1>Aclisia celebica</h1>
<p>Aclisia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes moonvine, is a climbing vine native to Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica is primarily native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forest regions of the island. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in shaded undergrowth near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia celebica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands through human activity, including trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, coastal dunes, and degraded forests. The plant has adapted well to the tropical climate of these regions, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
