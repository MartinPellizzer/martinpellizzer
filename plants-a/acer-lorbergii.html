                <h1>Acer lorbergii</h1>
<p>Acer lorbergii, commonly known as the Lorberg maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lorbergii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green during the growing season and turn vibrant red to orange in the fall. The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lorbergii is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered in the wild, with current distribution limited to a few isolated locations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. This species grows at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat fragmentation, Acer lorbergii is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lorbergii is a striking maple tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer lorbergii includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with acid-loving plants like azaleas or rhododendrons can enhance its growth in suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lorbergii is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in the spring. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lorbergii is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree's wood, though not commonly used industrially, contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in Chinese botany and is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and soil stability also underscores its ecological importance in native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lorbergii has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are known for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often favored in ornamental horticulture for their striking color displays. Hybrids of Acer lorbergii have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. The plant holds significant horticultural importance due to its adaptability and aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees used in both residential and commercial landscaping.</p>
