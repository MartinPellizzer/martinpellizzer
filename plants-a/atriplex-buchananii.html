<p>Atriplex buchananii, commonly known as Buchanan's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of saltbush habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme drought conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
