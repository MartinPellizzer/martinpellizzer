<p>Adina rubella, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often reddish in color when young. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown capsules containing numerous seeds. Adina rubella is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina rubella has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright manner. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina rubella is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of the United States and Australia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth, typically growing in humid and warm climates. Adina rubella is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina rubella is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its attractive red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Adina rubella is relatively slow, with new growth occurring primarily in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in garden settings.</p>
