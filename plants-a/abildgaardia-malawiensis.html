<p>Abildgaardia malawiensis, commonly known as the Malawi water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Lake Malawi in East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the lake's sediment while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia malawiensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of the lake's aquatic ecosystem.</p>
