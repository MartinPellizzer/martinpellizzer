<p>Allium moly, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain three seeds each, which are dispersed by animals.
