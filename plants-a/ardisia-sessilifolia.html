                    <h1>Ardisia sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Ardisia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf evergreen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Ardisia sessilifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It thrives in shady, moist environments and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
