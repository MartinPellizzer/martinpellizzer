                <h1>Acacia seyal f. fistula</h1>
<p>Acacia seyal f. fistula, commonly known as the knobthorn tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorned branches and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces long, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is adapted to arid environments with its deep root system.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard wood and is used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia seyal f. fistula has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are yellow and arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, consisting of small, tubular flowers with a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a flat, leathery pod containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and taproot-like, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia seyal f. fistula is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and parts of Kenya and Somalia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends across the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant is typically found in dry savannas, rocky outcrops, and coastal areas, preferring well-drained soils. It grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acacia seyal f. fistula is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia seyal f. fistula is a hardy, drought-tolerant tree native to arid and semi-arid regions, known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification and stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle includes a slow initial phase followed by rapid growth during the rainy season, with flowering typically occurring in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or aphids, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance nitrogen availability in the soil.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia seyal f. fistula is a hardy shrub or tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds, insects, and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, and also serves as a food source for grazing animals like antelope and goats. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Overall, Acacia seyal f. fistula contributes significantly to the ecological balance of arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
