<p>Anthephora elegans var. acuminata, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose raceme, typically blooming during the late winter to early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
