<p>Adinandra glischroloma var. glischroloma, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a species native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
