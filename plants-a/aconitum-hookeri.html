                <h1>Aconitum hookeri</h1>
<p>Aconitum hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>Aconitum hookeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum hookeri has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hookeri is primarily native to China South-Central, East Himalaya, and Nepal.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions characterized by mountainous terrain and temperate climates. It typically grows in forested areas and alpine meadows at higher elevations. The species is well adapted to the cooler and moist conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for high-altitude habitats in these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hookeri was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with cool summers and cold winters. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures, though its toxicity requires caution.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural interest and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
