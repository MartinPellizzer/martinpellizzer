                <h1>Achimenes pyropaea</h1>
<p>Achimenes pyropaea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical perennial herb native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy, and slightly hairy leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces showy bracts that often resemble the flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achimenes pyropaea thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a garden plant for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes pyropaea has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement and typically measure about 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are tubular with a prominent spur, displaying vibrant red or orange hues, and they bloom from summer to autumn; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes pyropaea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. This species is commonly associated with shaded or semi-shaded environments within these rainforests. It is often found growing in the understorey of the forest canopy, where it benefits from the dappled light.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in various parts of the world, but its natural habitat remains restricted to its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes pyropaea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, but has been widely cultivated in other parts of the world. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, care must be taken to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
