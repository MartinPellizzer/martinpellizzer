                <h1>Acinodendron alatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron alatum, commonly known as the winged acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its distinctive winged stems and opposite, ovate leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, typical of the Rubiaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alatum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching occurring from the base. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alatum is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in primary and secondary rainforests. This plant is often associated with shaded undergrowth and is an important component of the forest understory. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in many of its range countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alatum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. It has also been introduced to parts of Africa and the Caribbean as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
