                    <h1>Asplenium uhligii</h1>
<p>Asplenium uhligii, commonly known as the Uhlig's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with delicate, lance-shaped fronds. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
