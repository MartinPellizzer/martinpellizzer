                        <h1>Acacia fasciculata var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acacia fasciculata var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow globular flowers that appear in winter. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous tiny, feathery leaflets, and the plant is often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, tolerating salt spray and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia fasciculata var. pubescens is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This variety thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with riverine habitats. It is well adapted to the climate of the region, tolerating both drought and seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia fasciculata var. pubescens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in native grasslands and open woodlands, where it forms dense thickets. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is important to manage its spread to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
