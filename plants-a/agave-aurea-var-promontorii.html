                    <h1>Agave aurea var. promontorii</h1>
<p>Agave aurea var. promontorii, commonly known as the coastal agave, is a succulent plant native to the rocky coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with small, white tubercles and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces a tall flowering stalk with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
