<p>Abies cilicica subsp.</p>
<p>isaurica, commonly known as the Isaurian fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other fir species.</p>
<p>The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
