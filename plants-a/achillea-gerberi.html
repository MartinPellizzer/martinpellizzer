<p>Achillea gerberi, commonly known as the Gerber's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features feathery, aromatic leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine beds.</p>
<p>Achillea gerberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gerberi has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray hue, arranged in a rosette formation, and measure up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and smooth with a light green color, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding dark褐色 disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gerberi is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, specifically found on the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, and El Hierro.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these three islands, where it grows in rocky, coastal areas and open vegetation. It thrives in a Mediterranean-type climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and invasive species, Achillea gerberi is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gerberi is a hardy perennial known for its showy, flat-topped flower heads and fragrant foliage, often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a summer growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during dry periods, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while pruning spent flower heads encourages continuous blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>
