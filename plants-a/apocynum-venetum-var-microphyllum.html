<p>Apocynum venetum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic, containing cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>The small, narrow leaves of this variety distinguish it from other forms of Apocynum venetum.</p>
