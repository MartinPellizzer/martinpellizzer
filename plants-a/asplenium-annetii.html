<p>Asplenium annetii, commonly known as the Annet's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in humid, shaded environments such as on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the leaves, which is characteristic of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium annetii thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
