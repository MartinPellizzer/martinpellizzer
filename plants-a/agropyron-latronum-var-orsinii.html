                    <h1>Agropyron latronum var. orsinii</h1>
<p>Agropyron latronum var. orsinii, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and steppe ecosystems.</p>
