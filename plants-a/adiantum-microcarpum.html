                <h1>Adiantum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Adiantum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruit maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adiantum microcarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum microcarpum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, with a smooth texture, and range in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Adiantum microcarpum is a spore-bearing plant and does not produce flowers, fruits, or seeds; instead, it reproduces through spores released from the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum microcarpum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in the understory of temperate and subtropical forests. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with mountainous regions. It is also present in parts of eastern Asia, including the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is typically found in specific microhabitats rather than widespread locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum microcarpum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural dispersal and horticultural activities.</p>
