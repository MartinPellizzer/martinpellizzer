                <h1>Actinodaphne latifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne latifolia has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with yellowish-green petals, arranged in clusters, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellow drupe that disperses its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne latifolia is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in the eastern and western parts of the island. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in lowland and montane forests. It is a member of the Lauraceae family and is known for its aromatic leaves and fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne latifolia was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it has been cultivated for its aromatic wood and ornamental value. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its unique chemical composition. Its introduction to new areas has sometimes led to its establishment as an invasive species, raising ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
