<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rugata var. concinna was mainly introduced to South Australia and southern New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in open woodlands. This plant is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. It has also been introduced to parts of Victoria and Queensland as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited to specific environmental conditions and does not typically become invasive.</p>
