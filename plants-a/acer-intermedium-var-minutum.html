<p>Acer intermedium var. minutum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in gardens and as a landscape specimen.</p>
