                <h1>Abutilon angulatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon angulatum, commonly known as the angular abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon angulatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon angulatum has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth surface and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody at the base, and has a rough, fissured bark that becomes more cracked with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a trumpet shape, usually in shades of yellow or orange, blooming from summer to autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon angulatum is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other tropical and subtropical regions, though its natural distribution remains largely restricted to its native range. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Abutilon angulatum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon angulatum is a fast-growing, bushy shrub native to South America, known for its vibrant, maple-like leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil, requiring regular watering during the growing season but avoiding waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring and summer, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
