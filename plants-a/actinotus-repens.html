                <h1>Actinotus repens</h1>
<p>Actinotus repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Actinotus repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus repens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing prostrate along the ground. The flowers are small, bell-shaped, and grouped in clusters, with a pale blue to violet color, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus repens is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathlands and open woodlands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive blue to violet flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the coastal areas of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus repens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of European flora. The plant has since spread throughout various regions of the country, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered invasive, it has become naturalized in many parts of New Zealand.</p>
