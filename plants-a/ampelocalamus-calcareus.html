                    <h1>Ampelocalamus calcareus</h1>
<p>Ampelocalamus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone reed, is a grass-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of dust or salt. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, which is reflected in its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, Ampelocalamus calcareus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
