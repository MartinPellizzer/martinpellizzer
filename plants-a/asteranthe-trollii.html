<p>Asteranthe trollii, commonly known as the Troll's aster, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces showy, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asteranthe trollii is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous areas.</p>
