                <h1>Acinodendron macranthum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acinodendron macranthum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron macranthum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron macranthum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with limestone hills and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of India and the Philippines as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron macranthum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has been particularly noted in moist, forested environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
