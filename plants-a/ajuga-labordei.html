                    <h1>Ajuga labordei</h1>
<p>Ajuga labordei, commonly known as the mountain bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense ground cover.</p>
