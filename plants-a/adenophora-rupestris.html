<p>Adenophora rupestris, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora rupestris has basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base with a compact, cushion-like growth pattern.

<p>These regions are located in the Russian Far East and Siberia, where the plant thrives in rocky and mountainous environments. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine areas, often growing on slopes and cliffs. The plant is adapted to the cold, harsh climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora rupestris was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is commonly associated with disturbed areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often seen blooming with purple to blue flowers in late summer.</p>
