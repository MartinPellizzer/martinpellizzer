                <h1>Adiantum phanomensis</h1>
<p>Adiantum phanomensis, commonly known as the Phantom fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum phanomensis has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a smooth, waxy surface, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on environmental conditions. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum phanomensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern areas. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is often seen growing near streams or in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its native distribution in Thailand highlights its adaptation to the region's warm and humid climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum phanomensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China. Its introduction to new areas has sometimes led to its establishment in disturbed or cultivated lands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses worldwide.</p>
