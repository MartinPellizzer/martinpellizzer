<p>Actephilopsis malayana, commonly known as the Malay orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephilopsis malayana has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in clusters during the summer months and are pollinated by insects.

<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments under the canopy of dense vegetation. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is not commonly found in open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephilopsis malayana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
