                    <h1>Apodanthes</h1>
<p>Apodanthes, commonly known as the "false flame trees," are a genus of flowering plants in the family Apodanthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique morphology, with a highly reduced stem and a dense cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. They are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Apodanthes species are native to Africa and are often found in open habitats such as savannas and woodlands.</p>
<p>Their striking floral display makes them an important component of their ecological communities.</p>
