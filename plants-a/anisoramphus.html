<p>Anisoramphus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often display a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Anisoramphus species are often used in native plant gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
