                <h1>Adenia celebica</h1>
<p>Adenia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes adenia, is a climbing shrub native to the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, pale yellow to green flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenia celebica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia celebica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are large and showy, with a five-lobed structure, typically pink or red in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia celebica is a rare plant species native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in specific regions of the island, particularly in the lowland and mountainous areas of the central and southern parts. This species thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adenia celebica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia celebica is a tropical vine native to Indonesia, known for its striking foliage and potential ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a climbing growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and requiring a support structure for optimal development.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenia celebica is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and nectar-rich blooms. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adenia celebica contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
