                <h1>Acrostichum paleaceum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum paleaceum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with small, overlapping pinnae that contribute to its intricate texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum paleaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum paleaceum has long, narrow, and linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light brown bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dryness and wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum paleaceum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in the Caribbean islands, as well as in regions of Mexico and the southern United States. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum paleaceum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands where it can thrive in moist, saline conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and frequent rainfall, such as tropical and subtropical zones. This plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia. It is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
