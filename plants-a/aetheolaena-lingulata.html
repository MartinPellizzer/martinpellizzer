<p>Aetheolaena lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish-white flowers, followed by small berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Aetheolaena lingulata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its environment.</p>
