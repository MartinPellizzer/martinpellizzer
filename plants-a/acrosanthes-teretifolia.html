                <h1>Acrosanthes teretifolia</h1>
<p>Acrosanthes teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Acrosanthes teretifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in horticulture for its dense, evergreen foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes teretifolia has leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a lanceolate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are tubular and yellowish-green, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes teretifolia is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This species is found in the coastal and mountainous regions of the area. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly seen in open woodlands and coastal dunes. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Cape Provinces, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes teretifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in coastal and semi-coastal environments. The plant is often found growing in sandy soils and along the edges of forests, adapting well to the local climate. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite its non-native status, it has become a notable part of the local botanical landscape.</p>
