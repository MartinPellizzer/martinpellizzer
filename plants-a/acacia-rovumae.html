                        <h1>Acacia rovumae</h1>
<p>Acacia rovumae, commonly known as the Rovuma acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia rovumae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rovumae is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and spiny regions of the southeastern part of the island. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is part of the Fabaceae family and is known for its distinctive, flattened pods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rovumae was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and a warm climate, typically found in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, where it forms dense shrublands. This plant has been introduced to parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and South Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its hardy nature and use in erosion control.</p>
