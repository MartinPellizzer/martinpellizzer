<p>Acianthus collinus, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Acianthus collinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus collinus has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>

<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus collinus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The introduction likely occurred through horticultural trade and garden plantings. It has since spread to nearby areas, including parts of Washington and northern California.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized and not widespread in the wild.</p>
