<p>abavia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
