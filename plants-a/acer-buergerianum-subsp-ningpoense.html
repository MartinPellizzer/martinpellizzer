                <h1>Acer buergerianum subsp. ningpoense</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>ningpoense has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stems. The stems are slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>ningpoense is a rare maple species native to eastern China, specifically the Zhejiang province. Its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in the mountainous regions of southern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>ningpoense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining specific cultivar traits.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring partial shade to full sun. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>ningpoense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the health of surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>ningpoense is a unique maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.
