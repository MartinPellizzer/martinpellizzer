                    <h1>Allittia uliginosa</h1>
<p>Allittia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism composed of a fungal partner and algal or cyanobacterial symbionts, making it a lichen rather than a true plant. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to surfaces, often appearing as a green or yellowish film. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized requirements, Allittia uliginosa is often used as an indicator species for the health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
