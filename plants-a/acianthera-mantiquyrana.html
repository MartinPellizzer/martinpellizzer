<p>Acianthera mantiquyrana, commonly known as the Mantiqueira orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera mantiquyrana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera mantiquyrana is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the subtropical and tropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in humid, forested environments with well-drained soil. The plant is adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in shaded undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera mantiquyrana was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils, making it suitable for areas like parts of South America and the Caribbean. This plant is often found in shaded, forested habitats, where it can grow as an epiphyte on trees or in the undergrowth. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural interests due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>
