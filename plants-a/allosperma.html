                    <h1>Allosperma</h1>
<p>Allosperma, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, often white or yellowish flowers. Allosperma species are generally low-growing, with a rosette or spreading growth habit, and they are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats and are of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
