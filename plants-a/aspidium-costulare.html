<p>Aspidium costulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing leaves called sporangia.</p>
<p>Aspidium costulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
