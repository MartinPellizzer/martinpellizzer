                <h1>Adenosma punctata</h1>
<p>Adenosma punctata, commonly known as the spotted adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough texture with prominent veins.</p>
<p>Adenosma punctata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma punctata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma punctata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, particularly in areas with moist and humid climates. The plant thrives in forest understories and along stream banks, where it receives partial to full shade. Its distribution is largely confined to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the region's unique ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma punctata was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with disturbed soil and full sunlight. This plant is often found in coastal regions and can tolerate saline conditions. It spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
