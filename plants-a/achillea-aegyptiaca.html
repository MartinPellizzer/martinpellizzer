<p>Achillea aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, aromatic scent, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca has leaves that are basal, lanceolate to linear in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth, greenish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are yellow, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Egypt and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, often in disturbed or marginal habitats. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and dry fields. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level to about 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by urbanization and land use changes, leading to a conservation status of least concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seed sowing typically done in early spring. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and it thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
