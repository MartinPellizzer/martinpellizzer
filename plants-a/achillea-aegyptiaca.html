<p>Achillea aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of grey-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody at the base, and has a grayish-brown bark with a rough texture. The flowers are yellow, forming flat-topped umbels with ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy environments, often growing on slopes and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its habitat is increasingly affected by urbanization and land use changes, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aegyptiaca is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers, commonly grown in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with seeds germinating best in spring when temperatures are warm. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through a period of rest in winter and actively growing during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.
