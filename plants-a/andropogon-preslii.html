<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. The plant features narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fine texture, adaptability to wet conditions, and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
