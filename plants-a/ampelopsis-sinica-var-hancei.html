<p>Ampelopsis sinica var. hancei, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
