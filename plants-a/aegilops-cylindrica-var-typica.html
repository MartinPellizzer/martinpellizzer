<p>Aegilops cylindrica var. typica, commonly known as the wild barley, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and rough, hairy surfaces. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential role in crop improvement and its genetic relationship to cultivated barley.</p>
