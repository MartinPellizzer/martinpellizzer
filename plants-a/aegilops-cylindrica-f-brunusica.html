                    <h1>Aegilops cylindrica f. brunusica</h1>
<p>Aegilops cylindrica f. brunusica, commonly known as the black false wheat, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and dark-colored glumes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and develops hard, indehiscent seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in crop improvement.</p>
