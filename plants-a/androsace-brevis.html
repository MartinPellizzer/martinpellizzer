                    <h1>Androsace brevis</h1>
<p>Androsace brevis, commonly known as the shortleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation.</p>
