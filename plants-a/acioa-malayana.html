<p>Acioa malayana, commonly known as the Malay acacia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa malayana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more dense as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa malayana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, growing in humid, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Acioa malayana is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa malayana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a weed.</p>
