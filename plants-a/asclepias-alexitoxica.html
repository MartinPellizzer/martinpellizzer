                    <h1>Asclepias alexitoxica</h1>
<p>Asclepias alexitoxica, commonly known as the toxic milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are broad and oval, often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>Like other milkweeds, it contains toxic sap that can be harmful if ingested, though it serves as a food source for certain butterfly species.</p>
