<p>Amauropelta bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are tightly curled when young and unfurl gradually as the plant matures. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it survive in its cool and humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
