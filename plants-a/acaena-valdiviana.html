                        <h1>Acaena valdiviana</h1>
<p>Acaena valdiviana, commonly known as the Chilean burr bush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of prickly, spherical fruits. Its fruiting bodies, known as burrs, contain seeds enclosed in a tough, spiny covering.</p>
<p>Acaena valdiviana is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena valdiviana is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in the Valdivian temperate rainforest. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in forest understories. It is also present in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Acaena valdiviana is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often part of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena valdiviana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of native South American flora. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas and along coastal margins.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact.</p>
