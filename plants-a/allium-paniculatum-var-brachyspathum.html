<p>Allium paniculatum var. brachyspathum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in shades of pink to purple, typically in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and can be used similarly to regular garlic, though they are milder in taste.</p>
<p>This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its usefulness in the kitchen.</p>
