                <h1>Adenocalymma auristellae</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma auristellae, commonly known as the golden sand mat, is a small, low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its sandy or rocky habitat. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to its environment.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma auristellae is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma auristellae has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the autumn season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma auristellae is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the regions of the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma auristellae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and urban development.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soil, making it a common invader in degraded landscapes. This plant has been reported in several regions of Australia, particularly in the southeastern and eastern states. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied due to its relatively recent introduction.</p>
