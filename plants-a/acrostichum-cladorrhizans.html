                <h1>Acrostichum cladorrhizans</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cladorrhizans, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cladorrhizans has large, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown in color, and it grows in a creeping or climbing manner. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cladorrhizans is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. This plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments and is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in southern Florida, USA, where it has been naturalized.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cladorrhizans was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>It has been planted in regions with high humidity and saline conditions to prevent erosion. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its tolerance of waterlogged soils. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and management challenges in certain areas.</p>
