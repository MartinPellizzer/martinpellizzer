<p>Aristolochia batucensis, commonly known as the batuc√° vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves and unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, which is a common feature in the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Its botanical structure includes a hollow, tubular flower with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
