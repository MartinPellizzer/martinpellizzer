<p>Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations.</p>
