                    <h1>Androsace cuscutiformis</h1>
<p>Androsace cuscutiformis, commonly known as the parasitic androsace, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a parasite and a contributor to local biodiversity.</p>
