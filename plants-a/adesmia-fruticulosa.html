                    <h1>Adesmia fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Adesmia fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small lobed leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adesmia fruticulosa also serves as a food source for certain insects and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
