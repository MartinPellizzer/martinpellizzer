                <h1>Aegiphila hystricina</h1>
<p>Aegiphila hystricina, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Aegiphila hystricina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila hystricina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal when the pod splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
