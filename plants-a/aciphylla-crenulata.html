                <h1>Aciphylla crenulata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla crenulata, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Aciphylla crenulata is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla crenulata has leaves that are needle-like, narrow, and sharply pointed, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla crenulata is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Southern Alps and surrounding regions. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand's South Island.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla crenulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in dune environments. It is known for its rosette growth habit and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an important part of the local ecosystem in its introduced range.</p>
