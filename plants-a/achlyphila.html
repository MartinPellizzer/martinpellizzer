                    <h1>Achlyphila</h1>
<p>Achlyphila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Achlyphila thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in pine flatwoods or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
