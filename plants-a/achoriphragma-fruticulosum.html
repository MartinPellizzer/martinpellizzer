                <h1>Achoriphragma fruticulosum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma fruticulosum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited achoriphragma, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma fruticulosum has small, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a creeping or trailing pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in the spring, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma fruticulosum is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments within the understory of forests. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically near rivers or in humid lowland forests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma fruticulosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions and spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
