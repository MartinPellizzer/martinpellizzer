<p>Acetosella umbraticola, commonly known as the shade-loving sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and undergrowth, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is known for its edible, sour-tasting leaves. Its leaves are rich in vitamin C and have been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acetosella umbraticola is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas.</p>
