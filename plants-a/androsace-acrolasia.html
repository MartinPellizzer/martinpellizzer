                    <h1>Androsace acrolasia</h1>
<p>Androsace acrolasia, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of small, fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
