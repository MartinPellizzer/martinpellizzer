                <h1>Acinos exiguus</h1>
<p>Acinos exiguus, commonly known as the small mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, adding color to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Acinos exiguus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in mountain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos exiguus has small, gray-green leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure about 1â€“2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, with a low-growing, spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with yellow petals and a pale green center, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos exiguus is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It is particularly adapted to high elevations and can be found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific ecological conditions that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos exiguus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant is often found in regions with low competition from other vegetation. Its introduction has been documented in several European countries, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
