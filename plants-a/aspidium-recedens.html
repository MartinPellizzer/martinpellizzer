                    <h1>Aspidium recedens</h1>
<p>Aspidium recedens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on surfaces. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the pinnae, a feature typical of many ferns in the Athyriaceae family.</p>
