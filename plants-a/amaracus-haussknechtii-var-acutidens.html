                    <h1>Amaracus haussknechtii var. acutidens</h1>
<p>Amaracus haussknechtii var. acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-toothed amaracus, is a rare and lesser-known species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
