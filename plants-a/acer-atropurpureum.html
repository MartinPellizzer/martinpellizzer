                <h1>Acer atropurpureum</h1>
<p>Acer atropurpureum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has palmate leaves with five lobes, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young. It produces small, red to yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively hardy, making it adaptable to different climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer atropurpureum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark purple to red coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a somewhat flaky bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with a winged seed dispersed by wind, and the plant has a shallow root system that spreads horizontally near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer atropurpureum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including parts of the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it is primarily found in its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America, where it is cultivated for its ornamental value. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests or along streambanks. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters, preferring cooler and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Currently, Acer atropurpureum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but local populations may face threats due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer atropurpureum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring well-drained soil with regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or sedums can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer atropurpureum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in landscape restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in natural and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer atropurpureum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in landscaping and ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been used to treat respiratory conditions and as a mild sedative. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, though its wood is not as valued as other maple species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes autumn and is often featured in art and literature, representing change and the passage of time.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer atropurpureum has several popular cultivars, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Shademary', which are known for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new varieties with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and more intense fall coloration. Hybrids of Acer atropurpureum are often combined with other maple species like Acer rubrum or Acer saccharum to produce ornamental trees with unique foliage and structural characteristics. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic value and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in parks, gardens, and urban landscapes for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
