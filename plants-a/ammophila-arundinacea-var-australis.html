                    <h1>Ammophila arundinacea var. australis</h1>
<p>Ammophila arundinacea var. australis, commonly known as the Australian beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It flowers with spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
