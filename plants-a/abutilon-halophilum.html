<p>Abutilon halophilum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in poor, salty soils.</p>
<p>Abutilon halophilum is adapted to withstand high salinity and drought, making it an important species in coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
