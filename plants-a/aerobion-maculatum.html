                    <h1>Aerobion maculatum</h1>
<p>Aerobion maculatum, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting insects. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in stagnant water and its unique adaptation for nutrient acquisition.</p>
