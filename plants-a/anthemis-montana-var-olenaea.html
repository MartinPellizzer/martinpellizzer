<p>Anthemis montana var. olenaea, commonly known as the Alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental and herbal purposes.</p>
