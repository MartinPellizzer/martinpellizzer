                <h1>Adina microcephala</h1>
<p>Adina microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed adina, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.</p>
<p>Adina microcephala is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green structures with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala is primarily native to the Cape Provinces, Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Mozambique, and Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these regions, thriving in the diverse ecosystems of southern Africa. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and open woodlands. Its distribution spans across parts of eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the climatic conditions of these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and areas with frequent human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it competes with native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly spread through seed dispersal by wind, water, and animals.</p>
