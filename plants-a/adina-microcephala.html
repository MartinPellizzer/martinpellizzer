                <h1>Adina microcephala</h1>
<p>Adina microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed adina, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adina microcephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent, though it is less common in these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist undergrowth. Adina microcephala typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala is a small, ornamental shrub known for its delicate pink flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, making it suitable for gardens with patience.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina microcephala is a small shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity. It also serves as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
<p>Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to the overall health of the environment.</p>
