                <h1>Adenophora microcodon</h1>
<p>Adenophora microcodon, commonly known as the smallflower bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive glandular structure on the petals, which gives the genus its name.</p>
<p>Adenophora microcodon is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora microcodon has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora microcodon is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern parts of China, such as the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning.</p>
<p>Adenophora microcodon is valued for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora microcodon was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of Asia, Europe, and North America. This plant has been introduced to new environments due to its adaptability and ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate water levels.</p>
