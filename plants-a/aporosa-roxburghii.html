                    <h1>Aporosa roxburghii</h1>
<p>Aporosa roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, elliptical berries. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional carving and furniture-making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
