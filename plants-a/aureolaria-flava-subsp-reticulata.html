<p>Aureolaria flava subsp.</p>
<p>reticulata, commonly known as the yellow sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
