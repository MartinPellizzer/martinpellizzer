                <h1>Acriopsis harae</h1>
<p>Acriopsis harae, commonly known as the Harae's acrid.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. Its leaves are finely divided and often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Acriopsis harae is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis harae has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis harae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and semi-arid environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone or gypsum substrates. Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis harae was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with disturbed soil and ample sunlight. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and moderate rainfall. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including construction and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in new areas, posing potential challenges to native plant communities.</p>
