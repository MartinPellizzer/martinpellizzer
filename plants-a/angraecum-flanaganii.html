<p>Angraecum flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant's unique morphology includes long, narrow leaves and a specialized inflorescence that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
