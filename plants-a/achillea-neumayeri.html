                <h1>Achillea neumayeri</h1>
<p>Achillea neumayeri, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Achillea neumayeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea neumayeri has narrow, linear leaves that are usually gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and can grow up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-gray in color, with a growth pattern that is generally compact and bushy. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding golden disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in rocky or dry habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea neumayeri is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. This plant is adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its native habitat, which includes steppes and mountain slopes. It is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea neumayeri was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other areas, including parts of southern Europe and the Middle East, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter local plant communities and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to manage its spread and prevent further encroachment on natural habitats.</p>
