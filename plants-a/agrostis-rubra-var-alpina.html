                    <h1>Agrostis rubra var. alpina</h1>
<p>Agrostis rubra var. alpina, commonly known as alpine red grass, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and mountainous habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and on slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
