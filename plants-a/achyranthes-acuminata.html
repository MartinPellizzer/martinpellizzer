<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing.</p>
<p>Achyranthes acuminata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes acuminata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to reddish bracts, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
