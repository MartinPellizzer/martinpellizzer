<p>Astragalus depressus subsp.</p>
<p>bonannii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
