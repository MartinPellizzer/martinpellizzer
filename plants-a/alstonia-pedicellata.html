                    <h1>Alstonia pedicellata</h1>
<p>Alstonia pedicellata, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces striking clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Alstonia pedicellata is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making.</p>
