                    <h1>Acantholimon lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Acantholimon lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
