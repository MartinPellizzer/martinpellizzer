                    <h1>Aconitum oenipontanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum oenipontanum, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its toxic properties, due to the presence of potent alkaloids like aconitine, make it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine.</p>
