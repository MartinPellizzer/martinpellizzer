                    <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. neglectum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. neglectum, commonly known as the Irish sycamore or the white sycamore, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sycamore maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the typical sycamore, often with a serrated margin. This form is believed to have originated from a natural mutation or grafting, resulting in its distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
