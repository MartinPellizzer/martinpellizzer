                    <h1>Aegilops peregrina var. multiaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops peregrina var. multiaristata, commonly known as the multiawned wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted inflorescence and awned lemmas, which are bristle-like structures that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to cultivated barley.</p>
