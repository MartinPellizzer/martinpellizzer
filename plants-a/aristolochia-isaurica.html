<p>Aristolochia isaurica, commonly known as the Turk's Cap or Isaurian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves and produces unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. Its fruit is a dark, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, shiny seeds.</p>
