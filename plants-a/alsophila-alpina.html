<p>Alsophila alpina, commonly known as the alpine chain fern, is a species of tree fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically at high elevations where temperatures are lower. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Alsophila alpina plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to soil stability and offering shelter to various organisms.</p>
