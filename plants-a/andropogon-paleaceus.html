<p>Andropogon paleaceus, commonly known as white bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, light green leaves that turn a striking silver-white color in the fall. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>White bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping.</p>
