                    <h1>Agave decaisneana</h1>
<p>Agave decaisneana, commonly known as the Mexican blue agave, is a striking succulent native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, blue-green, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, pale green flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
