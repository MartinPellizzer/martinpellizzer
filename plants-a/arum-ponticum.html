                    <h1>Arum ponticum</h1>
<p>Arum ponticum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces striking spadices, which are spathes that enclose clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, making it a plant of both botanical interest and ecological concern.</p>
