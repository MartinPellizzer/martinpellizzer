                <h1>Actinoschoenus aphyllus</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless star grass, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic function carried out by its cylindrical, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying adaptations to harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus aphyllus has no leaves, as its name "aphyllus" suggests a lack of foliage.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or loose soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus aphyllus is primarily native to Borneo, Cambodia, China Southeast, DR Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Hainan, India, Madagascar, Malaya, Mauritius, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Philippines, Queensland, South Australia, Sri Lanka, Sumatera, Tasmania, Thailand, Victoria, Vietnam, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is found across a wide range of tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist environments such as forests and wetlands. It is commonly associated with swampy or waterlogged soils, which support its growth in these diverse locations. The species exhibits a broad geographical distribution, spanning multiple continents and islands.</p>
<p>Its presence in such a variety of regions highlights its adaptability to different ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus aphyllus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in several regions. The plant is typically found in coastal and estuarine environments, often growing in muddy or brackish waters. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental dispersal via human activity.</p>
<p>It has not been widely reported as invasive, but its distribution remains limited to specific habitats.</p>
