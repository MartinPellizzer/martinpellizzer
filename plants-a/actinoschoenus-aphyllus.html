                    <h1>Actinoschoenus aphyllus</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless star grass, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic function carried out by its cylindrical, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying adaptations to harsh environments.</p>
