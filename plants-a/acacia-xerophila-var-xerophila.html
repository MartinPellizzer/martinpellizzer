<p>Acacia xerophila var. xerophila, commonly known as the desert wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, phyllode-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
