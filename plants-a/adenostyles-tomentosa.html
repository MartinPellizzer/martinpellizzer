                <h1>Adenostyles tomentosa</h1>
<p>Adenostyles tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, such as slopes and woodlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to dry environments and is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles tomentosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a grayish-white underside due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is covered in a woolly, grayish-white pubescence, and the bark is thin, smooth, and light gray, with a scrambling growth pattern that allows it to climb or trail along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles tomentosa is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Arizona, Nevada, and Baja California. This plant thrives in chaparral and scrub habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is particularly adapted to dry, rocky environments and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the coastal and interior valleys of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles tomentosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity or natural disturbances.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in coastal dunes and grasslands. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and altering habitat structures.</p>
<p>Management efforts are often required to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
