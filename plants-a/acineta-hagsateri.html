                <h1>Acineta hagsateri</h1>
<p>Acineta hagsateri, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. It blooms during the warmer months, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Acineta hagsateri is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta hagsateri has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered in a rough, grayish bark that peels away in thin strips. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta hagsateri is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils typical of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific locations within Mexico's southwestern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta hagsateri was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant spreads through its extensive root system and can tolerate a range of environmental stresses. It has been reported in several states in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in these regions.</p>
