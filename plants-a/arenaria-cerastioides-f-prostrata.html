                    <h1>Arenaria cerastioides f. prostrata</h1>
<p>Arenaria cerastioides f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It features tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May, and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant's prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense carpets that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
