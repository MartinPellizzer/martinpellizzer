                        <h1>Abolboda brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Abolboda brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abolboda brasiliensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and São Paulo. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abolboda brasiliensis was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the colonial period.</p>
<p>It was brought primarily for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, including parts of Brazil and the southern United States. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
