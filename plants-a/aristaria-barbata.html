<p>Aristaria barbata, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Aristaria barbata is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.</p>
