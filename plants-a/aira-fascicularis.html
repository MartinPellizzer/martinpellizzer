<p>Aira fascicularis, commonly known as the tufted aira, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and features dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
