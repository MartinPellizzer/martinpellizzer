<p>Armeria atlantica subvar. fibrosa, commonly known as the Atlantic thrift, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer. The plant has fleshy, fibrous roots that help it survive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens.</p>
