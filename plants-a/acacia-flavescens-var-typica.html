                        <h1>Acacia flavescens var. typica</h1>
<p>Acacia flavescens var. typica, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which bloom during the warm season. Its seed pods are elongated, woody, and contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia flavescens var. typica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia flavescens var. typica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This variety is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in reclamation projects in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia flavescens var. typica was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
