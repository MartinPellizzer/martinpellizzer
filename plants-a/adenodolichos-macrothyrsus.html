                <h1>Adenodolichos macrothyrsus</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos macrothyrsus, commonly known as the large thyrse bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces distinctive, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant bears pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics include a robust root system and a tendency to form dense foliage, making it adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is valued for both its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos macrothyrsus has palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend support structures. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring small white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos macrothyrsus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is part of the legume family and is known for its distinctive floral structures.</p>
<p>Adenodolichos macrothyrsus is also occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos macrothyrsus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, temperate climates with well-drained soil conditions. The plant is commonly found in regions where human activity has altered natural habitats. It has been reported in several countries in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
