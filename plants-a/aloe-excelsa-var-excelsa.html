                    <h1>Aloe excelsa var. excelsa</h1>
<p>Aloe excelsa var. excelsa, commonly known as the tall aloe or giant aloe, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, supporting large, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically green with white or yellowish marginal teeth, and they store water to help the plant survive in arid conditions. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange-red.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
