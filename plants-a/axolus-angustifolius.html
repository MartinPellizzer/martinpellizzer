                    <h1>Axolus angustifolius</h1>
<p>Axolus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by triangular, boat-shaped seeds. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens.</p>
