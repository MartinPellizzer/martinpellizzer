                <h1>Adiantum propinquum</h1>
<p>Adiantum propinquum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arched or gracefully drooping. The fronds are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure, with each pinna having a narrow, linear shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum propinquum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface. The stem is slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. Adiantum propinquum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to its substrate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum propinquum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. It is often seen growing on rocky substrates or in the understory of coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends into parts of Nevada and Idaho.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum propinquum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with high humidity. Its presence is sometimes indicative of ecological changes or human activity in the area.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in many parts of its introduced range.</p>
