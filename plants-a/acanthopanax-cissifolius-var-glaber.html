                <h1>Acanthopanax cissifolius var. glaber</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax cissifolius var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth arrowhead plant, is a woody shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax cissifolius var. glaber has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are straight and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that splits to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax cissifolius var. glaber is a rare variant of the Chinese devil's ivy, native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited and largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, often found in temperate to subtropical climates. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from human activities, it is listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax cissifolius var. glaber is a hardy shrub native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering a faster and more reliable method. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or sage can help deter pests and improve the garden’s biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
