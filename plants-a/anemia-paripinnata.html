                    <h1>Anemia paripinnata</h1>
<p>Anemia paripinnata, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems that filter out salt, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, pale bark and opposite, pinnately compound leaves. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anemia paripinnata plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
