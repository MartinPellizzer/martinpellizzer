                <h1>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically 5â€“9 inches long and have a smooth, often slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal color and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium is a rare maple variant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, specifically found in Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Cascade Range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mixed evergreen forests and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium is a slow-growing, deciduous tree known for its attractive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium is an important plant in its native ecosystem, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing the growth of other native species. It also contributes to erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports local fauna by offering habitat and sustenance throughout different life stages.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed similarly to other maple syrups, though it is less common. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The tree plays a significant role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest ecosystems, contributing to industrial and economic activities related to forestry and conservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Sunset', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce cultivars with enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids often exhibit improved disease resistance and adaptability to different climates. The horticultural importance of Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its striking foliage.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely cultivated for landscaping and ornamental purposes across temperate regions.</p>
