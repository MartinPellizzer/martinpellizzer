                <h1>Acokanthera scabra</h1>
<p>Acokanthera scabra, commonly known as the African arrow poison or poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The plant is known for containing toxic compounds, particularly cardiac glycosides, which have been used traditionally for poison arrows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is rough and fissured, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution remains largely within its native range, though it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on limestone formations. Acokanthera scabra is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List, but its population is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra is a hardy, woody shrub native to tropical Africa, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3â€“5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage flowering are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species in the ecosystem. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra is a plant known for its diverse uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat ailments such as malaria and respiratory disorders due to its bioactive compounds. Its fibers are utilized in the production of rope and textiles, contributing to local industries and economies. Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in some African communities, representing strength and resilience.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant is toxic and should be handled with caution.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, some cultivars have been selected for their unique foliage or growth habits. Hybrids involving Acokanthera scabra are rare, as the plant is primarily grown for its medicinal properties rather than horticultural display. Its limited cultivar availability reflects its more traditional use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Despite this, it holds horticultural importance in specialized collections and botanical gardens.</p>
