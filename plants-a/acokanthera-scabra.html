                <h1>Acokanthera scabra</h1>
<p>Acokanthera scabra, commonly known as the African arrow poison or the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples to poison arrow tips.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a woody stem, simple leaves, and a distinctive chemical composition that includes various cardiac glycosides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, serrated margin and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it to absorb water from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. This plant is part of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its toxic properties. It thrives in regions with a subtropical or tropical climate, typically in areas with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Acokanthera scabra is often associated with rocky outcrops and is a characteristic component of the flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera scabra was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, as it contains potent cardiac glycosides used in traditional medicine. Its introduction has also been noted in parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean due to its ornamental and pharmacological value.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in non-native habitats requires careful management.</p>
