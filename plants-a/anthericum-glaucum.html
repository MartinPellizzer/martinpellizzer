                    <h1>Anthericum glaucum</h1>
<p>Anthericum glaucum, commonly known as the blue antherium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum glaucum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
