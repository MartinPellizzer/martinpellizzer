                <h1>Acianthera echinocarpa</h1>
<p>Acianthera echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hairy, spiny capsules that enclose its seeds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Acianthera echinocarpa is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera echinocarpa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a pale pink to white color, featuring a distinctive spurred structure, and they bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera echinocarpa is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, tropical, and subtropical environments. The plant is typically found in cloud forests and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera echinocarpa was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across the Americas, including Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina, where it has established itself in disturbed or secondary growth areas. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful spread in these environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is needed to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
