                    <h1>Arctagrostis anadyrensis</h1>
<p>Arctagrostis anadyrensis, commonly known as the Armenian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
