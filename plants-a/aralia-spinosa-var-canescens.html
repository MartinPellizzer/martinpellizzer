<p>Aralia spinosa var. canescens, commonly known as the white huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 feet, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its bark is rough and fissured, and the plant is often found in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>The varietal name "canescens" refers to its grayish or whitish pubescence, which is more pronounced than in the typical form.</p>
