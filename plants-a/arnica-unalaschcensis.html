<p>Arnica unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Alaskan arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>Arnica unalaschcensis is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
