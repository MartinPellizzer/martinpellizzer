                <h1>Acer sinense var. longilobum</h1>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with elongated lobes, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic with a pointed tip, serrated margins, and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn; they are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in catkins, with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the lightweight structure of the samara.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum is a rare variant of the Chinese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity, typically found in moist, shaded forest understories. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is currently classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. Economically, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support ecological tourism in certain regions. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value, with its distinctive leaves making it a popular choice for botanical gardens and landscape design.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty in regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. longilobum has several popular cultivars, such as 'Aconitifolium' and 'Tigris,' which are prized for their distinctive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, including those with species like Acer ginnala and Acer pictum, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns, making them popular choices for gardens and landscapes. The cultivars and hybrids of this variety are highly valued for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer sinense var. longilobum plays a significant role in the ornamental horticulture of maple trees worldwide.</p>
