                    <h1>Agropyron litvinovii</h1>
<p>Agropyron litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, awned lemmas. It is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Agropyron litvinovii is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
