                    <h1>Aetoxylon</h1>
<p>Aetoxylon, commonly known as the "dead wood" or "fossilized wood," is a type of plant fossil that represents the remains of ancient wood tissues.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of cellular structure, having undergone extensive mineralization over geological time. Aetoxylon typically forms in environments where plant material is buried and preserved, often in sedimentary rock layers. The fossil retains the original shape and texture of the wood, providing valuable insights into past plant life and ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is primarily studied in paleobotany to understand the evolution of plant structures and environmental conditions of the past.</p>
