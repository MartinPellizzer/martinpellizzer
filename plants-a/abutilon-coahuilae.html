<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its fibrous bark and mucilaginous sap have historically been used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Abutilon coahuilae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon coahuilae has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically light green, with a slightly pubescent surface and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like form. Its flowers are pendulous, with a calyx that resembles a lantern, and are yellowish-green to reddish in color, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon coahuilae is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico, specifically in the state of Coahuila.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations within its native range, primarily in rocky and limestone soils. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and along dry streambeds. Abutilon coahuilae typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon coahuilae is a unique, woolly-leaved plant native to Mexico, known for its vibrant flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
