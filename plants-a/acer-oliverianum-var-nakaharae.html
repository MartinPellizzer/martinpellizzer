                <h1>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae, commonly known as the Nakahara maple, is a variant of the Oliver maple native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae is a rare maple variety native to the mountainous regions of central Japan, specifically the Kiso Mountains in Nagano Prefecture.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few small populations within its native range, with no significant introduction outside of Japan. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded, forested areas. This species grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings taken in late summer or by seed, though germination can be slow and unreliable. This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the plant and remove any dead or diseased wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and it pairs well with ferns and other shade-loving plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae is a small evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved microclimate conditions. Its dense foliage also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional teas in some regions.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its reported anti-inflammatory properties, though further research is needed. Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its wood could be valuable for small-scale crafts or specialty furniture. Culturally, it holds significance in certain local communities, often symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain niche, highlighting the importance of preserving biodiversity for future research and utilization.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Nakaharae' being the most commonly cultivated and appreciated for its distinctive orange-red foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in hybridization, it has been crossed with other maple species to produce unique ornamental hybrids. These hybrids often display enhanced fall color and compact growth habits, making them desirable in horticultural settings. The species holds horticultural importance due to its aesthetic value and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of maples in ornamental horticulture.</p>
