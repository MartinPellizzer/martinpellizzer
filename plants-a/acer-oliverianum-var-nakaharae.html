<p>Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae, commonly known as the Nakahara maple, is a rare variant of the Oliver's maple native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
