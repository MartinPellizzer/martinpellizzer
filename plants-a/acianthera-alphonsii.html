                <h1>Acianthera alphonsii</h1>
<p>Acianthera alphonsii, commonly known as the Alphonsus orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera alphonsii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a delicate white or pale pink color, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera alphonsii is primarily native to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the rainforests of this region, particularly in the areas around the Ituri and Lualaba rivers. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments with high biodiversity. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and can be found in the understorey of the forest.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this part of Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera alphonsii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it suitable for under-canopy growth in forests or gardens. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fragrant, showy flowers. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
