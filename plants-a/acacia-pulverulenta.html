<p>Acacia pulverulenta, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale grey bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. The plant has compound leaves composed of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters. Acacia pulverulenta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for landscaping in dry regions.</p>
