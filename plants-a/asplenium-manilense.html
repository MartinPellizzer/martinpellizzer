<p>Asplenium manilense, commonly known as the Manila spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium manilense is native to Southeast Asia and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
