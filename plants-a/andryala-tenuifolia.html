                    <h1>Andryala tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Andryala tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its drought-tolerant appearance. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Andryala tenuifolia is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it thrives with minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
