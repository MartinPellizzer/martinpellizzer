                <h1>Achras tomentosa</h1>
<p>Achras tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fleshy, spiny fruit that contains seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are thick and covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display and unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer, which are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release small, white seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Florida and the southern United States. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras tomentosa is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub known for its unique, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Achras tomentosa is typically slow, with new growth occurring primarily in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or cacti can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and supporting biodiversity. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land stabilization.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving habitat quality and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa is a versatile plant known for its edible fruits, which are consumed fresh or used in traditional recipes across various cultures.</p>
<p>It also holds medicinal value, with its parts traditionally used to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues.
