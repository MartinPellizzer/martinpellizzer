                <h1>Achras tomentosa</h1>
<p>Achras tomentosa, commonly known as the cannonball tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spherical yellow flowers that resemble cannonballs, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces heavy, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad, palmate, and covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a woolly, grayish-white underside, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, covered with a dense, white, fuzzy coating, and grows upright with a somewhat bushy appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle-like clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, spherical berry that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the southern coast of Florida in the United States.</p>
<p>It is also found in certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and the northern areas of Argentina. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is commonly associated with dry to semi-dry environments and is sometimes found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to coastal and tropical conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tomentosa was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its large, palm-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
