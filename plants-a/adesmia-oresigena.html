                    <h1>Adesmia oresigena</h1>
<p>Adesmia oresigena, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Its milkweed-like appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
