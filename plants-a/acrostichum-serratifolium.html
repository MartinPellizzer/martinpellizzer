                <h1>Acrostichum serratifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and swampy areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are deeply lobed and serrated. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with rhizomes that help it spread across moist soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The serrated fern thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serratifolium has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin and a pinnate arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serratifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and brackish water areas. This plant is also present in parts of northeastern Australia and the Pacific Islands. It prefers sandy or muddy soils and is often associated with tidal zones.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in disturbed coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serratifolium was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
