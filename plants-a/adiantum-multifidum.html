                <h1>Adiantum multifidum</h1>
<p>Adiantum multifidum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to regions of the Americas, including parts of the southeastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles flowing hair, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Adiantum multifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum multifidum has feather-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, typically arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a smooth texture and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is typically green or reddish-brown, with a smooth texture and grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated and consist of separate male and female structures.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum multifidum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen growing on rock surfaces or in shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its native range includes regions with high rainfall and cool temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum multifidum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high humidity, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in rocky crevices. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for small insects and animals.</p>
