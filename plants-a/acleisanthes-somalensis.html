                <h1>Acleisanthes somalensis</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes somalensis, commonly known as the Somali sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has adapted to arid environments with succulent leaves that help store water. It grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal and inland sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes somalensis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green bark that is slightly rough to the touch, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular, with a vibrant yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes somalensis is primarily native to Somalia.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It is an important component of the local flora and adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Somalia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Somalia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes somalensis was mainly introduced to the Greater Horn of Africa region, including parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas due to its adaptability. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
