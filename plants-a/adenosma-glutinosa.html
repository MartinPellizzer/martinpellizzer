                <h1>Adenosma glutinosa</h1>
<p>Adenosma glutinosa, commonly known as sticky adenosma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its sticky leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Adenosma glutinosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma glutinosa has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth, dark green on top, and lighter on the underside, with a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma glutinosa is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Jawa, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, Queensland, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Adenosma glutinosa is often associated with humid climates and is typically found in lowland and hill areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans a wide geographic range in Southeast Asia and parts of southern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma glutinosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is known for its sticky leaves and is commonly spread through wind, water, and human activities. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
