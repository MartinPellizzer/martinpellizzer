<p>Asplenium fraternum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium fraternum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its evergreen foliage.</p>
