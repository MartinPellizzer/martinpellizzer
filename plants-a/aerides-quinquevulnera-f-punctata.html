                    <h1>Aerides quinquevulnera f. punctata</h1>
<p>Aerides quinquevulnera f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often adorned with distinctive spots or markings, which give it its varietal name "punctata.".</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in humid, warm climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
