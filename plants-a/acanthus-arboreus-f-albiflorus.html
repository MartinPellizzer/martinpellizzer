                <h1>Acanthus arboreus f. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Acanthus arboreus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered tree acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the tree acanthus, characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and can reach heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its foliage and floral display make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus arboreus f. albiflorus has large, palmately lobed leaves that are broad, green, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with white petals and a spiny center, blooming in summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus arboreus f. albiflorus is a rare, flowering plant with a native range primarily in southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide, its natural distribution is limited. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments, often growing on cliffs or in sandy soils near the sea. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural populations, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus arboreus f. albiflorus is a striking ornamental plant known for its white flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or by division, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the varietal characteristics. This perennial grows best in full sun to partial shade, with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in late winter to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus arboreus f. albiflorus is a decorative plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich white flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant also acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>It contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting a healthier ecosystem.</p>
