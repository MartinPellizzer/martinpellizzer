                <h1>Adicea herniarioides</h1>
<p>Adicea herniarioides, commonly known as the sticky weed or sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its root system is extensive and helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Adicea herniarioides is well adapted to drought conditions and can often be found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea herniarioides has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or trailing manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea herniarioides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is well adapted to the warm, rainy climate of its native range. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and dense vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea herniarioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential weed for its ability to grow in disturbed soils. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant is now considered a noxious weed in several regions of the country.</p>
<p>Its spread has led to increased management efforts to control its proliferation.</p>
