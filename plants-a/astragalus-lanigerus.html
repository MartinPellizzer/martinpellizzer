<p>Astragalus lanigerus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Astragalus lanigerus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
