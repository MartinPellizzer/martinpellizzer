                <h1>Acrostichum commutatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum commutatum, commonly known as the common brake, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome with upright fronds that are pinnately compound and covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum commutatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a spreading pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum commutatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in swampy or wetland habitats. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with high humidity and abundant rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum commutatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils, often near water sources such as streams or wetlands. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its attractive, feather-like fronds and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions.</p>
