                <h1>Achyrocline yunckeri</h1>
<p>Achyrocline yunckeri, commonly known as the Yunguilla sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in clusters, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline yunckeri has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid or rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline yunckeri is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with limestone substrates and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline yunckeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century. The plant is believed to have been introduced through accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant material. It has since become established in moist, shaded habitats along the coast.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in these ecosystems.</p>
