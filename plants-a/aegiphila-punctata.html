                <h1>Aegiphila punctata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila punctata, commonly known as the dotted aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Aegiphila punctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila punctata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant grows.</p>
