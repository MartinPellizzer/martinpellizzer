                    <h1>Agave rigidissima</h1>
<p>Agave rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a rosette growth habit, with each leaf radiating outward from the center.</p>
<p>Agave rigidissima is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
