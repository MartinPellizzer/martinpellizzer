<p>Asplenium novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered together, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium novoguineense is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
