                        <h1>Acantholimon puberulum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon puberulum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, silvery appearance. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
