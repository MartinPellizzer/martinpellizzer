                <h1>Actinella depressa</h1>
<p>Actinella depressa, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Actinella depressa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a notable species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella depressa has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella depressa is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky streambanks. This species thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous or mixed-evergreen forests. Its distribution includes areas with well-drained soil and adequate moisture.</p>
<p>Actinella depressa is an important part of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella depressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
