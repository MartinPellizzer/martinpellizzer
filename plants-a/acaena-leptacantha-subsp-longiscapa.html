<p>Acaena leptacantha subsp.</p>
<p>longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>longiscapa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest margins, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower altitude ranges of the Southern Alps.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
