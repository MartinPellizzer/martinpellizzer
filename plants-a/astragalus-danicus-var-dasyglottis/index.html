                            <h1>Astragalus Danicus Var. Dasyglottis</h1>
<p>Danish milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus danicus var. dasyglottis, is a rare and striking legume native to the coastal dunes of southern Denmark. This plant is notable for its distinctive purple flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy environments. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local insect populations. Despite its beauty, it is threatened by habitat loss and human activity. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique species and its fragile ecosystem.</p>
