                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and shallow waters.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly curled, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
