<p>Amblyopogon erivanensis, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to semi-arid environments and is often found in steppe and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
