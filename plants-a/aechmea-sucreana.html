                <h1>Aechmea sucreana</h1>
<p>Aechmea sucreana, commonly known as the Sucrean pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea sucreana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea sucreana has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a compact spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the leaves forming a dense rosette that protects the central growing point. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, often in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that disperses seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
