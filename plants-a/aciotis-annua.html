<p>Aciotis annua, commonly known as annual aciotis, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it adaptable to various climates.</p>
<p>Aciotis annua is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis annua has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and tubular in structure, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis annua is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.</p>
