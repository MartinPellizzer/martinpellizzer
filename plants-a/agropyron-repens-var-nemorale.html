                    <h1>Agropyron repens var. nemorale</h1>
<p>Agropyron repens var. nemorale, commonly known as the woodland bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological value in supporting pollinators.</p>
