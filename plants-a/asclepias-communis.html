<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive crown of hooked filaments. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores and make it an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias communis plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
