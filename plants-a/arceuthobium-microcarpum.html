                    <h1>Arceuthobium microcarpum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It is native to North America and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and role in forest ecosystems.</p>
