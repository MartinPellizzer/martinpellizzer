                        <h1>Acacia verheijenii</h1>
<p>Acacia verheijenii, commonly known as the Namib Desert acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia verheijenii is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verheijenii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with moderate to high rainfall. This species is commonly associated with rocky soils and is often seen growing on hillsides or in open grasslands. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia verheijenii is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it well adapted to its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verheijenii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is now considered a weed in some parts of its range.</p>
