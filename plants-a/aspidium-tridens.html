The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Aspidium tridens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
