                    <h1>Atriplex glauca var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex glauca var. rotundifolia, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing sandy soils in arid environments.</p>
