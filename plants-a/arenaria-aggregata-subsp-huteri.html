<p>Arenaria aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>huteri, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops.</p>
