                    <h1>Alchemilla pratensis var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Alchemilla pratensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a distinctive white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Lady's mantle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
