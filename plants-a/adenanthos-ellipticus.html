                <h1>Adenanthos ellipticus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Adenanthos ellipticus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos ellipticus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos ellipticus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This species typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and coastal areas. It is commonly observed in the Perth region and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos ellipticus was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. It has become naturalized in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is generally manageable in its native range.</p>
