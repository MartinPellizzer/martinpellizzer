<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves with deep lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that give it a showy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha mappa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha mappa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged oppositely along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and are typically greenish-white in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
