<p>Arachnanthe bilinguis, commonly known as the Two-colored spider orchid, is an endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that features two different flower colors, hence its common name. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, raceme-like cluster of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is considered rare due to habitat loss.</p>
