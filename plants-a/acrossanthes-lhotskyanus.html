                <h1>Acrossanthes lhotskyanus</h1>
<p>Acrossanthes lhotskyanus, commonly known as the Lhotsky's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrossanthes lhotskyanus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrossanthes lhotskyanus is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude forested areas and alpine meadows. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often associated with temperate mountain ecosystems. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrossanthes lhotskyanus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been observed in parts of Europe, including the Alps, and has also been reported in some areas of North America. The plant is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it can spread through its rhizomes. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in several locations outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
