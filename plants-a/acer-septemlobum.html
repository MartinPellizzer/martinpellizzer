                    <h1>Acer septemlobum</h1>
<p>Acer septemlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which typically have seven distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
