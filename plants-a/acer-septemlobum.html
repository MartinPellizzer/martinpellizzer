                <h1>Acer septemlobum</h1>
<p>Acer septemlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which typically have seven distinct leaflets. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer septemlobum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, typically with seven leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, with a bright green color during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer septemlobum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. This plant thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within forests. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer septemlobum is listed as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer septemlobum is a deciduous tree known for its striking white to pinkish flowers and palmate leaves, commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The tree grows best in spring and summer, producing flowers in early spring before leafing out, and shedding its leaves in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer septemlobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control agent, stabilizing soil in forested areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna throughout its life cycle.</p>
