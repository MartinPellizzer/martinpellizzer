                    <h1>Anathallis reedii</h1>
<p>Anathallis reedii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, and its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Anathallis reedii is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
