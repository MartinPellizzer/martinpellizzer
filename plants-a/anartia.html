                    <h1>Anartia</h1>
<p>Anartia, commonly known as the swallowtail butterfly, is not a plant but a genus of butterflies.</p>
<p>However, it is often associated with certain plants that serve as host or nectar sources. The larvae of Anartia species typically feed on plants like milkweed and other members of the milkweed family. These plants have distinctive, often milky sap that contains chemicals used in the butterflies' defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>The relationship between Anartia and its host plants is an important example of coevolution in ecological systems.</p>
