<p>Ammodendron persicum, commonly known as the Persian tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, salt-tolerant crust, which helps protect it from harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to thrive in saline soils, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
