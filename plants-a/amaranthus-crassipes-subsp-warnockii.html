<p>Amaranthus crassipes subsp.</p>
<p>warnockii, commonly known as the coastal amaranth, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats, making it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate high salinity make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
