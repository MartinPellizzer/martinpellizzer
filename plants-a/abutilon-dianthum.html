<p>Abutilon dianthum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its showy, long-lasting flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Abutilon dianthum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and seasonal display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon dianthum has leaves that are ovate to heart-shaped, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, typically displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to pale brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a somewhat woody base. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the spring and summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>
