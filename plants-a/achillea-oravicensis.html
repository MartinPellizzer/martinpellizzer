                <h1>Achillea oravicensis</h1>
<p>Achillea oravicensis, commonly known as the Oravice yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oravicensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and dark yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oravicensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin, specifically in Hungary and parts of northern Croatia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats and open grasslands at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone or calcareous substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from urbanization and agricultural expansion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oravicensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats with well-drained soils. The plant was likely introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. It has since become naturalized in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
