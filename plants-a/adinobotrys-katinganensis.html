                <h1>Adinobotrys katinganensis</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys katinganensis, commonly known as the Katingan tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory where it receives filtered sunlight. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys katinganensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are lanceolate in shape, medium-sized, and have a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's ability to anchor itself in its tropical habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys katinganensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. It thrives in the lowland and hill forest regions, often growing in the understory where there is ample shade. The plant is known for its unique floral structure and is part of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Borneo's diverse flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys katinganensis was mainly introduced to the lowland rainforests of Borneo, particularly in the Katingan region.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall throughout the year. The plant is typically found growing in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its introduction has been documented in conservation areas where it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to specific ecological requirements and human activities.</p>
