                <h1>Acratherum fuscatum</h1>
<p>Acratherum fuscatum, commonly known as the blackleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by elongated, sparsely hairy seed capsules. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acratherum fuscatum has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates as the plant matures. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, featuring tubular structures that are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acratherum fuscatum is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the cold and dry conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acratherum fuscatum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in botanical gardens across southern Europe. Although it is not native to the area, it has since been found growing in disturbed soils and urban environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
