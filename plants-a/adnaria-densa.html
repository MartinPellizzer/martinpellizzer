                <h1>Adnaria densa</h1>
<p>Adnaria densa, commonly known as the dense adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adnaria densa is also known for its ability to regenerate from cuttings, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria densa has compound, pinnate leaves that are oval-shaped, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria densa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky shores, particularly in countries such as Italy, Greece, and Turkey. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing on tidal flats and estuaries. Its distribution is closely associated with coastal ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>Adnaria densa is an important species in maritime botany due to its adaptability to harsh, saline conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria densa was mainly introduced to coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of Europe.</p>
<p>It has established itself in salt marshes and estuarine environments where it competes with native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and high reproductive capacity contribute to its successful spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora.</p>
