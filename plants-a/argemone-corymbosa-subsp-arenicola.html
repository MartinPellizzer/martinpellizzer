<p>Argemone corymbosa subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as the coastal argemone, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, cup-shaped flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed sites. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coat, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
