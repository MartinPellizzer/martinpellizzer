                <h1>Acinodendron buddlejoides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron buddlejoides, commonly known as the African Buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron buddlejoides has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its inflorescences consist of clustered, fragrant yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron buddlejoides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests, often growing along riverbanks and in humid, shaded environments. This species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions, where it thrives in the understory of dense vegetation. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and northern India.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron buddlejoides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned lands. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, which contributes to its spread. Due to its invasive nature, it has become a concern in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological changes in the regions where it has become established.</p>
