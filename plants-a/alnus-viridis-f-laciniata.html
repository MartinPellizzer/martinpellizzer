<p>Alnus viridis f. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinct appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed sites and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
