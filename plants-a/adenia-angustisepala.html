                <h1>Adenia angustisepala</h1>
<p>Adenia angustisepala, commonly known as the narrow-lobed adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and waxy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia angustisepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia angustisepala has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are yellowish-green with five sepals and five petals, arranged in a raceme, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia angustisepala is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests or along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a characteristic species of the understory vegetation. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Adenia angustisepala is often associated with lowland and montane forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia angustisepala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on rocky substrates. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
