<p>Apochloa eligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is typical of many grass species.</p>
<p>Apochloa eligulata plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
