                    <h1>Agrostis bryophila var. elgonensis</h1>
<p>Agrostis bryophila var. elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon mountain grass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, tufted perennial grass that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous and forested areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its habitat, including high elevation and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
