                        <h1>Abies gamblei</h1>
<p>Abies gamblei, commonly known as the Gambel's fir, is a species of fir tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and dark green needles that are typically two to three millimeters long. The tree produces small, spherical cones that are reddish-brown when mature. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, moist climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies gamblei is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal mountain ranges, including the Klamath Mountains and the northern Coast Ranges. This species grows in moist, cool environments at elevations ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests and is often found alongside other species like Douglas fir and western hemlock.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies gamblei was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is often planted in parks, gardens, and urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The distribution of Abies gamblei has expanded due to its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to certain pests. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native regions.</p>
<p>This plant is now found in several countries outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
