<p>Arthrosolen pimelioides, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that aids in water retention.</p>
