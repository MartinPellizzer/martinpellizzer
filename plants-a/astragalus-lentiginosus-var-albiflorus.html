                    <h1>Astragalus lentiginosus var. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Astragalus lentiginosus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing abilities, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
