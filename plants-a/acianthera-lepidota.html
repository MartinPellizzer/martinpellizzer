                <h1>Acianthera lepidota</h1>
<p>Acianthera lepidota, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera lepidota has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green color, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals and yellow sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lepidota is primarily native to Costa Rica and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of these Central American countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within these two nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lepidota was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, clearings, and urban environments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded conditions and can quickly colonize open spaces. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
