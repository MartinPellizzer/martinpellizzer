<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum yezoense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age.
