                    <h1>Acanthocalycium spiniflorum f. violaceum</h1>
<p>Acanthocalycium spiniflorum f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'violaceum' is distinguished by its unique violet flower color, setting it apart from the typical green-flowered variety.</p>
