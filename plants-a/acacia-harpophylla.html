                        <h1>Acacia harpophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia harpophylla, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, fern-like phyllodes that are typically pale green to grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
