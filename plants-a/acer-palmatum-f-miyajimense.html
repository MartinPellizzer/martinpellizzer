<p>Acer palmatum f. miyajimense, commonly known as the Miyajima maple, is a compact, ornamental variety of Japanese maple.</p>

The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 feet, making it suitable for small gardens or containers. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for privacy screens or foundation plantings.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green during the growing season, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
