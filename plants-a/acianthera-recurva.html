                <h1>Acianthera recurva</h1>
<p>Acianthera recurva, commonly known as the recurved acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera recurva has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly wavy edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a delicate structure consisting of three petals and three sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera recurva is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Bolivia, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the temperate to subtropical regions of these South American countries. It typically grows in forested areas and grasslands with well-drained soil. The plant thrives in regions with moderate to high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera recurva was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in that region. The plant spreads rapidly through its seed production. It often outcompetes native vegetation for resources.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
