                <h1>Acianthera tunguraguae</h1>
<p>Acianthera tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera tunguraguae has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera tunguraguae is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, montane forests at higher elevations. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera tunguraguae was mainly introduced to the Neotropical region, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This orchid is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is often associated with specific mycorrhizal relationships. Its introduction has been documented in countries like Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited and largely restricted to its native habitats.</p>
