<p>Acianthera tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
