                <h1>Achyroseris albertoregelia</h1>
<p>Achyroseris albertoregelia, commonly known as the Albert Regel's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers, which mature into fluffy seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in its native habitat's ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyroseris albertoregelia has leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and grass-like in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris albertoregelia is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with strong maritime influences. This species is commonly found in dunes and scrub habitats, where it adapts to the harsh, salty conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris albertoregelia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is often found growing in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it does not currently pose a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
