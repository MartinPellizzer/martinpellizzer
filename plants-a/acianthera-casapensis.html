                <h1>Acianthera casapensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera casapensis, commonly known as the Casapense orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The flowers of Acianthera casapensis are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera casapensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size of about 5-7 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale pink to white color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera casapensis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Argentina, particularly in the provinces of Jujuy and Salta.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, dry forests, and scrublands at elevations ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters above sea level. This orchid thrives in environments with well-drained soils and receives limited rainfall throughout the year. It is often associated with the Andean foothills and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera casapensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near rivers or in humid forests. It has been noted for its ornamental value, leading to its cultivation in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
