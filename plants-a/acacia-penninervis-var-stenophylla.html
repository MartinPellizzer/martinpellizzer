<p>Acacia penninervis var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia penninervis var. stenophylla has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a pale green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops vertical fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads, with yellow to golden yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by birds. The fruit is a legume pod containing small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The root system is deep and taprooted, allowing the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
