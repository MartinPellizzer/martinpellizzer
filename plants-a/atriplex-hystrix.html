<p>Atriplex hystrix, commonly known as the spiny saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed leaves and spiny stems, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Atriplex hystrix plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
