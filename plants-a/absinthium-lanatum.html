<p>Absinthium lanatum, commonly known as woolly wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic properties are attributed to compounds such as thujone and other essential oils.</p>
<p>Absinthium lanatum is often found in dry, sunny habitats like meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
