                <h1>Adenocalymma nervosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma nervosum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for cultivation in xerophytic gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nervosum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nervosum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil, particularly in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. It thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. The plant is commonly observed in dune ecosystems and coastal woodlands.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this specific geographic area in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nervosum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
