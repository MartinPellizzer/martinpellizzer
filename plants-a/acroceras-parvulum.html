                <h1>Acroceras parvulum</h1>
<p>Acroceras parvulum, commonly known as the small yellow orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in grassy areas and rocky soils. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers with a faintly fragrant scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open habitats with moderate sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological niche.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras parvulum has small, simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in small umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras parvulum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly soils along coastal areas and in dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with limestone or calcareous substrates. It is a low-growing perennial herb that is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a regionally significant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras parvulum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. The plant's ability to spread rapidly has led to its establishment in areas outside its native range. It is often mistaken for native grasses due to its similar appearance, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
