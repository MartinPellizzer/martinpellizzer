<p>Acinodendron ferruginatum, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>
