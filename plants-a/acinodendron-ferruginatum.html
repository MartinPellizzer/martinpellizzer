                <h1>Acinodendron ferruginatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ferruginatum, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ferruginatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, have a tubular structure, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in dry, sandy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ferruginatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen in both natural and human-modified landscapes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is not widely found outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ferruginatum was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains under study.</p>
