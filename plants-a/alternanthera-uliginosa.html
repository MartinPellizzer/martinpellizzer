                    <h1>Alternanthera uliginosa</h1>
<p>Alternanthera uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp beauty or red swamp alga, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or pink inflorescences that emerge from dense clusters of small, green leaves. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
