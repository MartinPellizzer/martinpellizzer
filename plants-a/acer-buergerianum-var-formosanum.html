                <h1>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a deep green color during the growing season and turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in upright clusters. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in central and southern Taiwan. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and mountainous areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum is a decorative maple known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil, with regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in its vicinity. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and enhancing biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, enhancing ecosystem services. Culturally, it is appreciated in horticulture and landscaping for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and beauty in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum has a limited number of cultivated varieties, with popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Queen' being widely appreciated for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly hybridized due to its specific genetic makeup, some horticulturists have attempted to cross it with other maple species to enhance ornamental traits. Its unique leaf coloration and compact growth make it a valuable addition to specialty gardens and botanical collections. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it holds significant horticultural importance in the cultivation of rare and decorative maples.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation remains challenging, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
