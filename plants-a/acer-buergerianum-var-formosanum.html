<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some algae, characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns, horsetails, and other spore-producing plants, known for their primitive vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, often with showy flowers and a wide range of growth forms.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, and herbs, many of which produce fruits with a distinctive structure. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with palmately lobed leaves and often fragrant flowers.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>This variety of the maple tree is found in the mountainous regions of the island. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly seen in forested areas and along stream sides.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to specific habitats in Taiwan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum var. formosanum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington. However, it is considered a non-native species and has not been widely reported as invasive in the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to cultivated areas rather than natural ecosystems.</p>
