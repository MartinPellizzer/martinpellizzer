<p>Aquilegia vulgaris monstr.</p>
<p>degener, commonly known as the degenerate form of the common columbine, is a variant of the species characterized by its unusual and often distorted floral morphology. This plant exhibits irregularly shaped petals and a reduced number of sepals, giving it a somewhat aberrant appearance compared to the typical columbine.</p>
<p>It is believed to result from genetic mutations or environmental stressors that affect its development. While it lacks the ornamental appeal of standard cultivars, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique structural features.</p>
<p>Its occurrence is rare, making it a subject of curiosity among botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
