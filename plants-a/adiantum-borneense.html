                <h1>Adiantum borneense</h1>
<p>Adiantum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean maidenhair fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum borneense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum borneense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slender, flexible petiole. The stem is slender, creeping, and often produces aerial roots, with a smooth, pale green bark that lacks significant texture. Adiantum borneense is generally sterile and does not produce flowers, so details about flower structure, color, blooming period, or pollination method are not applicable.</p>
<p>The plant has rhizomatous roots that help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the substrate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum borneense is primarily native to Borneo, specifically in the regions of Sarawak and Brunei.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along stream banks and in shaded, moist environments. This fern thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and consistent rainfall. It is typically associated with secondary growth forests and is often seen in the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the island of Borneo, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum borneense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil, such as forest understories and rocky outcrops. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like fronds. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions.</p>
