                <h1>Actinodaphne hongkongensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne hongkongensis, commonly known as Hong Kong camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China and the Hong Kong region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark brown, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in moist, shaded habitats in mountainous areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hongkongensis has elliptical or ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are pale yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and water retention.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hongkongensis is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the regions of Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as parts of northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland evergreen forests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with limestone substrates and can be found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hongkongensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its preferred climate conditions can be found.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in areas with high humidity and warm temperatures, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its fragrant leaves. It has also been introduced to some regions of the United States, including Florida and Hawaii, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in several non-native habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive tendencies.</p>
