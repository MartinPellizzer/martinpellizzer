                <h1>Actaea spicata subsp. rubra</h1>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra, commonly known as red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, clustered, red berries that contrast with its dark green, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. Its toxic compounds, including cardenolides, make it poisonous to humans and livestock.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value is often balanced by its cautionary presence in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically 10–20 cm long, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The stem is upright, slender, and hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are white to pale pink, arranged in an erect panicle, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate composed of small follicles, which disperse via birds and mammals eating the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra is a perennial herb native to eastern North America, primarily found in the United States and Canada. Its current distribution includes parts of the northeastern and north-central regions of the United States, as well as southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters. The conservation status of Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra is currently listed as secure, though it is sometimes considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra is a striking perennial known for its vibrant red berries and delicate foliage, often cultivated in woodland gardens. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in a cold frame during late winter.</p>
<p>This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3–5 years, and thrives in partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and powdery mildew, and it pairs well with ferns and hostas in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other flora. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in wet or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra is a plant known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking red berries and attractive foliage. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its berries have been historically used in some traditional remedies.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though its use is limited due to toxicity concerns. Industrially, it has minimal economic impact, but its presence in natural habitats supports local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it serves as a symbol of resilience in certain regions and is often featured in local folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Actaea spicata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Black and Gold', which are prized for their striking foliage and dramatic red or purple flowers. It is also commonly hybridized with other Actaea species to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced traits like longer bloom periods or improved cold hardiness.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit more vibrant colors and increased disease resistance, making them popular in shaded garden settings. Horticulturally, Actaea spicata subsp. rubra is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in woodland environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of shade-loving plants in modern horticulture.</p>
