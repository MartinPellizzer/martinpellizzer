                    <h1>Amorphophallus coudercii</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus coudercii, commonly known as the giant titan arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is renowned for its massive, phallic-shaped inflorescence, which can grow up to 5 meters in height and emit a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat. The plant's unique morphology includes a large, underground tuber that stores energy for its brief flowering cycle. Its flowers consist of a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like bract, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its rare and dramatic blooming, which occurs only once every few years.</p>
