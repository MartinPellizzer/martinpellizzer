                    <h1>Aristida elliotiana</h1>
<p>Aristida elliotiana, commonly known as Elliot's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Elliot's threeawn is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
