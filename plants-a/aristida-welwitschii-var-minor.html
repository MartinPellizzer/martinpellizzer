                    <h1>Aristida welwitschii var. minor</h1>
<p>Aristida welwitschii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf porcupine grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often appear tufted at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, bristly lemma-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its drought tolerance.</p>
