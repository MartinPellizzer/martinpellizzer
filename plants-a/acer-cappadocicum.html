                <h1>Acer cappadocicum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which comprises flowering plants with diverse forms, including trees, shrubs, and climbers, often featuring compound leaves and distinctive fruits. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with showy flowers and often fleshy fruits. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maple, which includes a variety of deciduous trees and shrubs with distinctive palmate leaves and colorful autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer cappadocicum, a specific type of maple native to Turkey, known for its ornamental value and unique leaf characteristics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, yellow-green, and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that matures in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Turkey, specifically in the Cappadocia area.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations within its native range, with some populations also found in parts of northeastern Syria. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodlands and shrublands. This species is usually found at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer cappadocicum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red autumn foliage and unique umbrella-shaped crown.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, making it a long-term addition to landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its deep roots help prevent erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing soil on slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum is a species of maple native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East, known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional and medicinal properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local horticulture and can be used in landscaping and reforestation efforts. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in its native regions, often associated with resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
