                <h1>Achyronia retroflexa</h1>
<p>Achyronia retroflexa, commonly known as the purple false nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Achyronia retroflexa is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia retroflexa has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered with fine hairs, displaying a light green to reddish-brown color, and grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five petals that are pink to white in color, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia retroflexa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. This plant thrives in wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It is also present in some regions of southern North America, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to its preference for moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia retroflexa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and has been found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in these areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
