<p>Aralia cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically serrated and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure.</p>
