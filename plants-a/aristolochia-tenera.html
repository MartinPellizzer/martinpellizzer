                    <h1>Aristolochia tenera</h1>
<p>Aristolochia tenera, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a strong, spicy odor. These flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their deceptive appearance and scent.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
