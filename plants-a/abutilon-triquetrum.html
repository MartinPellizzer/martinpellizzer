<p>The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon triquetrum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 3–8 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy and somewhat woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are pendulous, with five pink or reddish petals and a yellow center, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon triquetrum is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in the Atlantic Forest region, its current distribution includes parts of Argentina and Uruguay as well. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its habitat is under pressure due to deforestation and land-use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon triquetrum is a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub known for its vibrant, showy flowers and adaptability to various climates.</p>
