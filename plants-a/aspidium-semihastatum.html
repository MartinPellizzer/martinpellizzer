<p>Aspidium semihastatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Aspidium semihastatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
