                <h1>Acer crassum</h1>
<p>Acer crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer crassum has broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a moderate growth rate. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer crassum is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once found in the wild, its current distribution is largely limited to cultivation and botanical gardens due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and declining populations, Acer crassum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer crassum is a deciduous tree known for its rapid growth and vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer crassum involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer, with foliage turning colorful in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and promote air circulation are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer crassum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex web of life. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer crassum contributes to carbon sequestration, improving air quality and supporting overall ecological health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer crassum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in folk medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood is sometimes used for small crafts and furniture due to its durability. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems, such as providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity, is an important application in environmental conservation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer crassum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental qualities, including 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids that combine traits from related maple species, enhancing its adaptability and visual appeal. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic value. They are particularly popular in regions with temperate climates where they thrive.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer crassum plays a significant role in the ornamental plant industry, contributing to garden diversity and beauty.</p>
