                <h1>Acianthera sotoana</h1>
<p>Acianthera sotoana, commonly known as the Soto's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acianthera sotoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera sotoana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a tubular structure and a sweet fragrance, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sotoana is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf and Mexico Southwest regions.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the coastal areas and lowland regions of these regions. It typically grows in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with forest understories and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sotoana was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of freshwater marshes. This plant has been reported in several states, including Texas and Louisiana, due to its adaptability to moist environments. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as ditches, roadside ditches, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
