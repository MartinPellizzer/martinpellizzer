                <h1>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, upright stems and basal leaves that are finely divided and gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>Its botanical name honors the legendary Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata is a rare, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now primarily found in isolated populations in the alpine zones of the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. This variant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specialization, it is considered endangered, with ongoing efforts to conserve its fragile alpine ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. This plant has a cold-hardy growth cycle, thriving in temperate climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its growth and repels pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, stabilizing soil in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting a healthy microclimate in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata is a perennial flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it can be incorporated into gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat skin conditions and as an antiseptic due to its essential oils. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in landscaping and floral arrangements.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. longiligulata has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated in horticulture, including 'Avalanche' and 'Silver Queen,' known for their dense, silvery foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often favored for their compact growth and ability to thrive in full sun. Hybrids involving this variety have been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and flower longevity, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. Its horticultural importance lies in its ornamental value, drought tolerance, and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It is a valuable addition to rock gardens and borders, contributing to both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
