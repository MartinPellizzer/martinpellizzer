                            <h1>Ayenia Genistella</h1>
<p>False heath, scientifically known as Ayenia genistella, is a unique flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly referred to as the heath family. This plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and dense, evergreen foliage. Despite its name, it is not closely related to true heaths or hollies. Ayenia genistella thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
