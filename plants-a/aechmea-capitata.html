                <h1>Aechmea capitata</h1>
<p>Aechmea capitata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Aechmea capitata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea capitata has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, blue-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous caudex that is often covered in a dense layer of leaf bases. Its inflorescence is a compact, spiky structure with brightly colored, tubular flowers that range from red to orange, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
