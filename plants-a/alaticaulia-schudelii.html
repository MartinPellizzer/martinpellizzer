                    <h1>Alaticaulia schudelii</h1>
<p>Alaticaulia schudelii, commonly known as the Schudel's alate caudex plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and it has a distinctive, swollen base that resembles a caudex.</p>
<p>Alaticaulia schudelii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
