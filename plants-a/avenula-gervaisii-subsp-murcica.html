<p>Avenula gervaisii subsp.</p>
<p>murcica, commonly known as the Murcian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
