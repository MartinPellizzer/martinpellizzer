<p>Acicarpha crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and broad, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acicarpha crassifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel and fodder in local communities.</p>
