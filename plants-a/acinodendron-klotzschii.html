                <h1>Acinodendron klotzschii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron klotzschii, commonly known as the African milkwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties and use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron klotzschii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron klotzschii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, lowland forests and sometimes in secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in dense tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron klotzschii was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. This plant has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as land clearing and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native flora and ecosystems.</p>
