<p>Acalypha intermedia, commonly known as the red-veined strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with distinctive red veins. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the climate. Its leaves are often palmately lobed, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or yellow.</p>
<p>Acalypha intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha intermedia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha intermedia is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands, often introduced as an ornamental or for erosion control. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically growing in moist, shaded areas near streams or in forest understories. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha intermedia is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its distribution has been influenced by human activity and habitat alteration.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha intermedia is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
