<p>Allium narcissiflorum, commonly known as the narcissus garlic or white garlic, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a strong garlic odor when the bulbs are crushed, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, while the flowers bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Allium narcissiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses.</p>
