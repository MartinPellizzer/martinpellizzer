                    <h1>Amphithalea ericifolia</h1>
<p>Amphithalea ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Amphithalea ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
