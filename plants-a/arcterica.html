                    <h1>Arcterica</h1>
<p>Arcterica, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has small, deciduous leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of hair, which helps insulate the plant against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Arcterica plays an important role in the ecosystems of its habitat, providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species.</p>
