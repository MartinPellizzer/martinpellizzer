                        <h1>Acer dasycarpum f. nanum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a compact variant of the species native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of only 1 to 2 meters. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, with a peeling texture that adds to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. nanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. The plant is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and is adapted to the rugged terrain of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized in its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. nanum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in urban landscapes and parks due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It is particularly favored for its unique, compact growth habit and striking autumn foliage. The plant's introduction has been driven by its use in landscaping and as a decorative element in gardens.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited to areas where it can establish itself without significant competition from native species.</p>
