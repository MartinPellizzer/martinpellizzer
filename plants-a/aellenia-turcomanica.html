<p>Aellenia turcomanica, commonly known as the Turcoman thornapple, is a species of flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Aellenia turcomanica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its dispersal in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia turcomanica has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a somewhat woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule containing small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>
