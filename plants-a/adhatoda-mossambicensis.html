                <h1>Adhatoda mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis, commonly known as the African skullcap, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with a tubular structure and a color ranging from pale blue to white, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis is a flowering plant native to the eastern region of South Africa, particularly in the KwaZulu-Natal province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical Africa, such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique, where it thrives in humid environments. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas like forest understories and along riverbanks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda mossambicensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis is a hardy, flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the plant’s genetic traits. The growth cycle of this plant is typically seasonal, with active growth during the warmer months and dormancy in cooler periods.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushy growth are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases like fungal infections can occur if humidity is too high.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve the plant’s overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the area.</p>
