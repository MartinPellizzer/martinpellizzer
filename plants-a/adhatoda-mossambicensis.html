                <h1>Adhatoda mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis, commonly known as the African arrowroot or kambaba, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green color and have a smooth, slightly glossy surface. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a pale blue or violet color, and bloom during the rainy season; they are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments like forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with moist soils in its native habitat. It is also occasionally found in parts of India and Sri Lanka, though it is more widespread in Africa.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mossambicensis was mainly introduced to areas where its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often along roadsides and in degraded habitats. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its competitive nature, which can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
