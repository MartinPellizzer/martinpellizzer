<p>Artemisia neglecta, commonly known as western mugwort, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, often camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Artemisia neglecta has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and is also valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
