                    <h1>Atraphaxis dumosa</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis dumosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis dumosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
