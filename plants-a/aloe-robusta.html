<p>Aloe robusta, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Aloe robusta is also valued for its medicinal properties, with gel from its leaves used in traditional remedies.</p>
