                <h1>Adhatoda maculata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda maculata, commonly known as the spotted adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a distinctive spotted pattern. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth texture, dark green upper surface, and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish in color. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with a pale blue to violet color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid environments. This plant thrives in wetlands, riverbanks, and swampy areas where it can access ample water. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is often used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as riverbanks and roadsides. The plant is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental dispersal via human activity.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
