                <h1>Adhatoda maculata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda maculata, commonly known as the spotted adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, pale blue or violet flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its use in traditional medicine and its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops a rough texture as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale blue petals, and they bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shady areas such as forest understories. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations may be threatened by habitat loss in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is a fast-growing, tropical shrub known for its ornamental leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or neem trees can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda maculata is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, aiding in the reproduction of both itself and other plants in the area. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Overall, Adhatoda maculata plays a crucial ecological role in supporting local ecosystems and promoting environmental balance.</p>
