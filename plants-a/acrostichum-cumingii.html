                <h1>Acrostichum cumingii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other hibiscus species and cotton plants. The plant features large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, swollen calyx. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and leathery in texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruits are dry, three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical regions in Asia, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically near water bodies such as rivers and swamps. This plant is commonly found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acrostichum cumingii is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia, known for its lush, feathery fronds and adaptability to humid environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizomes, with spore propagation taking several months to produce mature plants. The growth cycle of Acrostichum cumingii is slow, with new fronds unfurling gradually throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, moist soil and requires regular watering to maintain humidity without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning of old fronds promotes healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like begonias or orchids can enhance its ornamental value in a tropical garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii is a tropical fern that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its spore-bearing structures and dense foliage. The plant acts as a natural erosion control measure due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. It also serves as a companion plant in wetland ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its presence enhances the overall health of the environment by contributing to nutrient cycling and habitat creation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cumingii is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it plays a role in traditional medicine in some cultures, where its leaves may be used for their purported healing properties. The plant contributes to biodiversity and serves as a habitat for various insects and small animals, supporting local ecosystems. In terms of economic value, it is primarily cultivated for horticultural purposes, adding aesthetic value to gardens and landscapes.</p>
