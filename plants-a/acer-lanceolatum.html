                <h1>Acer lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Acer lanceolatum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum has elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in width, displaying a vibrant green on top and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that disperse by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum is a species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and parts of Hubei and Fujian.</p>
<p>While it was historically restricted to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. This species is typically found at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, which may impact its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during its establishment phase, though it is drought-tolerant once mature. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and produces edible fruits that feed birds and squirrels. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability.
