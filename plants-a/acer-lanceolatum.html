                <h1>Acer lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Acer lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum has compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the tree firmly in the soil, helping to absorb water and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer lanceolatum is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer lanceolatum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lanceolatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers and abundant nectar. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of organisms. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and offering habitat for diverse flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
