                    <h1>Agrostis alba var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Agrostis alba var. laevigata, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft-textured leaves that give it a silky appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats or clumps and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats.</p>
<p>Its inflorescence consists of slender spikelets that are often concealed among the foliage, making it less showy than other grasses.</p>
