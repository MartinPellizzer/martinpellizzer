<p>Asperula subvelutina, commonly known as the velvet asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and seasonal color changes.</p>
