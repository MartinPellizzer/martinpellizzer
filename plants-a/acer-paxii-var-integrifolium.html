                <h1>Acer paxii var. integrifolium</h1>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium has palmately compound leaves that are typically lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually medium-sized, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and exhibit a vibrant green color during the growing season. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in moist, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Currently, it is found primarily in isolated populations within its original habitat, though its distribution has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in temperate forests at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant follows a typical temperate growth cycle, shedding its leaves in autumn and entering a dormant phase in winter before new growth emerges in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, loamy soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and remove diseased or damaged branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold to deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium is a shade-tolerant tree that provides habitat and food for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense canopy helps prevent soil erosion by stabilizing the ground with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by enhancing nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support wildlife, though it lacks significant economic value in commercial markets. Culturally, it holds symbolic importance in certain regions where it is appreciated for its aesthetic value and ecological role.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely ecological and symbolic rather than widely commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer paxii var. integrifolium has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Sunset' being among the most popular for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is occasionally used in hybridization efforts to introduce unique leaf patterns and improved hardiness into other maple species. While not as widely cultivated as other maples, it holds horticultural importance for its ornamental value and potential in breeding programs. Its hybrids often exhibit enhanced adaptability to different climates and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is primarily of interest to specialized gardeners and plant breeders.</p>
