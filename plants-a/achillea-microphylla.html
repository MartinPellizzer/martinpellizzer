                <h1>Achillea microphylla</h1>
<p>Achillea microphylla, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Achillea microphylla is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea microphylla has compound, basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark, and grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea microphylla is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to some areas of the United States, including California and Oregon, where it is often cultivated or has become naturalized. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows, coastal cliffs, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its populations can be vulnerable to habitat loss and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea microphylla is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and compact growth, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal watering once established, though regular watering is needed during dry spells.</p>
<p>Light fertilization in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering encourages bushier growth and prevents legginess. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum enhances its ornamental appeal and improves soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
