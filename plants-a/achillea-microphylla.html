                <h1>Achillea microphylla</h1>
<p>Achillea microphylla, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Achillea microphylla is valued for its medicinal properties and ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea microphylla has small, gray-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-brown color, growing in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are flat-topped clusters (cymes) of small, pale yellow to white florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea microphylla is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other areas, such as North America and Australia, where it is now found in various regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its invasive potential in non-native regions raises concerns for local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea microphylla is a hardy perennial known for its compact growth and vibrant, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, becoming active in spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering maintains its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender or yarrow in companion planting.</p>
