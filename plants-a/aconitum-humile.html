                <h1>Aconitum humile</h1>
<p>Aconitum humile, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum humile has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a greyish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense racemes, with spurred petals and showy sepals, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, deep and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum humile is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Alps, Carpathians, and Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forested slopes and meadows at high altitudes. This plant is commonly found in countries like Austria, Germany, Italy, and the Czech Republic. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often restricted to isolated populations in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum humile was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the 19th century by botanists and horticulturists who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since spread beyond cultivated gardens and is now considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>However, it poses a threat to native plant communities due to its competitive nature.</p>
