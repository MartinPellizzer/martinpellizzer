                <h1>Acrosorus symmetricus</h1>
<p>Acrosorus symmetricus, commonly known as the symmetric fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are symmetrically arranged. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique reproductive system involving spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a trait that aids in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosorus symmetricus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally just beneath the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus symmetricus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. This plant thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is a characteristic component of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus symmetricus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf structure and aesthetic appeal. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become a problematic invasive species in wetland habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its spread and restoring native plant communities.</p>
