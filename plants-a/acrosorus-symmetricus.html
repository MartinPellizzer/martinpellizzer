                    <h1>Acrosorus symmetricus</h1>
<p>Acrosorus symmetricus, commonly known as the symmetric fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are symmetrically arranged. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique reproductive system involving spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a trait that aids in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
