<p>Acrostichum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soils, while its fronds can reach lengths of up to several meters.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
