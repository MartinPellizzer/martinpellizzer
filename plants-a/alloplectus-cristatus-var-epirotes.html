                    <h1>Alloplectus cristatus var. epirotes</h1>
<p>Alloplectus cristatus var. epirotes, commonly known as the Epirotic starwort, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of northern Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence, which consists of small, clustered flowers arranged in a radiating pattern. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a soft, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
