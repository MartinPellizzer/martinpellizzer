                    <h1>Aspidium zeylanicum</h1>
<p>Aspidium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice paddies. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
