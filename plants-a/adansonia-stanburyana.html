                    <h1>Adansonia stanburyana</h1>
<p>Adansonia stanburyana, commonly known as the Stanbury's baobab, is a unique species of the Adansonia genus native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, a feature typical of baobab trees adapted to arid environments. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fibrous capsule that contains seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptations to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
