<p>Amauropelta odontosora, commonly known as the toothed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
