<p>Arthrocnemum pillansii var. dunense, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling survival in extreme drought conditions. The plant typically grows in coastal and inland sandy soils, thriving in regions with high salinity. Its small, greenish-gray flowers appear in clusters, often blooming during brief periods of rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a crucial role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
