                    <h1>Arenaria berteroana</h1>
<p>Arenaria berteroana, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, allowing it to store water and survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria berteroana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
