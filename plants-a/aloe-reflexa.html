                    <h1>Aloe reflexa</h1>
<p>Aloe reflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, spindly stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The leaves are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
