                <h1>Acrilia sloanei</h1>
<p>Acrilia sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's acrilia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its leaves are ovate with a velvety texture, and it produces small, hairy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrilia sloanei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrilia sloanei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat shrub-like habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrilia sloanei is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific island ecosystems, reflecting its adaptation to these unique habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrilia sloanei was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and roadsides. The plant is known for its compact growth habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It has been reported in several protected natural areas, raising concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid spread, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
