<p>Aechmea lugoi, commonly known as the Guatemalan pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often followed by small, clustered berries.</p>
<p>Aechmea lugoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat.</p>
