<p>Artemisia leucodes, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia leucodes is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
