                    <h1>Ambelania tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Ambelania tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered ambelania, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on filtered sunlight. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ambelania tenuiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
