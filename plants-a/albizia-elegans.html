<p>Albizia elegans, commonly known as the silky senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features pinnate leaves with silky, pale-green undersides that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Albizia elegans is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
