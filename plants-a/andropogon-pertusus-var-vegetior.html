                    <h1>Andropogon pertusus var. vegetior</h1>
<p>Andropogon pertusus var. vegetior, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its slender stems and its ability to thrive in wet or poorly drained soils.</p>
