                <h1>Acriulus titan</h1>
<p>Acriulus titan, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, showy flowers that can reach up to two feet in diameter. The plant has a robust, woody stem with broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters and come in shades of white, yellow, and orange.</p>
<p>Acriulus titan is known for its strong fragrance, which attracts a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriulus titan has large, broad leaves that are oval in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 30 to 50 centimeters in length, with a deep green color that turns bronze in the fall.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is a dark greyish-brown, and it grows in a sprawling, bushy pattern. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with five petals, in shades of violet and white, blooming in late spring and early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. The fruit is a large, spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive and taprooted, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriulus titan is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall and dense vegetation. This plant is commonly found in lowland areas near rivers and streams, where the soil is rich and well-drained. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has become increasingly fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriulus titan was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with abundant sunlight and consistent moisture, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with warm climates. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it has become a popular ornamental species. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in invaded ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is necessary to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
