                    <h1>Axiniphyllum</h1>
<p>Axiniphyllum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, and it relies on water for pollination. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Axiniphyllum plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
