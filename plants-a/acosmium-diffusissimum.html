                <h1>Acosmium diffusissimum</h1>
<p>Acosmium diffusissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium diffusissimum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium diffusissimum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in local horticulture.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium diffusissimum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil. The plant spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded in recent decades, raising concerns among ecologists and land managers.</p>
