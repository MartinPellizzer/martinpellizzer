                <h1>Aconitum bulbilliferum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bulbilliferum, commonly known as the bulblet aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its stem, which are small, vegetative propagules that can develop into new plants. These bulbils are an important feature for its propagation and survival in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aconitum bulbilliferum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially hazardous plant to handle.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulbilliferum has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are typically dark green in color and can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in tall, spire-like clusters, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. The plant produces follicle fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are tuberous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and store nutrients for future growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulbilliferum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments like forests and mountainous areas. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific habitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulbilliferum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with indigenous flora and can alter soil chemistry, affecting ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
