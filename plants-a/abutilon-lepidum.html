                <h1>Abutilon lepidum</h1>
<p>Abutilon lepidum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a herbaceous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon lepidum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy, silver-green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and often reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is either erect or spreading. The flowers are showy, with five petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon lepidum is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations along the Pacific coast. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in dunes or coastal scrub environments. This species is typically found at low altitudes, generally below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Abutilon lepidum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
