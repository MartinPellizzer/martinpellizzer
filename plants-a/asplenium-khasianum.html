                    <h1>Asplenium khasianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium khasianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
