<p>Acacia alliacea, commonly known as the garlic acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods containing seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia alliacea is also notable for its strong, garlic-like scent, which is released when the leaves are damaged.</p>
