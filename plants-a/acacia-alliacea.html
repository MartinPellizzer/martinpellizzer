                <h1>Acacia alliacea</h1>
<p>Acacia alliacea, commonly known as the garlic acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring a woody stem and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Its leaves and bark contain sulfur compounds that give off a garlic-like odor when crushed.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia alliacea has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, thread-like leaflets arranged in feathery clusters, giving it a delicate appearance; the leaves are typically green, though they may turn reddish in response to drought.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are yellow and form in dense, globular clusters, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers and stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia alliacea is a shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and parts of the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along coastal regions. Acacia alliacea typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia alliacea is a hardy shrub native to the Mediterranean region, known for its fragrant foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia alliacea is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting other plant growth. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and sustainability.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia alliacea is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
