                <h1>Aconitum sturiense</h1>
<p>Aconitum sturiense, commonly known as the Sturiense monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum sturiense is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sturiense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are large, broadly ovate, and often deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, typically greenish-brown in color, with a straight growth pattern and no significant branching. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with five petals and a spurs-like structure, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>
