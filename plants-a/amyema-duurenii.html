                    <h1>Amyema duurenii</h1>
<p>Amyema duurenii, commonly known as the Duuren's lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture that distinguishes it from other lichen species. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, thriving in rocky habitats across southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Amyema duurenii is considered a rare and specialized lichen with limited distribution.</p>
