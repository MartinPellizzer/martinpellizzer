                <h1>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule</h1>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule has large, compound leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and usually purple-tinged, with a fibrous, rough bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are showy, blue to purple spires with many small, spurred flowers, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family, native to the high mountain regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This variant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat destruction and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare plant in its natural and cultivated environments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule is a striking perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, with new shoots emerging in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>Regular watering is essential, especially during dry spells, while fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes robust growth. Pruning spent flower stalks after blooming helps maintain shape, and the plant is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its ornamental value in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule is a striking plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the biodiversity of the surrounding ecosystem. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of its habitat by supporting a diverse range of species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule is a striking ornamental plant primarily cultivated for its showy, colorful flowers, making it a popular choice in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its beauty contributes to horticultural and landscape design. Historically, some members of the Aconitum genus have been used in traditional medicine, though A. koelleanum var. crassicaule itself is not widely known for medicinal properties. It holds cultural significance in certain regions where it is admired for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is not suitable for industrial or economic applications and should be handled with caution.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
