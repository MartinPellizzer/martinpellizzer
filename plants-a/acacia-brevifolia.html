                    <h1>Acacia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a small shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, rounded phyllodes that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal regions and heathlands.</p>
<p>Acacia brevifolia is well adapted to dry conditions and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
