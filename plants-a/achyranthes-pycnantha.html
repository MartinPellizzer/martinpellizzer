                <h1>Achyranthes pycnantha</h1>
<p>Achyranthes pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant features alternate, narrow, and sometimes hairy leaves, and its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and waste areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pycnantha has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are generally green in color and range from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pycnantha is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including regions such as India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest undergrowth and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Its distribution spans across several countries in the Indian subcontinent and the Far East.</p>
<p>It is also known to occur in parts of Australia, though its presence there is less common.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pycnantha was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, China, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through its rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely associated with human activity, including agriculture and landscaping.</p>
