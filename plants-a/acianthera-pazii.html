                <h1>Acianthera pazii</h1>
<p>Acianthera pazii, commonly known as the Pazze's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, while the flowers are often pink or white with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Acianthera pazii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pazii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellowish throat, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pazii is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland areas. This orchid species thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests and secondary growth habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in the western and central parts of Colombia.</p>
<p>Acianthera pazii is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pazii was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as part of horticultural and ornamental plant introductions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and wetlands. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora and fauna is still being monitored by environmental agencies.</p>
