                <h1>Aegilops markgrafii</h1>
<p>Aegilops markgrafii, commonly known as the Markgraf's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops markgrafii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops markgrafii has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is mostly bushy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white structures arranged in loose panicles, blooming in early summer and relying on wind for pollination. The plant produces spikelets as its fruit, containing small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>
