<p>Actiniopteris semiflabellata, commonly known as the semi-flabellate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a fan shape. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Actiniopteris semiflabellata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
