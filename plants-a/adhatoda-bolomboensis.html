                <h1>Adhatoda bolomboensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis, commonly known as the Madagascar horse chestnut, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces fruit capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, bark that is reddish-brown in color and develops longitudinal ridges as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, with a pinkish-white color that blooms during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar, where it is found primarily in the northeastern part of the island.</p>
<p>Currently, its distribution is restricted to specific areas within Madagascar, particularly in the Anosy region. It thrives in moist, humid environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, Adhatoda bolomboensis is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population status remaining poorly understood.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with organic pesticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproductive process and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the area by offering habitat and resources to a variety of organisms.</p>
