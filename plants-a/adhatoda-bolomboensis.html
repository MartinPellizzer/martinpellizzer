<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis, commonly known as the African arrowroot or African sarsaparilla, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bolomboensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
