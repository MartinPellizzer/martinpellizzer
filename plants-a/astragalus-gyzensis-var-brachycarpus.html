                    <h1>Astragalus gyzensis var. brachycarpus</h1>
<p>Astragalus gyzensis var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-carpelled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact pods compared to other Astragalus species.</p>
