                    <h1>Abarema</h1>
<p>Abarema, commonly known as the "false acacia," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Abarema species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps improve soil fertility.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and blooms.</p>
