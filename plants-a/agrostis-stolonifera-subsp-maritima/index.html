                            <h1>Agrostis Stolonifera Subsp. Maritima</h1>
<p>Sea bentgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis stolonifera subsp. maritima, is a resilient coastal plant that thrives in harsh marine environments. It is commonly found along shorelines, dunes, and salt marshes where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This grass species is characterized by its low-growing, creeping growth habit and its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its adaptability makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Despite its hardy nature, it remains a subject of ecological study due to its unique survival strategies.</p>
