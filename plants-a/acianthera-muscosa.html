<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble moss due to their dense, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
