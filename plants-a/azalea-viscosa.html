                    <h1>Azalea viscosa</h1>
<p>Azalea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky azalea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rhododendron genus within the Ericaceae family, which includes many other ornamental shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Azalea viscosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its sticky resinous sap, which gives it its common name, can be a distinguishing feature when identifying the plant in the wild.</p>
