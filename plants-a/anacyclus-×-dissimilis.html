                    <h1>Anacyclus × dissimilis</h1>
<p>Anacyclus × dissimilis, commonly known as the hybrid desert dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions.</p>
<p>Anacyclus × dissimilis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in desert landscapes.</p>
