                            <h1>Asplenium Platyneuron Var. Serratum</h1>
<p>Serrated spleenwort, scientifically known as Asplenium platyneuron var. serratum, is a unique and resilient fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety of spleenwort is distinguished by its sharply serrated leaf margins, which give it its common name and make it visually striking. Found in temperate regions across the globe, it often grows on rock faces or in crevices where other plants struggle to take root. Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly adaptable and can survive in a range of environmental conditions. Its presence in both natural and cultivated settings highlights its ecological and ornamental value.</p>
