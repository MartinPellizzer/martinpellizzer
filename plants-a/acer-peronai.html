                <h1>Acer peronai</h1>
<p>Acer peronai, commonly known as the Peron's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet and prefers well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer peronai has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a single trunk with a rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer peronai is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in a few protected areas within its native habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer peronai is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve this unique and rare plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer peronai is a small, ornamental maple tree known for its delicate foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer peronai is relatively slow, with steady growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion plants like lavender or marigolds.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer peronai is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and produces edible fruits that are consumed by animals. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a variety of life forms. Its roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in areas prone to degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer peronai contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and providing habitat for numerous organisms.</p>
