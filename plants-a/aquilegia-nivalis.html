<p>Aquilegia nivalis, commonly known as the snow bell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold climates and high altitudes. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or mountainous soils.</p>
<p>Aquilegia nivalis is often found in meadows and open slopes where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
