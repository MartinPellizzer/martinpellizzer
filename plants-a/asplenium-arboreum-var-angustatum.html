<p>Asplenium arboreum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, almost lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
