                <h1>Acrostichum brachyneuron</h1>
<p>Acrostichum brachyneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brachyneuron has long, narrow leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 30 to 60 centimeters in length, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture, and it grows in a spreading pattern, often forming dense clumps. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-angled capsule that releases small, winged seeds through dry dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brachyneuron is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is well adapted to the wet conditions of its native habitat. It is typically found in swampy areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southeastern Asian archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum brachyneuron was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and adaptability to humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it can form dense stands. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is valued for its lush foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
