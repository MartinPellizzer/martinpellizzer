                    <h1>Apatostelis tonduziana</h1>
<p>Apatostelis tonduziana, commonly known as the Tonduz's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth and sometimes slightly granular surface. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique chemical composition and ecological role in soil formation.</p>
