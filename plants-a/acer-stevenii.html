                    <h1>Acer stevenii</h1>
<p>Acer stevenii, commonly known as Steven's maple, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
