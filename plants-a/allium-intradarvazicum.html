<p>Allium intradarvazicum, commonly known as the Armenian leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, cylindrical stem that bears small, white, star-shaped flowers arranged in a loose umbel. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
