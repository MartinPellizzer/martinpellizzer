                    <h1>Achillea moschata var. stenorhachis</h1>
<p>Achillea moschata var. stenorhachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical A. moschata. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees.</p>
