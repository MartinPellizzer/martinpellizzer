<p>Agalma glaucum, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Agalma glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
