<p>Asplenium subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a dark green color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium subsessile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
