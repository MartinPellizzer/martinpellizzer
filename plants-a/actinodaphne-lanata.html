                <h1>Actinodaphne lanata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata, commonly known as the woolly actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a moderate size and smooth margins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a mild scent when scratched. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release dark, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is often found growing in the understory, where it benefits from the shade provided by taller trees.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some invasive plant lists due to its rapid growth and ability to spread in new environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
