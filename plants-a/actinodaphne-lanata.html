                <h1>Actinodaphne lanata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata, commonly known as the hairy laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata has compound, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Indo-Malayan region, though it is now considered rare and localized. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas, often near streams or in shaded understory environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Actinodaphne lanata is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired characteristics. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanata is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, which play a crucial role in its reproduction. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats for smaller organisms. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinodaphne lanata contributes significantly to ecological balance by offering multiple benefits to both the local flora and fauna.</p>
