                <h1>Actinospermum uniflorum</h1>
<p>Actinospermum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower star-pear, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble stars. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals that are fused at the base.</p>
<p>Actinospermum uniflorum is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinospermum uniflorum has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces solitary, showy flowers with five pink to red petals, blooming in spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospermum uniflorum is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky outcrops, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with heathlands and coastal scrub. It is known for its attractive, showy flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospermum uniflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become established in various regions across the country. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is now classified as a potential environmental weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
