<p>Achillea grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of gray-green, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>grandifolia has compound, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>grandifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. While its native range is primarily in these areas, it is now also found in parts of northern Africa and the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,800 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that its population is stable and not under immediate threat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>grandifolia is a hardy perennial known for its showy, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late fall. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
