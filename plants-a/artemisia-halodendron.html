                    <h1>Artemisia halodendron</h1>
<p>Artemisia halodendron, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia halodendron is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
