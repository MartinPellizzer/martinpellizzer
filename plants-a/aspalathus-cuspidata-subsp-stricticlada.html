<p>Aspalathus cuspidata subsp.</p>
<p>stricticlada, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rooibos, is a South African plant native to the Western Cape region. It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a key adaptation to its natural habitat. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos, but differs in its leaf structure and growth habits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and ecological importance in local ecosystems.</p>
