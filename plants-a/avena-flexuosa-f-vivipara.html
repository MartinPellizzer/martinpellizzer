                    <h1>Avena flexuosa f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Avena flexuosa f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its unique reproductive feature.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits vivipary, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces a loose panicle of spikelets.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying vivipary and its adaptation to wetland habitats.</p>
