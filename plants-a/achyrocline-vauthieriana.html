                <h1>Achyrocline vauthieriana</h1>
<p>Achyrocline vauthieriana, commonly known as the Vauthier's achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its flowers are usually small and yellowish, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline vauthieriana has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and slightly woody, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline vauthieriana is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the forest understory. The species is commonly associated with humid lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline vauthieriana was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. The plant has since become established in certain areas of the island. It is considered a non-native species in the Hawaiian ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
