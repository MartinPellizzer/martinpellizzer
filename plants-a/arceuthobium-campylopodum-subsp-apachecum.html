<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>apachecum, commonly known as the Apache witchweed, is a parasitic plant that exclusively relies on host plants for its survival. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, making it entirely dependent on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche.</p>
