                    <h1>Aporostylis</h1>
<p>Aporostylis, commonly known as the spike-rush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, often in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Aporostylis species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, grassy leaves and small, clustered flowers. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 50 species, many of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
