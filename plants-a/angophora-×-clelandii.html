                    <h1>Angophora × clelandii</h1>
<p>Angophora × clelandii, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Angophora costata and Angophora robusta.</p>
<p>It is a medium to tall tree characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, often revealing a reddish hue. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and riverine habitats across eastern Australia.</p>
<p>Angophora × clelandii is valued for its ecological role and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental bark and adaptability.</p>
