                <h1>Aconogonon coriarium</h1>
<p>Aconogonon coriarium, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconogonon coriarium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon coriarium has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are generally dark green and measure about 5-8 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and stamen, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon coriarium is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with a temperate climate. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Namibia and Botswana as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon coriarium was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to form dense stands and produce large quantities of viable seeds.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
