                    <h1>Alliaria brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Alliaria brachycarpa, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several tiny, black seeds. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from the sulfur compounds in its leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in North America, it is often considered a noxious weed.</p>
