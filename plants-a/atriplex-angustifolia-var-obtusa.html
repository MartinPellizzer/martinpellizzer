<p>Atriplex angustifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, salt-secreting hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, oval-shaped seed pods. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
