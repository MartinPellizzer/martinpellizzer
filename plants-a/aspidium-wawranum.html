<p>Aspidium wawranum, commonly known as the Wawran water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Aspidium wawranum plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms.</p>
