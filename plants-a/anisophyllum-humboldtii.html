                    <h1>Anisophyllum humboldtii</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
