<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a thin, smooth cuticle, distinguishing it from other aloe varieties. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
