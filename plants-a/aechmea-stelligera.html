                <h1>Aechmea stelligera</h1>
<p>Aechmea stelligera, commonly known as the star pineapple, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, spathaceous bracts that enclose the inflorescence, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, strap-like, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aechmea stelligera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea stelligera has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, leathery, and arranged in a compact circle, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base that supports the rosette, and its surface is smooth with a dark green color. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of pink or red, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that produces small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in the soil, often growing in rocky or bromeliad-like environments.</p>
