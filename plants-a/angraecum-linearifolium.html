                    <h1>Angraecum linearifolium</h1>
<p>Angraecum linearifolium, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and intricate, spider-like flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are attracted to the nectar-rich spurs.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
