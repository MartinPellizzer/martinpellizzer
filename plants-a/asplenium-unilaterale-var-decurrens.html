                    <h1>Asplenium unilaterale var. decurrens</h1>
<p>Asplenium unilaterale var. decurrens, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that often have a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in crevices of rocks or on the trunks of trees, forming dense, carpet-like mats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
