<p>Abies excelsa var. finedonensis, commonly known as the Finedon Fir, is a rare subspecies of the silver fir native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and remain attached to the branches for an extended period. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
