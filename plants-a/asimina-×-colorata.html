                    <h1>Asimina × colorata</h1>
<p>Asimina × colorata, commonly known as the yellow haw, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Asimina triloba (the common pawpaw) and Asimina calocarpa.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and South Carolina. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, yellow, fleshy drupe that ripens in the fall and is edible, though not as widely consumed as the pawpaw.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
