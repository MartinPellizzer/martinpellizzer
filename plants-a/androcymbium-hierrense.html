                    <h1>Androcymbium hierrense</h1>
<p>Androcymbium hierrense, commonly known as the Hirtzberg orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, spurred lip that serves as a nectar reservoir. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Androcymbium hierrense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
