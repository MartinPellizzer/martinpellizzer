                <h1>Achillea sintenisii</h1>
<p>Achillea sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sintenisii has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and have a grayish-green color with a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base upwards. The flowers are compound, consisting of small yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sintenisii is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in dry grasslands. Its distribution is limited to certain habitats within Turkey, where it adapts to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species, highlighting its unique ecological significance in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sintenisii was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe and North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>It was primarily introduced during the 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturists and botanical enthusiasts seeking to cultivate new plant species for gardens. Despite its beauty, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has led to concerns about its ecological impact, prompting efforts to monitor and control its spread.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is now limited to regions where it has been intentionally planted or has naturalized.</p>
