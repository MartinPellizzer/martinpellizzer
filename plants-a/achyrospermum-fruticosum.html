                <h1>Achyrospermum fruticosum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, woody texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a sprawling or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, oblong seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in open, sunny environments such as savannas and disturbed soils near human settlements. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyrospermum fruticosum is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum is a flowering plant known for its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of this plant typically includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are beneficial, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
