                <h1>Achyrospermum fruticosum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum, commonly known as the Brazilian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure.</p>
<p>It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant flowers and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the diverse ecosystems of this island nation, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in open woodlands and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range, it is not found naturally elsewhere in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum fruticosum was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with disturbed soils, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats contribute to its success in these habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
