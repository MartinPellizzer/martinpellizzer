                    <h1>Ambrosia trifida var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Ambrosia trifida var. integrifolia, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with smooth, entire margins and a tall, branched stem that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reputation as an allergenic weed. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive in full sun.</p>
