                    <h1>Artemisia campestris var. sericea</h1>
<p>Artemisia campestris var. sericea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact, spherical clusters called heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal uses.</p>
