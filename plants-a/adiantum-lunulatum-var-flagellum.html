                    <h1>Adiantum lunulatum var. flagellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lunulatum var. flagellum, commonly known as the flagellum maidenhair fern, is a striking fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often trail from the plant, giving it a flowing, almost ethereal appearance. The fronds are typically bright green, with a slightly waxy texture, and they produce small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
