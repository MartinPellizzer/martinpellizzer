                <h1>Acer negundo f. fructu-rubro</h1>
<p>Acer negundo f. fructu-rubro, commonly known as the red-fruited silver maple, is a botanical variant of the silver maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-brown fruits, which set it apart from the typical green fruits of the standard species. The plant exhibits the typical characteristics of the Acer negundo species, including opposite leaf arrangement and a symmetrical, spreading crown. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its unique fruit color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. fructu-rubro has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are ovate to ovate-oblong in shape, with 5-9 leaflets, each measuring 3-7 cm in length, and a bright green color during the growing season, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins, appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. fructu-rubro is a rare and unique variant of the box elder tree, native to specific regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now primarily found in the United States, particularly in areas of Pennsylvania and New York. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species and is listed as endangered in some regions, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. fructu-rubro is a unique cultivar of the boxelder tree known for its striking red fruit clusters.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This fast-growing tree thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, needing regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain shape and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. fructu-rubro is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forested areas, enhancing the growth of neighboring vegetation. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
