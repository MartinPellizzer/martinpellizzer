                <h1>Adicea mexicana</h1>
<p>Adicea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Adicea mexicana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea mexicana has leaves that are simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea mexicana is primarily native to Central America, particularly Mexico and parts of northern Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dry to semi-arid environments. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. It is also present in some areas of the Caribbean, including the Yucat√°n Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with limestone soils and coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea mexicana was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly in regions where its ornamental value is appreciated.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in disturbed soils and along roadsides, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its successful establishment. It is commonly found in the southern United States and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, monitoring its spread is essential to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
