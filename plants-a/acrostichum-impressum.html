                <h1>Acrostichum impressum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum impressum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically accompanied by prominent stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Acrostichum impressum is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking foliage and seasonal blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum impressum has broad, lanceolate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy with a rough, dark brown bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in spreading the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum impressum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. Its distribution extends from southern Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
