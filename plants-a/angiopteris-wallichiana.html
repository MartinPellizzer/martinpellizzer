<p>Angiopteris wallichiana, commonly known as the Wallich's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and produces roots for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris wallichiana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
