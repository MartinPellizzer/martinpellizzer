                    <h1>Allosorus microphyllus var. elongata</h1>
<p>Allosorus microphyllus var. elongata, commonly known as the slender-leaved allosorus, is a rare and diminutive fern species characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features small, delicate leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
