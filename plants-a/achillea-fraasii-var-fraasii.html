                <h1>Achillea fraasii var. fraasii</h1>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. fraasii, commonly known as the fraasii yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. fraasii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense coating of hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing from the base to form a compact shrub. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. fraasii is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and Romania, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, rocky soils in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fraasii var. fraasii is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune back spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
