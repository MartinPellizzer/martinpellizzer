                    <h1>Anisocampium sheareri</h1>
<p>Anisocampium sheareri, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered with fine hairs. Anisocampium sheareri typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most species of Urtica.</p>
