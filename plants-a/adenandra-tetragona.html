                <h1>Adenandra tetragona</h1>
<p>Adenandra tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled adenandra, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems with four distinct angular ridges, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the winter months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's climbing habit and providing stability in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with humid climates and is adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a challenge for land managers in controlling its spread.</p>
