                <h1>Adenandra tetragona</h1>
<p>Adenandra tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled adenandra, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of South Africa, specifically found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to fragmented habitats due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coastal forests and mountainous regions. Adenandra tetragona typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is listed as vulnerable due to its limited range and threats from habitat destruction and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa, known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Adenandra tetragona is slow to moderate, with new growth occurring primarily during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring helps promote healthy growth, while pruning after flowering maintains its shape and encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant succulents or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense growth habit also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in coastal or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenandra tetragona is a plant native to South Africa, known for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its leaves and roots have been traditionally used to treat ailments such as skin infections and inflammation. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for decorative purposes.
