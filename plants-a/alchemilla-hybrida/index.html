<p>Alchemilla hybrida, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a hardy perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This plant is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it has become a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance landscaping. Its historical use in herbal medicine and its ability to attract pollinators make it a versatile and valuable addition to any garden.</p>
