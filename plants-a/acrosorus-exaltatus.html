<p>Acrosorus exaltatus, commonly known as the tall clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Acrosorus exaltatus thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
