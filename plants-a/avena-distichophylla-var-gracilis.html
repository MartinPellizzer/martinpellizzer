                    <h1>Avena distichophylla var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Avena distichophylla var. gracilis, commonly known as slender two-rowed oat, is a variant of the oat species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two rows of spikelets, a feature typical of the Avena genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it has a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control due to its dense growth.</p>
