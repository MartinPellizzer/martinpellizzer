<p>Alnus firma f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its dense, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, winged fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria.</p>
