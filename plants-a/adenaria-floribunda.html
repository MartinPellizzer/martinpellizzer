                <h1>Adenaria floribunda</h1>
<p>Adenaria floribunda, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense groups. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Adenaria floribunda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenaria floribunda has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fleshy, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenaria floribunda is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It is well adapted to the diverse climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Adenaria floribunda plays an important ecological role in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenaria floribunda was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and competes with native flora for resources.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
