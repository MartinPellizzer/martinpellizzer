                <h1>Adenostyles pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Adenostyles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features erect, branched stems and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Adenostyles pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles pyrenaica has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a spreading, low shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil in its rocky habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles pyrenaica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is found in areas such as Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils. This plant is commonly associated with high-altitude habitats, including alpine meadows and open slopes. It is adapted to the cool and moist conditions typical of these environments.</p>
<p>Adenostyles pyrenaica is often found in association with other endemic species in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles pyrenaica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native range. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, which facilitates its spread. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its distribution and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
