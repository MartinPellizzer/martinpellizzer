                <h1>Acourtia cordata</h1>
<p>Acourtia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf acourtia, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Acourtia cordata is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub environments.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia cordata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia cordata is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Acourtia cordata is often associated with disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to the diverse environmental conditions across these regions of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia cordata was mainly introduced to the western coast of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its distinctive rosette-forming leaves and pinkish flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in coastal areas, often growing in sandy or disturbed soils. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
