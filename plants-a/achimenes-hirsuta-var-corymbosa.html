<p>Achimenes hirsuta var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered achimenes, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and orange. The plant produces clusters of flowers at the ends of its branches, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes hirsuta var. corymbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and is popular in garden borders and containers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes hirsuta var. corymbosa has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly woody at the base, and have a rough texture with a reddish-brown bark. The flowers are tubular with a spurred base, typically pink or red, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes hirsuta var. corymbosa is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid, warm environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded to semi-shaded areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are becoming less common due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes hirsuta var. corymbosa is a tropical flowering plant known for its vibrant, showy blooms and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential. It is susceptible to aphids and powdery mildew, so regular inspection and proper air circulation are important.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
