<p>Acoridium hutchinsonianum, commonly known as the Malagasy water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, spadix-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and supports its aquatic lifestyle.</p>
