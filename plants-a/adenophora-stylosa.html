                <h1>Adenophora stylosa</h1>
<p>Adenophora stylosa, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora stylosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora stylosa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branched, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant establish in moist, woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora stylosa is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas and forested environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with moist, shaded habitats. Its natural range extends across various provinces in China, especially in regions with a subtropical to temperate climate.</p>
<p>Adenophora stylosa is an important part of the local flora and is often found in meadows and along stream sides.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora stylosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it was not originally native. The plant's adaptability to various environmental conditions has contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
