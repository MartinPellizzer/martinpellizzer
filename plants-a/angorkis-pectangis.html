<p>Angorkis pectangis, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs that give it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Angorkis pectangis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
