                <h1>Adyseton calycinum</h1>
<p>Adyseton calycinum, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem and broad, palmate leaves that are typically green and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton calycinum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton calycinum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal plain regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and other wetland habitats. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and frequent rainfall, typical of the Atlantic coastal plain. It is often associated with disturbed or transitional zones between aquatic and terrestrial environments.</p>
<p>Adyseton calycinum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of these wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton calycinum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, spreading rapidly through its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
