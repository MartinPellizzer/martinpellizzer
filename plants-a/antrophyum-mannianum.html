                    <h1>Antrophyum mannianum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum mannianum, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a large, slow-growing evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its historical significance includes being used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes and as a source of food.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
