                            <h1>Acrocephalus Indicus</h1>
<p>Indian bulrush, scientifically known as Acrocephalus indicus, is a hardy aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow waters and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. With its tall, narrow leaves and distinctive spikes of small, greenish flowers, it plays a vital role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. The plant is not only an important habitat for various waterfowl and insects but also helps in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its resilience and adaptability make it a key component of wetland biodiversity.</p>
