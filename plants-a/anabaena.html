                    <h1>Anabaena</h1>
<p>Anabaena, commonly known as a type of cyanobacteria, is a filamentous aquatic organism that plays a significant role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>It contains specialized cells called heterocysts that enable it to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. Anabaena thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, often forming visible surface scums during warm weather. It is a pioneer species in ecological succession and contributes to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically and agriculturally important.</p>
