                <h1>Achillea javorkae</h1>
<p>Achillea javorkae, commonly known as the Javornik yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea javorkae has leaves that are basal, arranged in a rosette, with lanceolate to linear shapes, grayish-green in color, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea javorkae is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and southern Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific habitats in the Altai Mountains and surrounding areas. It thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often found in open, sunny environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea javorkae is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea javorkae is a perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and hardy nature, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea javorkae involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea javorkae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea javorkae is a lesser-known species of the yarrow genus, primarily found in specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it shares some properties with other yarrow species that may have historical uses in cooking. In medicinal contexts, it may have potential due to its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though research is limited. Its role in industrial and economic applications is minimal, as it is not cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though it is not as prominent as other yarrow varieties in folklore or symbolism.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea javorkae has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Lavender Glow' and 'Silver Queen,' which are known for their striking foliage and extended blooming periods. While there are no widely recognized hybrids specifically bred for Achillea javorkae, it is often crossbred with other yarrow species to enhance traits like flower color and disease resistance. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its use in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This plant is a valuable addition to modern gardens due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
