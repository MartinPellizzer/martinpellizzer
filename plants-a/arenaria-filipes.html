                    <h1>Arenaria filipes</h1>
<p>Arenaria filipes, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also be cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
