                <h1>Acer sinense var. pubinerve</h1>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve, commonly known as the hairy-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five lobes and hairy veins, which give it its botanical name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with greenish-yellow sepals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, providing stability and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve is a rare variant of the Chinese maple, native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited and primarily confined to its native range due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements. It thrives in temperate environments with moist, well-drained soils, often found in mixed forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where the climate is cool and humid.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in urban and rural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve is a lesser-known species of maple known for its ornamental value in horticulture, often cultivated for its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been historically used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported cooling properties. The tree's wood, though not as economically significant as other maple varieties, can be used in small-scale woodworking and craft industries. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in certain regions of China, representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role lies in ecological and aesthetic contributions rather than extensive industrial or medicinal use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sinense var. pubinerve has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Tiger Eyes,' which are known for their striking foliage patterns.</p>
<p>This species also serves as a parent in various hybrids, such as the popular 'Autumn Flame' and 'Emerald Queen,' which combine traits from different maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced fall color and improved hardiness, making them valuable in horticulture. The cultivars and hybrids of Acer sinense var. pubinerve are highly sought after for their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add diversity and visual interest to temperate climates.</p>
