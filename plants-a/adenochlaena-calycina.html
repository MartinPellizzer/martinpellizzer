                <h1>Adenochlaena calycina</h1>
<p>Adenochlaena calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2–5 meters. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are usually pink or red in color, with five lobed petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena calycina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena calycina has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 2–5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, winged structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena calycina is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tonga, and Samoa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena calycina is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena calycina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
