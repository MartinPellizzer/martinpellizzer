                <h1>Acnistus umbellatus</h1>
<p>Acnistus umbellatus, commonly known as the white bead vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fruits are spherical, fleshy berries that mature to a red or orange color, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Acnistus umbellatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus umbellatus has simple, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbellate inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus umbellatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its distribution extends to some islands in the Pacific, such as Madagascar and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly known as the "umbrella plant" due to its distinctive, umbrella-like flower clusters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus umbellatus was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in degraded habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive rhizomes, making it an aggressive invader in native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to the displacement of native vegetation in several countries.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a weed in many areas where it has been introduced.</p>
