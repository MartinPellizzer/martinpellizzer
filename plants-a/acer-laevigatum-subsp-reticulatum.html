                <h1>Acer laevigatum subsp. reticulatum</h1>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and has a spreading, rounded crown. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and borne in upright clusters, while the fruit is a samara with a slender wing.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum has palmately lobed leaves that are finely toothed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender and smooth, with a light gray bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect and restore its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum is a decorative tree known for its unique foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this species is relatively slow, with steady development over several years, reaching maturity in about 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its presence also aids in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has potential medicinal applications due to its reported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood is valued for fine woodworking due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than utilitarian in modern contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>reticulatum has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors. It also has several hybrids with other maples, contributing to the diversity of ornamental tree varieties.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates. Their ornamental value makes them a favorite among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>Overall, they play a significant role in enhancing the visual appeal of gardens and public spaces.</p>
