                <h1>Adiantopsis cheilanthoides</h1>
<p>Adiantopsis cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantopsis cheilanthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shade gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis cheilanthoides has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets arranged in a bipinnate pattern, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, and exhibiting a dark green color with a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with separate male and female structures, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis cheilanthoides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is found in regions of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. This fern thrives in moist, shaded forest understories and rocky areas. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis cheilanthoides was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil, often near streams or in forest understories. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and California. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
