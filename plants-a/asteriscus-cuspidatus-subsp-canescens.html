<p>Asteriscus cuspidatus subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the white aster or desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green, hairy, and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
