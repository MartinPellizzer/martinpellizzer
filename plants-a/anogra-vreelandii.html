<p>Anogra vreelandii, commonly known as the Vreeland's anogra, is a rare and unusual plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white, and it produces tiny, spherical fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anogra vreelandii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
