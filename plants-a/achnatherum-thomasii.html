                <h1>Achnatherum thomasii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Achnatherum thomasii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum thomasii has grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and blade-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a flat arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and usually stands upright, with a smooth texture and a light green to grayish color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like flower clusters, with inconspicuous white to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum thomasii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in countries such as Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often found in arid to semi-arid environments. This plant is well adapted to cold and dry conditions, making it a common species in alpine and steppe ecosystems. It is typically found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum thomasii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, and California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, railroads, and grazing lands. This plant has a preference for dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native, it has adapted well to the local environment in these regions.</p>
