                <h1>Aceras calcaratum</h1>
<p>Aceras calcaratum, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive central spur.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aceras calcaratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aceras calcaratum is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Cyprus, and Syria.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in dry, rocky environments such as cliffs and slopes, often in well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Aceras calcaratum is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aceras calcaratum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant known for its delicate blue flowers and foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This perennial grows best in early spring, blooming in late spring to early summer, and enters dormancy in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead or damaged stems after flowering.</p>
<p>It is generally pest and disease resistant but may attract aphids or slugs; companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aceras calcaratum is a hardy flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Aceras calcaratum contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and shelter to a variety of insects and animals.</p>
