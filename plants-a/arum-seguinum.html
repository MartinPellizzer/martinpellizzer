<p>Arum seguinum, commonly known as the Seguin arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is often adorned with a distinctive purple or reddish margin. The plant produces a spathe, a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, which is the actual flowering structure. The spathe is typically a deep purple or maroon color, contrasting with the green spadix.</p>
<p>Arum seguinum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
