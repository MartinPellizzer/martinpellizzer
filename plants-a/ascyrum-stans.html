<p>Ascyrum stans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Ascyrum stans is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
