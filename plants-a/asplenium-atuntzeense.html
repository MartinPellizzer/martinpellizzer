<p>Asplenium atuntzeense, commonly known as the Atuntze spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic or lithophytic, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium atuntzeense is native to parts of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in montane forests.</p>
