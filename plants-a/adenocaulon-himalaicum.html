<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon himalaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon himalaicum has small, hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing in a low, spreading pattern. It produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
