                <h1>Acilepis peninsularis</h1>
<p>Acilepis peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular acilepis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of绒毛, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis peninsularis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a subtle pink hue, blooming in late spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis peninsularis is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and parts of Karnataka. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments such as forests and shrublands. It is commonly associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis peninsularis was mainly introduced to the western coast of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal habitats with sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in dunes and along the edges of coastal forests. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and flowering patterns.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
