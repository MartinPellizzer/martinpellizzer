                        <h1>Acacia niopo</h1>
<p>Acacia niopo, commonly known as the Niopo tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and bipinnate leaves that are composed of numerous small leaflets. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in globular inflorescences, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Acacia niopo is adapted to coastal and dry inland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia niopo is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and coastal areas. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Acacia niopo is also known for its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia niopo was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has been widely planted in countries such as Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji to combat erosion and restore degraded lands. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, careful management is needed to prevent it from becoming a problematic weed.</p>
