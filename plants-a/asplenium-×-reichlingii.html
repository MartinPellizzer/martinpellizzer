                    <h1>Asplenium × reichlingii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × reichlingii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, though it does not produce viable spores due to its sterile nature.</p>
<p>Asplenium × reichlingii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
