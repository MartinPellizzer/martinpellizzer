                <h1>Acmella hirta</h1>
<p>Acmella hirta, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant features small, yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, and its leaves are hairy, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats.</p>
<p>Acmella hirta is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella hirta has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellow with a reddish center, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella hirta is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments and is commonly found in grasslands, wetlands, and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to warm climates and is often part of the understory vegetation in tropical forests. It is also known to grow in disturbed areas such as abandoned fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains in South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella hirta was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and coastal dunes. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora for resources.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread through manual removal and herbicide application.</p>
