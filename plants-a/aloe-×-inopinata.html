                    <h1>Aloe × inopinata</h1>
<p>Aloe × inopinata, commonly known as the hybrid aloe or the hybrid aloe plant, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a thin, whitish layer called the cuticle. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, which are often followed by the development of small, red berries. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, contributing to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
