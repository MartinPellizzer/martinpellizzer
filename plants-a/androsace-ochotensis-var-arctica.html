<p>Androsace ochotensis var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology includes hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
