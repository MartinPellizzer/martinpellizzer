                    <h1>Adipe longicornis</h1>
<p>Adipe longicornis, commonly known as the longhorned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant's most distinctive feature is its elongated, curved seed pods, which contain numerous tiny seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adipe longicornis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
