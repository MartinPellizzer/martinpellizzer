<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas such as meadows and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The yellow coloration of its inflorescence is a distinguishing feature of this variety.</p>
