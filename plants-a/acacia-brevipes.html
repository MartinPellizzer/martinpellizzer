                    <h1>Acacia brevipes</h1>
<p>Acacia brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf acacia or the yellow-wood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like stems that perform the function of leaves, adapting to the harsh, dry environment. Acacia brevipes is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>It also provides habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
