                    <h1>Aetheopappus pyrrhoblepharus</h1>
<p>Aetheopappus pyrrhoblepharus, commonly known as the red-eyed pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called pappi. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, often surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its striking red eyespots on the flower heads, which may serve to attract pollinators or deter herbivores.</p>
