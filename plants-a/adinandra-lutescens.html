                <h1>Adinandra lutescens</h1>
<p>Adinandra lutescens, commonly known as the yellow adinandra, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Adinandra lutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra lutescens has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lutescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This species thrives in shaded undergrowth, often growing along forest floors or on rocky outcrops. Its natural range extends to parts of Malaysia and New Guinea as well.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is now considered a rare and endangered species in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lutescens was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns as it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, proper management is necessary to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
