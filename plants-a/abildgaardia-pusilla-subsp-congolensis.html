<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>congolensis, commonly known as the Congo dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to central Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a short, narrow lip that is characteristic of the genus. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
