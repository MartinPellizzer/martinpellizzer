                        <h1>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp. congolensis</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>congolensis, commonly known as the Congo dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to central Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a short, narrow lip that is characteristic of the genus. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>congolensis is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa, particularly in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, and Gabon. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the understory of dense forest canopies. The subspecies is adapted to the warm and moist climate of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific ecological conditions of the Congo Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>congolensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky outcrops. It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in parts of Central and West Africa, where it has been documented in countries like Cameroon, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many of these areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
