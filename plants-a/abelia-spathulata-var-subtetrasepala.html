                <h1>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala</h1>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala, commonly known as the broad-leaf abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically four-lobed, though the varietal name suggests a variation with four stamens.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala has elliptic to ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a slightly woody texture, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are fragrant, tubular with four sepals, and display a pale pink to white color, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala is a rare plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in high-altitude areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala is a compact, evergreen shrub known for its fragrant, tubular flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in spring or by division of the roots during the dormant season. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or coniferous trees can enhance its appearance and provide beneficial microclimates.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and nesting sites for small birds and insects. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its attractive appearance and beneficial insect habitat. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports local biodiversity by attracting a wide range of wildlife and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala is a lesser-known ornamental plant primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional medicine for its potential antimicrobial properties. Its role in industrial and economic contexts is limited, though it could contribute to local horticultural industries. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions where it is native.</p>
<p>Overall, its main application remains in ornamental horticulture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. subtetrasepala has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Karl Foerster' and 'Rosea,' known for their striking floral displays and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is also the parent of numerous hybrids, such as Abelia Ã— grandiflora, which combine the hardiness of Abelia with the showy flowers of other species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions, making it a versatile choice for landscape design. The plant's unique foliage and long blooming season further enhance its appeal to gardeners.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic qualities, it remains a valuable addition to both public and private gardens.</p>
