                    <h1>Ananas lyman-smithii</h1>
<p>Ananas lyman-smithii, commonly known as the Lyman-Smith pineapple, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a unique, spiky pineapple-like fruit that is rarely seen in the wild due to its limited distribution. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical species from habitat loss and other threats.</p>
